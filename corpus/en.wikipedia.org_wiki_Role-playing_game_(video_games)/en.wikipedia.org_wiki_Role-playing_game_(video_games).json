    "transformers_text": "Role playing video games also known as computer role playing games C RPG comprise a broad video game genre generally defined by a detailed story and character advancement often through increasing characters ' levels or other skills Role playing games almost always feature combat as a defining feature and traditionally used turn based combat however modern role playing games commonly feature real time action combat or even non violent forms of conflict resolution with some eschewing combat altogether Further many games have incorporated role playing elements such as character advancement and quests while remaining within other genres Role playing video games have their origins in table top role playing games 1 and use much of the same terminology settings and game mechanics Other major similarities with pen and paper games include developed story telling and narrative elements player character development and elaborately designed fantasy worlds The electronic medium takes the place of the game master resolving combat on its own and determining the game's response to different player actions RPGs have evolved from simple text based console window games into visually rich 3 D experiences The first RPGs date to the mid 1970 s when developers attempted to implement systems like Dungeons Dragons on university mainframe computers While initially niche RPGs would soon become mainstream on consoles like the NES with franchises such as Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy Western RPGs for home computers became popular through series such as Fallout The Elder Scrolls and Baldur's Gate Today RPGs enjoy significant popularity both as mainstream AAA games and as niche titles aimed towards dedicated audiences More recently independent developers have found success with games such as OFF Under tale and Omori achieving both critical and commercial success Role playing video games use much of the same terminology settings and game mechanics as early table top role playing games such as Dungeons Dragons 2 Players control a central game character or multiple game characters usually called a party These characters are controlled by issuing commands which are then performed by the character at an effectiveness determined by that character's numeric attributes Often these attributes increase each time a character gains a level and a character's level goes up each time the player accumulates a certain amount of experience 3 Usually the characters attain victory by completing a series of quests or reaching the conclusion of a central storyline Players explore a game world while solving puzzles and engaging in combat Role playing games are traditionally divided into turn based RPGs that rarely challenge a player's physical coordination or reaction time and action based RPGs that do the opposite 4 Role playing video games typically rely on a highly developed story and setting 5 and characters are typically designed by the player 1 Role playing video games also typically attempt to offer more complex and dynamic character interaction than what is found in other video game genres This usually involves additional focus on the artificial intelligence and scripted behavior of computer controlled non player characters 4 6 In order to be considered a role playing game characters have to become more functionally powerful by gaining new skills weapons and magic This creates a positive feedback cycle that is central to these games the player grows in power allowing them to overcome more difficult challenges and gain even more power 4 This is part of the appeal of the genre where players experience growing from an ordinary person into a superhero with amazing powers Whereas other games give the player these powers immediately the player in a role playing game will choose their powers and skills as they gain experience 4 Three different systems of rewarding the player characters for solving the tasks in the game can be set apart the experience system also known as the level based system the training system also known as the skill based system and the skill point system also known as level free system In some video games from the Eighties and Nineties the score was called Experience in game but this did not make them role playing games if there was no character development The premise of many role playing games tasks the player with saving the world or whichever level of society is threatened citation needed There are often twists and turns as the story progresses such as the surprise appearance of estranged relatives or enemies who become friends or vice versa 4 The game world is often rooted in speculative fiction i e fantasy or science fiction 7 which allows players to do things they cannot do in real life and helps players suspend their disbelief about the rapid character growth To a lesser extent settings closer to the present day or near future are possible 4 The story often provides much of the entertainment in the game Because these games have strong storylines they can often make effective use of recorded dialog and voiceover narration Players of these games tend to appreciate long cutscenes more than players of faster action games While most games advance the plot when the player defeats an enemy or completes a level role playing games often progress the plot based on other important decisions For example a player may make the decision to join a guild thus triggering a progression in the storyline that is usually irreversible New elements in the story may also be triggered by mere arrival in an area rather than completing a specific challenge The plot is usually divided so that each game location is an opportunity to reveal a new chapter in the story 4 Pen and paper role playing games typically involve a player called the game master or GM for short who can dynamically create the story setting and rules and react to a player's choices 8 In role playing video games the computer performs the function of the game master This offers the player a smaller set of possible actions since computers can't engage in imaginative acting comparable to a skilled human game master In exchange the typical role playing video game may have storyline branches user interfaces and stylized cutscenes and gameplay to offer a more direct storytelling mechanism Characterization of non player characters in video games is often handled using a dialog tree Saying the right things to the right non player characters will elicit useful information for the player and may even result in other rewards such as items or experience as well as opening up possible storyline branches Multiplayer online role playing games can offer an exception to this contrast by allowing human interaction among multiple players and in some cases enabling a player to perform the role of a game master 4 9 Exploring the world is an important aspect of many RPGs 4 Players will walk through talking to non player characters picking up objects and avoiding traps 4 Some games such as Net Hack Diablo and the FATE series randomize the structure of individual levels increasing the game's variety and replay value 4 Role playing games where players complete quests by exploring randomly generated dungeons and which include perm a death are called rogue likes named after the 1980 video game Rogue 10 The game's story is often mapped on to exploration where each chapter of the story is mapped on to a different location RPGs usually allow players to return to previously visited locations Usually there is nothing left to do there although some locations change throughout the story and offer the player new things to do in response Players must acquire enough power to overcome a major challenge in order to progress to the next area and this structure can be compared to the boss characters at the end of levels in action games 4 The player typically must complete a linear sequence of certain quests in order to reach the end of the game's story Many RPGs also often allow the player to seek out optional side quests and character interactions Quests of this sort can be found by talking to a non player character and there may be no penalty for abandoning or ignoring these quests other than a missed opportunity or reward 4 Players can find loot such as clothing weapons and armor throughout the game world and collect it 4 Players can trade items for currency and better equipment Trade takes place while interacting with certain friendly non player characters such as shopkeepers and often uses a specialized trading screen Purchased items go into the player's inventory Some games turn inventory management into a logistical challenge by limiting the size of the player's inventory thus forcing the player to decide what they must carry at the time 11 This can be done by limiting the maximum weight that a player can carry by employing a system of arranging items in a virtual space or by simply limiting the number of items that can be held 4 Most of the actions in a Role Playing Game are performed indirectly with the player selecting an action and the character performing it by their own accord 4 Success at that action depends on the character's numeric attributes Role playing video games often simulate dice rolling mechanics from non electronic role playing games to determine success or failure As a character's attributes improve their chances of succeeding at a particular action will increase 4 Many role playing games allow players to play as an evil character Although robbing and murdering indiscriminately may make it easier to get money there are usually consequences in that other characters will become uncooperative or even hostile towards the player Thus these games allow players to make moral choices but force players to live with the consequences of their actions 4 Games often let the player control an entire party of characters However if winning is contingent upon the survival of a single character then that character effectively becomes the player's avatar 4 An example of this would be in Baldur's Gate where if the character created by the player dies the game ends and a previous save needs to be loaded 12 Although some single player role playing games give the player an avatar that is largely predefined for the sake of telling a specific story many role playing games make use of a character creation screen This allows players to choose their character's sex their race or species and their character class Although many of these traits are cosmetic there are functional aspects as well Character classes will have different abilities and strengths Common classes include fighters spell casters thieves with stealth abilities and clerics with healing abilities or a mixed class such as a fighter who can cast simple spells Characters will also have a range of physical attributes such as dexterity and strength which affect a player's performance in combat Mental attributes such as intelligence may affect a player's ability to perform and learn spells while social attributes such as charisma may limit the player's choices while conversing with non player characters These attribute systems often strongly resemble the Dungeons Dragons rule set 4 13 Some role playing games make use of magical powers or equivalents such as psychic powers or advanced technology These abilities are confined to specific characters such as mages spell casters or magic users In games where the player controls multiple characters these magic users usually complement the physical strength of other classes Magic can be used to attack defend or temporarily change an enemy or ally's attributes While some games allow players to gradually consume a spell as ammunition is consumed by a gun most games offer players a finite amount of man a which can be spent on any spell Man a is restored by resting or by consuming potions Characters can also gain other non magical skills which stay with the character for as long as the character lives 4 Role playing games may have the player focus only on a single character throughout the game the character may be joined by computer controlled allies outside of the player's control Other games feature a party that the player can create at the start or gather from non player characters in the game coming into partial or full control of the player during the game Older games often separated combat into its own mode of gameplay distinct from exploring the game world More recent games tend to maintain a consistent perspective for exploration and combat 4 Some games especially earlier video games generate battles from random encounters more modern RPGs are more likely to have persistent wandering monsters that move about the game world independently of the player Most RPGs also use stationary boss monsters in key positions and automatically trigger battles with them when the PCs enter these locations or perform certain actions citation needed Combat options typically involve positioning characters selecting which enemy to attack and exercising special skills such as casting spells 4 In a classical turn based system only one character may act at a time all other characters remain still with a few exceptions that may involve the use of special abilities The order in which the characters act is usually dependent on their attributes such as speed or agility This system rewards strategic planning more than quickness It also points to the fact that realism in games is a means to the end of immersion in the game world not an end in itself A turn based system makes it possible for example to run within range of an opponent and kill them before they get a chance to act or duck out from behind hard cover fire and retreat back without an opponent being able to fire which are of course both impossibilities However tactical possibilities have been created by this unreality that did not exist before the player determines whether the loss of immersion in the reality of the game is worth the satisfaction gained from the development of the tactic and its successful execution Fallout has been cited as being a good example of such a system 14 Real time combat can import features from action games creating a hybrid action RPG game genre But other RPG battle systems such as the Final Fantasy battle systems have imported real time choices without emphasizing coordination or reflexes Other systems combine real time combat with the ability to pause the game and issue orders to all characters under his her control when the game is un paused all characters follow the orders they were given This real time with pause system RT wP has been particularly popular in games designed by BioWare The most famous RT wP engine is the Infinity Engine Other names for real time with pause include active pause and semi real time 14 15 Tactical RPG maker Ape iron named their system Smart Pause Mode SPM because it would automatically pause based on a number of user configurable settings 16 Fallout Tactics Brotherhood of Steel and Arca num Of Steam works and Magick Obscura offered players the option to play in either turn based or RT wP mode via a configuration setting The latter also offered a fast turn based mode though all three game modes were criticized for being poorly balanced and oversimplified 17 18 Early Ultima games featured timed turns they were strictly turn based but if the player waited more than a second or so to issue a command the game would automatically issue a pass command allowing the monsters to take a turn while the PCs did nothing citation needed There is a further subdivision by the structure of the battle system in many early games such as Wizardry monsters and the party are arrayed into ranks and can only attack enemies in the front rank with melee weapons Other games such as most of the Ultima series employed duplicates of the miniatures combat system traditionally used in the early role playing games Representations of the player characters and monsters would move around an arena modeled after the surrounding terrain attacking any enemies that are sufficiently close citation needed Earlier role playing video games used a two dimensional top down view or tile based first person view Early action based role playing games often used a side scrolling view Most notably since Ultima Underworld 1992 role playing games started implementing true three dimensional 3 D graphics where players typically navigate the game world from a first or third person perspective However an isometric or aerial top down perspective is common in party based RPGs in order to give the player a clear view of their entire party and their surroundings 19 Role playing games require the player to manage a large amount of information and frequently use a windowed interface For example spell casting characters will often have a menu of spells they can use On the PC players typically use the mouse to click on icons and menu options while console games have the player navigate through menus using a game controller The role playing video game genre began in the mid 1970 s on mainframe computers inspired by pen and paper role playing games such as Dungeons Dragons 20 Several other sources of inspiration for early role playing video games also included table top wargames sports simulation games adventure games such as Colossal Cave Adventure fantasy writings by authors such as J R R Tolkien 21 traditional strategy games such as chess 22 23 and ancient epic literature dating back to Epic of Gilgamesh which followed the same basic structure of setting off in various quests in order to accomplish goals 24 Originally role playing video games were classified into three main styles rogue likes named after Rogue 1980 that focused on exploration of procedurally created mazes dungeon crawlers popularized by Wizardry 1981 that took place within one or few dungeons with little or no interaction with an outer world and open worlds popularized by Ultima 1981 that include an exp lor able world surface with several dungeons cities continents and more After the success of role playing video games such as Ultima and Wizardry which in turn served as the blueprint for Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy the role playing genre eventually diverged into two styles Eastern role playing games and Western role playing games due to cultural differences though roughly mirroring the platform divide between consoles and computers respectively 25 Finally while the first RPGs offered strictly a single player experience the popularity of multiplayer modes rose sharply during the early to mid 1990 s with action role playing games such as Secret of Man a and Diablo With the advent of the Internet multiplayer games have grown to become massively multiplayer online role playing games MMORPG including Lineage Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft 26 The role playing video game genre began in the mid 1970 s as an offshoot of early university mainframe text based RPGs on PDP 10 and Unix based computers such as Dungeon ped it 5 and dnd 27 In 1980 a very popular dungeon crawl er Rogue was released Featuring ASCII graphics where the setting monsters and items were represented by letters and a deep system of gameplay it inspired a whole genre of similar clones on mainframe and home computers called rogue likes One of the earliest role playing video games on a microcomputer was Dungeon n Dragons written by Peter T ref on as and published by C LOAD 1980 This early game published for aT RS 80 Model 1 is just 16 K long and includes a limited word parser command line character generation a store to purchase equipment combat traps to solve and a dungeon to explore 28 Other contemporaneous C RPGs Computer Role Playing Games were Temple of Aps hai Odyssey The Com pleat Ap venture and A kala beth World of Doom the precursor to Ultima Some early microcomputer RPGs such a sTele n gard 1982 or Sword of Far goal were based on their mainframe counterparts while others such as Ultima or Wizardry the most successful of the early C RPGs were loose adaptations of D D citation needed They also include both first person displays and overhead views sometimes in the same game A kala beth for example uses both perspectives Most of the key features of RPGs were developed in this early period prior to the release of Ultima III Exodus one of the prime influences on both computer and console RPG development For example Wizardry features menu driven combat Tunnels of Doom features tactical combat on a special combat screen and Dungeons of Dag gora th features real time combat which takes place on the main dungeon map 29 Starting in 1984 with Quest ron and 50 Mission Crush SSI produced many series of C RPGs Their 1985 game Phantasie is notable for introducing auto mapping and in game scrolls providing hints and background information They also released Pool of Radiance in 1988 the first of several Gold Box C RPGs based on the Advanced Dungeons Dragons rules These games feature a first person display for movement combined with an overhead tactical display for combat One common feature of RPGs from this era which Matt Barton calls the Golden Age of computer RPGs is the use of numbered paragraphs printed in the manual or adjunct booklets containing the game's lengthier texts the player can be directed to read a certain paragraph instead of being shown the text on screen The ultimate exemplar of this approach is Sir Tech's Star Saga trilogy of which only two games were released the first game contains 888 text lets usually much longer than a single paragraph spread across 13 booklets while the second contains 50 000 paragraphs spread across 14 booklets Most of the games from this era are turn based although Dungeon Master and its imitators have real time combat Other classic titles from this era include The Bard's Tale 1985 Wasteland 1988 the start of the Might and Magic 1986 2014 series and the continuing Ultima 1981 1999 series 30 Later in the middle to late 1990 s isometric sprite based RPGs became commonplace with video game publishers Interplay Entertainment and Blizzard North playing a lead role with such titles as the Baldur's Gate Ice wind Dale and the action RPG Diablo series as well as the dialogue heavy Plan escape Torment and cult classics Fallout and Fallout 2 This era also saw a move toward 3 D game engines with such games as Might and Magic VI The Mandate of Heaven and The Elder Scrolls Arena TSR dissatisfied with SSI's later products such as Dark Sun Wake of the Ravage rand Men zob err anz an transferred the AD D license to several different developers and eventually gave it to BioWare who used it in Baldur's Gate 1998 and several later games By the 2000 s 3 D engines had become dominant 31 The earliest RPG on a console was Dragon stomper on the Atari 2600 in 1982 32 Another early RPG on a console was Boko suk a Wars originally released for the Sharp X 1 computer in 1983 33 and later ported to the MSX in 1984 the NES in 1985 and the Sharp X 68000 citation needed as New Boko suk a Wars The game laid the foundations for the tactical role playing game genre or simulation RPG genre as it is known in Japan citation needed It was also an early example of a real time 34 action role playing game 35 36 In 1986 Chunsoft created the NES title Dragon Quest called Dragon Warrior in North America until the eighth game which drew inspiration from computer RPGs Ultima and Wizardry and is regarded as the template for future Japanese role playing video games released since then 37 In 1987 the genre came into its own with the release of several highly influential console RPGs distinguishing themselves from computer RPGs including the genre defining Phantasy Star released for the Master System Shigeru Miyamoto's Zelda II The Adventure of Link for the Famicom Disk System was one of the earliest action role playing games combining the action adventure game framework of its predecessor The Legend of Zelda with the statistical elements of turn based RPGs 38 Most RPGs at this time were turn based 39 Fa xanadu was another early action RPG for the NES released as a side story to the computer action RPG Dragon Slayer II Xanadu 40 Square's Final Fantasy for the NES introduced side view battles with the player characters on the right and the enemies on the left which soon became the norm for numerous console RPGs 41 In 1988 Dragon Warrior III introduced a character progression system allowing the player to change the party's character classes during the course of the game citation needed Another major innovation was the introduction of day night cycles certain items characters and quests are only accessible at certain times of day 42 In 1989 Phantasy Star II for the Genesis established many conventions of the genre including an epic dramatic character driven storyline dealing with serious themes and subject matter 43 Console RPGs distinguished themselves from computer RPGs to a greater degree in the early 1990 s As console RPGs became more heavily story based than their computer counterparts one of the major differences that emerged during this time was in the portrayal of the characters Console RPGs often featured intricately related characters who had distinctive personalities and traits with players assuming the roles of people who cared about each other fell in love or even had families Romance in particular was a theme that was common in most console RPGs at the time but absent from most computer RPGs 44 During the 1990 s console RPGs had become increasingly dominant exerting a greater influence on computer RPGs than the other way around 45 Console RPGs had eclipsed computer RPGs for some time though computer RPGs began making a comeback towards the end of the decade with interactive choice filled adventures 46 The next major revolution came in the late 1990 s which saw the rise of optical disks in fifth generation consoles The implications for RPGs were enormous longer more involved quests better audio and full motion video This was first clearly demonstrated in 1997 by the phenomenal success of Final Fantasy VII which is considered one of the most influential games of all time 47 48 With a record breaking production budget of around 45 million 47 the ambitious scope of Final Fantasy VII raised the possibilities for the genre with its dozens of minigames and much higher production values The latter includes innovations such as the use of 3 D characters on pre rendered backgrounds 49 battles viewed from multiple different angles rather than a single angle and for the first time full motion CGI video seamlessly blended into the gameplay 48 effectively integrated throughout the game 47 The game was soon ported to the PC and gained much success there as did several other originally console RPGs blurring the line between the console and computer platforms 45 Computer driven role playing games had their start in Western markets with games generally geared to be played on home computers By 1985 series like Wizardry and Ultima represented the state of the art in role playing games In Japan home computers had yet to take as great a hold as they had in the West due to their cost there was little market for Western developed games and there were a few Japanese developed games for personal computers during this time such as The Black Onyx 1984 which followed the Wizardry Ultima format With the release of the low cost Famicom console called the Nintendo Entertainment System overseas a new opportunity arose to bring role playing games to Japan Dragon Quest 1986 was the first such attempt to recreate a role playing game for a console and requires several simplifications to fit within the more limited memory and capabilities of the Famicom compared to computers players in Dragon Quest controlled only a single character the amount of control over this character limited due to the simplicity of the Famicom controller and a less realistic art style was chosen to better visualize the characters within a tile based graphics system Dragon Quest was highly successful in Japan leading to further entries in the series and other titles such as Final Fantasy that followed the same simplifications made in RPGs for Dragon Quest 50 Because of these differences the role playing genre began to be classified into two fairly distinct styles computer RPG and console RPG 25 51 52 Note 1 By the early 2000 s the distinction between platforms became less pronounced as the same games appeared on both console and computer but stylistic differences between Western role playing games W RPGs and Japanese role playing games J RPGs remained rooted in the earlier distinctions 53 Though sharing fundamental premises W RPGs tend to feature darker graphics older characters and a greater focus on roaming freedom realism and the underlying game mechanics e g rules based or system based 53 whereas J RPGs tend to feature brighter anime like or chibi graphics younger characters turn based or faster paced action gameplay and a greater focus on tightly orchestrated linear storylines with intricate plots e g action based or story based 53 25 54 55 56 57 58 59 Further W RPGs are more likely to allow players to create and customize characters from scratch 60 and since the late 1990 s have had a stronger focus on extensive dialog tree systems e g Plan escape Torment 61 On the other hand J RPGs tend to limit players to developing pre defined player characters and often do not allow the option to create or choose one's own playable characters or make decisions that alter the plot 59 Note 2 In the early 1990 s J RPGs were seen as being much closer to fantasy novels 63 but by the late 1990 s had become more cinematic in style e g Final Fantasy series At the same time W RPGs started becoming more novelistic in style e g Plan escape Torment but by the late 2000 s had also adopted a more cinematic style e g Mass Effect 61 One reason given for these differences is that many early Japanese console RPGs can be seen as forms of interactive manga or anime wrapped around Western rule systems at the time 64 in addition to the influence of visual novel adventure games 65 As a result Japanese console RPGs differentiated themselves with a stronger focus on scripted narratives and character drama 54 alongside streamlined gameplay 64 In recent years these trends have in turn been adopted by W RPGs which have begun moving more towards tightly structured narratives in addition to moving away from numbers and rules in favor of streamlined combat systems similar to action games 64 66 In addition a large number of Western indie games are modelled after J RPGs 67 especially those of the 16 bit era partly due to the RPG Maker game development tools 64 Another of t cited difference is the prominence or absence of kawa is a or cuteness in Japanese culture and different approaches with respect to character aesthetics 25 W RPGs tend to maintain a serious and gritty tone whereas J RPG protagonists tend to be designed with an emphasis on youth or aesthetic beauty and even male characters are often young androgynous sh nen orbi sh nen in appearance J RPGs often have cute characters juxtaposed with more mature themes and situations and many modern J RPGs feature characters designed in the same style as those in manga and anime 60 The stylistic differences are often due to differing target audiences Western RPGs are usually geared primarily towards teenage to adult males whereas Japanese RPGs are usually intended for a much larger demographic 68 including female audiences 56 who for example accounted for nearly a third of Final Fantasy XIII's player base 69 In 2015 IGN noted in an interview with Xe no blade Chronicles X's development team that the label J RPG is most commonly used to refer to RPGs whose presentation mimics the design sensibilities of anime and manga that it's typically the presentation and character archetypes that signal this is a J RPG 70 Modern J RPGs are more likely to feature turn based battles while modern W RPGs are more likely to feature real time combat 56 59 71 In the past the reverse was often true real time action role playing games were far more common among Japanese console RPGs than Western computer RPGs up until the late 1990 s due to gamepad s usually being better suited to real time action than the keyboard and mouse 72 Some journalists and video game designers have questioned this cultural classification arguing that the differences between Eastern and Western games have been exaggerated In an interview held at the American Electronic Entertainment Expo Japanese video game developer Tetsuya Nomura who worked on Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts emphasized that RPGs should not be classified by country of origin but rather described simply for what they are role playing games 73 Hironobu Sakaguchi creator of Final Fantasy and The Last Story noted that while users like to categorise J RPGs as turn based traditional styles and W RPGs as born from first person shooters there are titles that don't fit the category pointing to Chrono Trigger which he also worked on and the Man a games He further noted that there have been other games similar to the style of Chrono Trigger but that it's probably because the games weren't localised and didn't reach the Western audience 74 Xe no series director Tetsuya Takahashi in reference to Xe no blade Chronicles stated that I don't know when exactly people started using the term ' J RPG ' but if this game makes people rethink the meaning of this term I'll be satisfied The writer Jeremy Parish of 1 UP com states that Xe no blade throws into high relief the sheer artificiality of the gaming community's obsession over the differences between Western and Japanese RPGs pointing out that it does things that don't really fit into either genre Gamers do love their boundaries and barriers and neat little rules I know but just because you cram something into a little box doesn't mean it belongs there 75 Nick Do err of Joy st iq criticizes the claim that J RPGs are too linear pointing out that non linear J RPGs are not uncommon for instance the Romancing SaGa series 76 Likewise Rowan Kaiser of Joy st iq points out that linear W RPGs were common in the 1990 s and argues that many of the often mentioned differences between Eastern and Western games are stereotypes that are generally not true and never was pointing to classic examples like Lands of Lore and Betrayal at K rond or that were more narrative focused than the typical Western style RPGs of the time 53 Due to the cultural differences between Western and Japanese variations of role playing games both have often been compared and critiqued by those within the video games industry and the press In the late 1980 s when traditional American computer RPGs such as Ultima and Defender of the Crown were ported to consoles they received mixed reviews from console gamers as they were not perceived by many of the players to be as exciting as the Japanese imports and lacked the arcade and action adventure elements commonly found in Japanese console RPGs at the time 77 In the early 1990 s American computer RPGs also began facing criticism for their plots where the party sticks together through thick and thin and always act together as a group rather than as individuals and where non player characters are one dimensional characters in comparison to the more fantasy novel approach of Squaresoft console RPGs such as Final Fantasy IV 63 However in 1994 game designer Sandy Petersen noted that among computer gamers there was criticism against cartridge based console J RPGs being not role playing at all due to popular examples such as Secret of Man a and especially The Legend of Zelda using direct arcade style action combat systems instead of the more abstract turn based battle systems associated with computer RPGs In response he pointed out that not all console RPGs are action based pointing to Final Fantasy and Lu fia 78 Another early criticism dating back to the Phantasy Star games in the late 1980 s was the frequent use of defined player characters in contrast to the Wizardry and Gold Box games where the player's avatars such as knights clerics or thieves were blank slates 79 As Japanese console RPGs became increasingly more dominant in the 1990 s 45 and became known for being more heavily story and character based American computer RPGs began to face criticism for having characters devoid of personality or background due to representing avatars which the player uses to interact with the world in contrast to Japanese console RPGs which depicted characters with distinctive personalities American computer RPGs were thus criticized for lacking more of the traditional role playing offered by Japanese console RPGs which instead emphasized character interactions 54 In response North American computer RPGs began making a comeback towards the end of the 1990 s with interactive choice filled adventures 80 Several writers have criticized J RPGs as not being true RPGs for heavy usage of scripted cutscenes and dialogue and a frequent lack of branching outcomes 81 Turner Japanese RPGs are also sometimes criticized for having relatively simple battle systems in which players are able to win by repetitive ly mashing buttons 81 Turner 81 82 Note 3 As a result Japanese style role playing games are held in disdain by some Western gamers leading to the term J RPG being held in the pejorative 71 Some observers have also speculated that J RPGs are stagnating or declining in both quality and popularity including remarks by BioWare co founder Greg Z esch uk and writing director Daniel Erickson that J RPGs are stagnating and that Final Fantasy XIII is not even really an RPG 84 85 86 criticisms regarding seemingly nebulous justifications by some Japanese designers for newly changed or alternately newly un changed features of recent titles 87 calls among some gaming journalists to fix J RPGs ' problems 88 89 90 91 as well as claims that some recent titles such as Front Mission Evolved are beginning to attempt and failing to imitate Western titles 92 In an article for PS M 3 Brittany Vincent of RPG Fan com felt that developers have mired the modern J RPG in un originality citing Square Enix CEO Yoichi Wada who stated that they're strictly catering to a particular audience the article noting the difference in game sales between Japan and North America before going on to suggest J RPGs may need to move forward 93 This criticism has also occurred in the wider media with an advertisement for Fallout New Vegas Obsidian Entertainment in Japan openly mocked Japanese RPGs ' traditional characteristics in favor of their own title 94 Nick Do err of Joy st iq noted that Bethesda felt that J RPGs are all the same and too linear to which he responded that f or the most part it's true but noted there are also non linear J RPGs such as the Romancing SaGa series 76 Such criticisms have produced responses such as ones by Japanese video game developers Shinji Mikami and Yuji Horii to the effect that J RPGs were never as popular in the West to begin with and that Western reviewers are biased against turn based systems 95 96 97 98 Jeff Fleming of Gamasutra also states that Japanese RPGs on home consoles are generally showing signs of staleness but notes that handheld consoles such as the Nintendo DS have had more original and experimental Japanese RPGs released in recent years 99 Western RPGs have also received criticism in recent years They remain less popular in Japan where until recently Western games in general had a negative reputation 57 In Japan where the vast majority of early console role playing video games originate 100 Western RPGs remain largely unknown 101 The developer Moto mu Toriyama criticized Western RPGs stating that they dump you in a big open world and let you do whatever you like which makes it difficult to tell a compelling story 102 Hironobu Sakaguchi noted that users like to categorise W RPGs as a sort of different style born from first person shooters 74 In recent years some have also criticized W RPGs for becoming less RPG like instead with further emphasis on action 64 Christian Nut t of GameSpy states that in contrast to J RPGs W RPGs ' greater control over the development and customization of playable characters has come at the expense of plot and gameplay resulting in what he felt was generic dialogue lack of character development within the narrative and weaker battle systems 81 Nut t He also states that W RPGs tend to focus more on the underlying rules governing the battle system rather than on the experience itself 81 Nut t Tom Bat tey of Edge Magazine noted that the problems often cited against J RPGs also often apply to many W RPGs as well as games outside of the RPG genre 90 BioWare games have been criticized for lack of innovation repetitive structure and lack of real choice 103 W RPGs such as Bethesda games have also been criticized for lacking in narrative strength or mechanical intricacy due to the open ended sandbox structure of their games 104 Despite the criticisms leveled at both variations Rowan Kaiser of Joy st iq argued that many of the often mentioned differences between Eastern and Western games are stereotypes that are generally not true noting various similarities between several Western titles such as Lands of Lore Betrayal at K rond or and Dragon Age and several classic Eastern titles such as Final Fantasy and Phantasy Star noting that both these Western and Japanese titles share a similar emphasis on linear storytelling pre defined characters and bright colored graphics 53 The developer Hironobu Sakaguchi also noted there are many games from both that don't fit such categorizations such as his own Chrono Trigger as well as the Man a games noting there have been many other such Japanese role playing games that never released in Western markets 74 Christianity is a minority religion in Japan and depictions of Christian symbolism and themes in Japanese media are fraught with potential controversy This tends to be problematic when J RPGs are exported to Western countries such as the United States where the topics of religion and blasphemy remain sensitive 105 A J RPG can exhibit elements that would be controversial in the West such as Xe no gears or Final Fantasy Tactics featuring antagonists that bear similarities to the Abrahamic God 106 and the Catholic Church 107 respectively negative depictions of organized religions and characters banding together and killing God 108 Nintendo has made efforts in the past to remove references such as these prior to introducing their games into the North American market 25 Typically action RPGs feature each player directly controlling a single character in real time and feature a strong focus on combat and action with plot and character interaction kept to a minimum Early action RPGs tended to follow the template set by 1980 s Nihon Falco m titles such as the Dragon Slayer andYs series which feature hack and slash combat where the player character's movements and actions are controlled directly using a keyboard or game controller rather than using menus 109 This formula was refined by the action adventure game The Legend of Zelda 1986 which set the template used by many subsequent action RPGs including innovations such as an open world nonlinear gameplay battery backup saving 110 and an attack button that animates a sword swing or projectile attack on the screen 111 112 The game was largely responsible for the surge of action oriented RPGs released since the late 1980 s both in Japan and North America 113 The Legend of Zelda series would continue to exert an influence on the transition of both console and computer RPGs from stat heavy turn based combat towards real time action combat in the following decades 114 A different variation of the action RPG formula was popularized by Diablo 1996 where the majority of commands such as moving and attacking are executed using mouse clicks rather than via menus though learned spells can also be assigned to hot keys In many action RPGs non player characters serve only one purpose be it to buy or sell items or upgrade the player's abilities or issue them with combat centric quests Problems players face also often have an action based solution such as breaking a wooden door open with an axe rather than finding the key needed to unlock it though some games place greater emphasis on character attributes such as a lock picking skill and puzzle solving citation needed One common challenge in developing action RPGs is including content beyond that of killing enemies With the sheer number of items locations and monsters found in many such games it can be difficult to create the needed depth to offer players a unique experience tailored to his or her beliefs choices or actions 109 This is doubly true if a game makes use of random iz ation as is common One notable example of a game which went beyond this is Deus Ex 2000 which offered multiple solutions to problems using intricately layered story options and individually constructed environments 109 Instead of simply bashing their way through levels players were challenged to act in character by choosing dialog options appropriately and by using the surrounding environment intelligently This produced an experience that was unique and tailored to each situation as opposed to one that repeated itself endlessly 109 At one time action RPGs were much more common on consoles than on computers 115 Though there had been attempts at creating action oriented computer RPGs during the late 1980 s and early 1990 s often in the vein of Zelda very few saw any success with the 1992 game Ultima VII being one of the more successful exceptions in North America 115 On the PC Diablo's effect on the market was significant it had many imitators and its style of combat went on to be used by many games that came after For many years afterwards games that closely mimicked the Diablo formula were referred to as Diablo clones 116 Three of the four titles in the series were still sold together as part of the Diablo Battle Chest over a decade after Diablo's release Other examples of action RPGs for the PC include Dungeon Siege Sacred Torchlight and Hell gate London the last of which was developed by a team headed by former Blizzard employees some of whom had participated in the creation of the Diablo series 116 117 Like Diablo and Rogue before it Torchlight and Hell gate London made use of procedural generation to generate game levels 118 119 Also included within this subgenre are role playing shooters games that incorporate elements of role playing games and shooter games including first person and third person Recent examples include the Mass Effect series 109 120 Fallout New Vegas Borderlands 2 and The 3 rd Birthday This subgenre consists of RPGs where the player leads a party of adventurers in first person perspective typically through a dungeon or labyrinth in a grid based environment citation needed Examples include the aforementioned Wizardry Might and Magic and Bard's Tale series as well as the E tri an Odyssey and Elm in age series Games of this type are sometimes called blob be rs since the player moves the entire party around the playing field as a single unit or blob 121 122 Most blob be rs are turn based but some titles such as the Dungeon Master Legend of Grim rock and Eye of the Beholder series are played in real time Early games in this genre lacked an auto map feature forcing players to draw their own maps in order to keep track of their progress citation needed Environmental and spatial puzzles are common meaning players may need to for instance move a stone in one part of the level in order to open a gate in another part of the level citation needed Though many of the original RPGs for the PLATO mainframe system in the late 1970 s also supported multiple simultaneous players 123 the popularity of multiplayer modes in mainstream RPGs did not begin to rise sharply until the early to mid 1990 s 26 For instance Secret of Man a 1993 an early action role playing game by Square was one of the first commercial RPGs to feature cooperative multiplayer gameplay offering two player and three player action once the main character had acquired his party members 124 125 Later Diablo 1997 would combine C RPG and action game elements with an Internet multiplayer mode that allowed up to four players to enter the same world and fight monsters trade items or fight against each other Also during this time period the MUD genre that had been spawned by MUD 1 in 1978 was undergoing a tremendous expansion phase due to the release and spread of LP Mud 1989 and Dik u MUD 1991 Soon driven by the mainstream adoption of the Internet these parallel trends merged in the popularization of graphical MUDs which would soon become known as massively multiplayer online role playing games or MMORPGs 126 127 beginning with games like Meridian 59 1995 Nexus The Kingdom of the Winds 1996 Ultima Online 1997 Lineage 1998 and Ever Quest 1999 and leading to more modern phenomena such as RuneScape 2001 Ragnarok Online 2002 Final Fantasy XI 2003 Eve Online 2003 Disney's Toontown Online 2003 and World of Warcraft 2004 Although superficially similar to single player RPGs MMORPGs lend their appeal more to the socializing influences of being online with hundreds or even thousands of other players at a time and trace their origins more from MUDs than from C RPGs like Ultima and Wizardry Rather than focusing on the old school considerations of memorizing huge numbers of stats and esoteric a and battling it out in complex tactical environments players instead spend much of their time forming and maintaining guilds and clans The distinction between C RPGs and MMORPGs and MUDs can as a result be very sharp liken able to the difference between attending a renaissance fair and reading a good fantasy novel 45 Single player games are great and I love them They have a great feature Your life is very special You are the hero and you get to save the whole world Tabula Rasa is like Disney World You can go to shops and get food but when you get on the boat for the pirate ride you're in your own version of reality Once the ride starts you are blissfully unaware of the boats in front of you and behind you Further MMORPGs have been criticized for diluting the epic feeling of single player RPGs and related media among thousands of concurrent adventurers Stated simply every player wants to be The Hero slay The Monster rescue The Princess or obtain The Magic Sword But when there are thousands of players all playing the same game clearly not everyone can be the hero 128 This problem became obvious to some in the game Ever Quest where groups of players would compete and sometimes harass each other in order to get monsters in the same dungeon to drop valuable items leading to several undesirable behaviors such as kill stealing spawn camping and ninja looting 129 130 131 In response for instance by Richard Garriott in Tabula Rasa 2007 128 developers began turning to instance dungeons as a means of reducing competition over limited resources as well as preserving the gaming experience though this mechanic has its own set of detractors 132 Lastly there exist markets such as Korea and China that while saturated with MMORPGs have so far proved relatively un receptive to single player RPGs 66 For instance Internet connected personal computers are relatively common in Korea when compared to other regions particularly in the numerous PC bangs scattered around the country where patrons are able to pay to play multiplayer video games possibly due to historical bans on Japanese imports as well as a culture that traditionally sees video games as frivolous toys and computers as educational 133 As a result some have wondered whether the stand alone single player RPG is still viable commercially especially on the personal computer when there are competing pressures such as big name publishers ' marketing needs video game piracy a change in culture and the competitive price point to processing power ratio at least initially of modern console systems 45 66 134 Note 4 A monster taming game also known as a monster catching game is a subgenre of role playing games that most notably includes the Pok mon franchise While Pok mon is the most recognizable example of such a game to Western audiences the origins of the genre were in the Mega mi Tense i series which involved fighting negotiating with and recruiting demons and other mythological beings Rogue like is a subgenre of role playing video games characterized by procedural generation of game levels turn based gameplay tile based graphics permanent death of the player character and typically based on a high fantasy narrative setting Rogue likes descend from the 1980 game Rogue particularly mirroring Rogue's character or sprite based graphics 135 136 These games were popularized among college students and computer programmers of the 1980 s and 1990 s leading to a large number of variants but adhering to these common gameplay elements Some of the more well known variants include Hack Net Hack Ancient Domains of Mystery Moria Ang band and Tales of Maj ' Eyal 137 The Japanese series of Mystery Dungeon games by Chunsoft inspired by Rogue also fall within the concept of rogue like games 138 More recently with more powerful home computers and gaming systems new variations of rogue likes incorporating other gameplay genres thematic elements and graphical styles have become popular typically retaining the notion of procedural generation These titles are sometimes labeled as rogue like like rogue lite or procedural death labyrinths to reflect the variation from titles which mimic the gameplay of traditional rogue likes more faithfully 138 Other games like Diablo 139 and UnReal World 140 took inspiration from rogue likes Sandbox RPGs or open world RPGs allow the player a great amount of freedom and usually feature a more open free roaming world meaning the player is not confined to a single path restricted by rocks or fences etc citation needed Sandbox RPGs possess similarities to other sandbox games such as the Grand Theft Auto series with a large number of interact able NPCs large amount of content and typically some of the largest worlds to explore and longest play times of all RPGs due to an impressive amount of secondary content not critical to the game's main storyline Sandbox RPGs often attempt to emulate an entire region of their setting citation needed Popular examples of this subgenre include the Dragon Slayer series by Nihon Falco m the early Dragon Quest games by Chunsoft The Legend of Zelda and Pok mon Scarlet and Violet by Nintendo Wasteland by Interplay Entertainment the SaGa and Man a series by Squaresoft System Shock and System Shock 2 by Looking Glass Studios and Irrational Games Deus Ex by Ion Storm The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series by Bethesda Softworks and Interplay Entertainment Fable by Lion head Studios and Playground Games the Gothic series by Piranha Bytes the Xe no blade Chronicles series by Monolith Soft and the Dark Souls series by From Software citation needed This subgenre of turn based role playing games principally refers to games which incorporate elements from strategy games as an alternative to traditional role playing game RPG systems 141 Tactical RPGs are descendants of traditional strategy games such as chess 22 and table top role playing and strategic war games such as Chainmail which were mainly tactical in their original form 142 143 The format of a tactical C RPG is also like a traditional RPG in its appearance pacing and rule structure Like standard RPGs the player controls a finite party and battles a similar number of enemies 141 And like other RPGs death is usually temporary albeit some have permanent death of party members But this genre incorporates strategic gameplay such as tactical movement on an isometric grid 141 Tactical RPGs tend not to feature multiplayer play A number of early Western role playing video games used a highly tactical form of combat including parts of the Ultima series which introduced party based tiled combat in Ultima III Exodus 1983 144 Ultima III would go on to be ported to many other platforms and influence the development of later titles 145 as would Boko suk a Wars 1983 considered a pioneer in the strategy simulation RPG genre according to Nintendo 146 Conventionally however the term tactical RPG known as simulation RPG in Japan refers to the distinct subgenre that was born in Japan as the early origins of tactical RPGs are difficult to trace from the American side of the Pacific where much of the early RPG genre developed 142 Many tactical RPGs can be both extremely time consuming and extremely difficult Hence the appeal of most tactical RPGs is to the hardcore not casual computer and video game player 147 Traditionally tactical RPGs have been quite popular in Japan but have not enjoyed the same degree of success in North America and elsewhere 148 149 However the audience for Japanese tactical RPGs has grown substantially since the mid 90 s with PS 1 and PS 2 titles such as Final Fantasy Tactics Suikoden Tactics Vanguard Bandits and Disgaea enjoying a surprising measure of popularity as well as hand held war games like Fire Emblem 150 Final Fantasy Tactics for the PS 1 is often considered the breakthrough title outside Japan 151 152 Older T RPGs are also being re released via software emulation such as on the Wii Virtual Console and on handheld game consoles giving games a new lease on life and exposure to new audiences 153 Japanese video games such as these are as a result no longer nearly as rare a commodity in North America as they were during the 1990 s citation needed Western video games have utilized similar mechanics for years as well and were largely defined by X COM UFO Defense 1994 in much the same way as Eastern video games were by Fire Emblem 154 Titles such as X COM have generally allowed greater freedom of movement when interacting with the surrounding environment than their Eastern counterparts 155 156 Other similar examples include the Jagged Alliance 157 158 1994 2013 and Silent Storm 158 159 2003 2005 series According to a few developers it became increasingly difficult during the 2000 s to develop games of this type for the PC in the West though several had been developed in Eastern Europe with mixed results 160 161 and even some Japanese console RPG developers began to complain about a bias against turn based systems 97 98 Reasons cited include Western publishers ' focus on developing real time and action oriented games instead 161 Lastly there are a number of full fledged C RPGs which could be described as having tactical combat Examples from the classic era of C RPGs include parts of the aforementioned Ultima series 162 SSI's Wizard's Crown 1985 and The Eternal Dagger 1987 31 the Gold Box games of the late ' 80 s and early ' 90 s many of which were later ported to Japanese video game systems 30 and the Realms of Ark ania 1992 1996 series based on the German The Dark Eye pen and paper system 31 More recent examples include Wasteland 2 163 Shadow run Dragon fall 164 and Divinity Original S in 165 all released in 2014 Partly due to the release of these games 2014 has been called the first year of the C RPG renaissance 166 Turn based RPGs have actions take place in a sequence which can be determined by various factors Unlike other genres actions by others characters cannot be performed unless it is their turn to perform them This can be limited to just battles in games or even movement around the over world depending on the game mechanic or subgenre 167 This genre started off on PC with series like Ultima and then become very popular on console with releases like Dragon Quest A steadily increasing number of other non RP video games have adopted aspects traditionally seen in RPGs such as experience point systems equipment management and choices in dialogue as developers push to fill the demand for role playing elements in non RPGs 66 168 The blending of these elements with a number of different game engines and gameplay styles have created a myriad of hybrid game categories formed by mixing popular gameplay elements featured in other genres such as first person shooters platformers and turn based and real time strategy games Examples include first person shooters such as parts of the Deus Ex starting in 2000 and S T A L K E R starting in 2007 series 169 170 171 172 real time strategy games such as Spell Force The Order of Dawn 2003 and Warhammer 40 000 Dawn of War II 2009 173 174 puzzle video games such as Castlevania Puzzle 2010 and Puzzle Quest Challenge of the Warlords 2007 175 176 and turn based strategy games like the Steel Panthers 1995 2006 series which combined tactical military combat with RPG derived unit advancement As a group hybrid games have been both praised and criticized being referred to by one critic as the poor man's RPG for omitting the dialogue choices and story driven character development of major AAA titles 168 and by another critic as promising for shedding the conventions of more established franchises in an attempt to innovate 177 RPGs seldom test a player's physical skill Combat is typically a tactical challenge rather than a physical one and games involve other non action gameplay such as choosing dialog options inventory management or buying and selling items 178 Although RPGs share some combat rules with wargames RPGs are often about a small group of individual characters 61 Wargames tend to have large groups of identical units as well as non humanoid units such as tanks and airplanes Role playing games do not normally allow the player to produce more units However the Heroes of Might and Magic series crosses these genres by combining individual heroes with large numbers of troops in large battles 4 RPGs rival adventure games in terms of their rich storylines in contrast to genres that do not rely upon storytelling such as sports games or puzzle games 4 Both genres also feature highly detailed characters and a great deal of exploration However RPGs also feature a combat system which adventure games lack In doing so RPGs tend to emphasize complex internal mechanics where characters are defined by increasing numerical attributes Gameplay elements strongly associated with this genre such as statistical character development have been widely adapted to other video game genres For example Grand Theft Auto San Andreas an action adventure game uses resource statistics abbreviated as stats to define a wide range of attributes including stamina weapon proficiency driving lung capacity and muscle tone and uses numerous cutscenes and quests to advance the story Warcraft III Reign of Chaos a real time strategy game features heroes that can complete quests obtain new equipment and learn new abilities as they advance in level 179 A community created mod based on Warcraft III Defense of the Ancients DotA served as significant inspiration for the multiplayer online battle arena MOB A genre 180 181 Due to its Warcraft III origins MOB A is a fusion of role playing games real time strategy games and action games with RPG elements built in its core gameplay A key features such as control over one character in a party growth in power over the course of match learning new thematic abilities using of man a 182 leveling and accumulation of experience points 183 equipment and inventory management 184 completing quests 185 and fighting with the stationary boss monsters 186 187 have resemblance with role playing games According to Satoru Iwata former president of Nintendo turn based RPGs have been unfairly criticized as being outdated and action based RPGs can frustrate players who are unable to keep up with the battles 39 According to Yuji Horii creator of the popular Dragon Quest series and Ryu taro Ichimura producer of Square Enix turn based RPGs allow the player time to make decisions without feeling rushed or worry about real life distractions 39 The best selling RPG series worldwide is Pok mon 55 which has sold over 300 million units 188 189 190 191 with over 30 million sales for Pok mon Red Blue and Green alone 192 The second and third best selling RPG franchises worldwide are Square Enix's Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest series with over 110 million units and over 64 million units sold as of March 31 2014 respectively 193 194 195 Nearly

than four million copies 196 Square Enix's best selling title is Final Fantasy VII which has sold over 10 million copies worldwide as of 2010 197 Among the best selling PC RPGs overall is the massively multiplayer online game World of Warcraft with 11 5 million subscribers as of May 2010 198 Among single player PC RPGs Diablo II has sold the largest amount citation needed with the most recently cited number being over 4 million copies as of 2001 199 However copies of the Diablo Battle Chest continued to be sold in retail stores with the compilation appearing on the NPD Group's top 10 PC games sales list as recently as 2010 200 Further Diablo Battle Chest was the 19 th best selling PC game of 2008 a full seven years after the game's initial release 201 and 11 million users still
