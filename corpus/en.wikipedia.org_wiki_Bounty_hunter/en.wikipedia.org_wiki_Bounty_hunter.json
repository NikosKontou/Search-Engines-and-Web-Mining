    "transformers_text": "A bounty hunter in the United States is a private agent working for a bail bondsman who captures fugitives or criminals for a commission or bounty The occupation officially known as a bail enforcement agent or fugitive recovery agent has traditionally operated outside the legal constraints that govern police officers and other agents of the state This is because a bail agreement between a defendant and a bail bondsman is essentially a civil contract that is incumbent upon the bondsman to enforce Since they are not police officers bounty hunters are exposed to legal liabilities from which agents of the state are protected as these i mm unities enable police to perform their functions effectively without fear of lawsuits Bounty hunters are typically independent contractors paid a commission of the total bail amount that is owed by the fugitive and co signer they provide their own professional liability insurance and only get paid if they are able to find the skip and bring them in Bounty hunting is a vestige of common law which was created during the Middle Ages In the United States bounty hunters primarily draw their legal imprimatur from an 1872 Supreme Court decision Taylor v Taint or The practice historically existed in many parts of the world however as of the 21 st century it is found almost exclusively in the United States as the practice is illegal under the laws of most other countries State laws vary widely as to the legality of the practice Illinois Kentucky Oregon and Wisconsin have outlawed commercial bail bonds while Wyoming offers few regulations governing the practice 1 In 1873 the Supreme Court noted that bounty hunters were a part of the U S law enforcement system with a decision in Taylor v Taint or 2 When the bail is given the principal is regarded as delivered to the custody of his sureties Their domain is a continuance of the original imprisonment Whenever they choose to do so they may seize him and deliver him up to his discharge and if it cannot be done at once they may imprison him until it can be done They may exercise their rights in person or by agent They may pursue him into another state may arrest him on the Sabbath and if necessary may break and enter his house for that purpose The seizure is not made by virtue of due process None is needed It is likened to the arrest by the sheriff of an escaped prisoner Bounty hunters at the time were used to catch wanted criminals and children who ran away from the American Indian boarding schools citation needed In modern times bounty hunters carry out arrests mostly of those who have skipped bail or whose bail has been revoked but are often referred to as and typically prefer to be identified by more formal titles such as bail enforcement agents or fugitive recovery agents 3 4 When undertaking arrest warrants agents may wear bullet resistant vests badges and other clothing bearing the inscription bail enforcement agent or similar titles 5 Many agents arm themselves with firearms or sometimes with less lethal weapons such as tasers 5 batons tear gas CS gas pepper spray 5 or pepper spray projectiles The National Association of Fugitive Recovery Agents is the professional association representing this industry 6 Bounty hunters in the United States are employed by bail bondsmen The bounty hunter is usually paid about 10 of the total bail amount but this commission can vary on an individual case by case basis usually depending upon the difficulty level of the assignment and the approach used to exonerate the bail bond If the fugitive eludes bail the bondsman not the bounty hunter is responsible for 100 of the total bail amount This is a way of ensuring clients arrive at trial As of 2003 bounty hunters claimed to catch 31 500 bail jumpers per year about 90 of people who jump bail 7 Bounty hunters have varying levels of authority in their duties with regard to their targets depending on which states they operate in Barring restrictions applicable state by state a bounty hunter may enter the fugitive's legal residence without any warrant besides the original bail bonds contract signed by the fugitive to execute a re arrest In some states bounty hunters do not undergo any formal training 8 and are generally unlicensed only requiring sanction from a bail bondsman to operate In other states however they are held to varying standards of training and license State legal requirements are often imposed on out of state bounty hunters so a fugitive could temporarily escape re arrest by entering a state in which the bail agent has limited or no jurisdiction citation needed In the United States legal system the 1873 U S Supreme Court case Taylor v Taint or 16 Wall 83 U S 366 21 L Ed 287 is cited as having established that the person into whose custody an accused is remanded as part of the accuser's bail has sweeping rights to that person 9 Though this may have been accurate at the time the decision was reached the portion cited was o biter dictum and has no binding precedent i al value 10 As of 2008 four states Illinois Kentucky Oregon and Wisconsin prohibit the practice as they have abolished commercial bail bonds and banned the commercial bail bonds industry within their borders 11 As of 2012 Nebraska and Maine similarly prohibit surety bail bonds 12 The states of Texas and California require a license to engage in bounty hunting while other states may have no restrictions 13 There have been some states that have rolled out specific laws that govern bounty hunting For example Minnesota laws provide that a bounty hunter cannot drive a white black maroon or dark green vehicle or wear any colors that are reserved for the police in the state e g maroon which is worn by the Minnesota Highway Patrol 14 The State of Connecticut has a detailed licensing process which requires any person who wants to engage in the business as a bail enforcement agent bounty hunter to first obtain a professional license from the Commissioner of Public Safety specifically detailing that No person shall as surety on a bond in a criminal proceeding or as an agent of such surety engage in the business of taking or attempting to take into custody the principal on the bond who has failed to appear in court and for whom a re arrest warrant or cap i as has been issued unless such person is licensed as a bail enforcement agent Connecticut has strict standards which require bail enforcement agents to pass an extensive background check and while engaging in fugitive recovery operations wear a uniform notify the local police barrack wear a badge and only carry licensed and approved firearms including handguns and long guns which are permitted Recently the Connecticut State Police converted its bail enforcement agent licensing unit to reflect the role bail enforcement agents play in the Connecticut criminal justice system placing them in the newly defined Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection 15 Several schools in Connecticut have obtained certification by the Connecticut State Police to pre license bail enforcement agents in a minimum of 20 hours of criminal justice training and a minimum of eight hours of firearms training Some of the more advanced schools offer specialized training in the area of tactical firearms to prepare BE As for conducting dangerous recovery operations 16 In Florida only a limited surety agent licensed by the Florida Department of Financial Services ' Bureau of Agent and Agency Licensing may legally apprehend bail fugitives in addition to law enforcement's ability to arrest a fugitive pursuant to a bench warrant 17 According to the Chapter 648 of Florida Statute regarding Bail Bond Agents A person may not represent himself or herself to be a bail enforcement agent bounty hunter or other similar title in this state 18 Louisiana requires bounty hunters to wear clothing identifying them as such 19 A Nevada bounty hunter is referred to as a bail enforcement agent or bail enforcement solicitor In order to meet state requirements the bail agent must complete a minimum 80 hours of training or a POST certification and pass the required examinations and obtain a bail enforcement agent license by the Nevada Division of Insurance within nine months of employment 20 21 To acquire such license one must be at least 21 years old a United States citizen have a high school diploma or equivalent and undergo the required training and pass a state examination 22 citation needed A Texas bounty hunter is required to be a peace officer Level III armed security officer or a private investigator 23 24 better source needed International extradition exists only by authority of an international treaty with the nation where the fugitive is located Extradition treaties limit extradition to certain offenses and not all fugitives can be extradited Generally the crime being charged against the fugitive must be recognized as a crime in the jurisdiction from which extradition is being sought Bail fugitive recovery agents may run into serious legal problems if they try to apprehend fugitives outside the United States where they have no legal authority to arrest and taking a person into custody could be charged as kidnapping or some other serious crime While the United States government and most states recognize a bail agent or fugitive recovery agent's powers of arrest the governments in other countries including sovereign Native American territories within the United States do not recognize a bail agent's or fugitive recovery agent's powers of arrest Bounty hunter Duane Dog Chapman star of the TV series Dog the Bounty Hunter was arrested in Mexico after he apprehended the multi millionaire rapist and fugitive Andrew Luster Chapman was subsequently released 7 but was later declared a fugitive by a Mexican prosecutor and was subsequently arrested in the United States to be extradited back to Mexico All charges were later dropped due to the crime passing the statute of limitations date Chapman has maintained that under Mexico's citizen arrest law he and his crew acted under proper policy citation needed Daniel K ear of Fairfax Virginia pursued and abducted Sidney Jaffe at a residence in Canada and returned him to Florida to face trial K ear was extradited to Canada in 1983 and convicted of kidnapping 25 26 Several bounty hunters have been arrested for killing a fugitive or apprehending the wrong individuals 27 Unlike police officers they have no legal protections against injuries to non fugitives and few legal protections against injuries to their targets citation needed In a Texas case bounty hunters Richard James and his partner D G Pearson were arrested in 2001 for felony charges during an arrest The charges were levied by the fugitive and his family but were later dismissed against the hunters after the fugitive's wife shot a deputy sheriff in another arrest attempt of the fugitive by the county sheriff's department The hunters sued the fugitive and family winning the civil suit for malicious prosecution with a judgment amount of 1 5 million citation needed",
