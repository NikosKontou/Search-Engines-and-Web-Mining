    "transformers_text": "Gy n and ro morphism is the phenomenon that occurs when an individual organism possesses both male and female phenotypes due to genetic chimera of sex chromosomes in cells across the body and is most easily recognized in species that display sexual dimorphism 1 An individual who displays this characteristic is called a gy n and ro morph The term comes from the Greek gy n ' female ' an r ' male ' and morph ' form ' and is most commonly documented the field of entomology 1 Gy n and ro morphism is distinct from both intersexuality and hermaphroditism although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably 2 Gy n and ro morphism has been noted in Lepidoptera butterflies and moths since the 1700 s 3 4 5 It has also been observed in crustaceans such as lobsters and crabs in spiders 6 ticks 7 flies 8 locusts 9 crickets 10 dragonflies 11 ants 12 13 termites 14 bees 15 lizards 16 snakes 17 rodents 18 19 and birds 20 21 22 23 24 25 Although it can be seen in a variety of species gy n and ro morphism is notably uncommon 26 Reporting depends on ease of detecting the phenomenon whether a species displays noticeable sexual dimorphism and how well studied a region or organism is For example up until 2023 gy n and ro morphism had been reported in more than 40 bird species but the vast majority of these are from the Palearctic and Nearctic meanwhile incidents in species from other regions may go under reported due to lack of data collection 27 Several patterns of tissue distribution occur amongst observed gy n and ro morphs Patch like patterns may arise but commonly the phenotype presents in a symmetrical pattern of which there are three main types bilateral oblique and transverse 2 Bilateral describes an organism that is split laterally with one side possessing female characteristics and the other having male characteristics Oblique refers to a diagonal line across the sagittal plane that separates the male and female phenotypes Lastly transverse is a separation of male and female phenotypes along an axis that intersects with what would be considered the primary axis for the body of a given organism 2 A notable example in birds is the zebra finch These birds have later aliz ed brain structures in the face of a common steroid signal providing strong evidence for a non hormonal primary sex mechanism regulating brain differentiation 28 The exact cause for gy n and ro morphism is unknown and appears to vary by species 1 One proposed cause for the phenotype in birds is a disruption that occurs in meiosis in female birds who possess ZW chromosomes in which polar bodies are not forced out of the cell 29 This is then followed with fertilization by two Z bearing sperm cells which creates cells in the embryo containing both ZZ and ZW chromosomes 29 The same phenomenon can be seen in other species such as Drosophila melanogaster and creates a genetic mosaic which gives rise to the mixed phenotype Gy n and ro morphs occasionally afford a powerful tool in genetic developmental and behavioral analyses In Drosophila melanogaster for instance they provided evidence that male courtship behavior originates in the brain 30 that males can distinguish con specific females from males by the scent or some other characteristic of the posterior dorsal integument of females 31 32 that the germ cells originate in the posterior most region of the blast oder m 33 and that somatic components of the gonads originate in the mesoderm al region of the fourth and fifth abdominal segment 34",
