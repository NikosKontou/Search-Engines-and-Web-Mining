    "transformers_text": "Nick Magazine is a defunct American children's magazine inspired by the children's television network Nickelodeon . Its first incarnation appeared in 1990 and was distributed at participating Pizza Hut restaurants; the version of the magazine only saw two issues. The magazine returned in Summer 1993 with all types of content, primarily humor and comics. Originally published on a quarterly basis, it switched to bi-monthly with the February/March 1994 issue. It then went to ten times per year starting in March 1995, with a bi-annual December/January and June/July issue until its end in 2009.\n\nFor most of its run, the magazine's editor-in-chief was Laura Galen. She wrote the goodbye message for the 159th and final issue in 2009.\n\nOn February 5, 2015, Papercutz announced that they worked a deal with Nickelodeon to create a new version of the magazine. [ 2 ] The first issue was released in June 2015, and the final issue was released in 2016.\n\nIn spite of being related to the network it was named after, Nickelodeon Magazine covered many sorts of topics, not just what was on the network. The magazine contained informative non-fiction pieces, humor, interviews, comics, pranks and recipes (such as green slime cake ). The magazine's mascot was Zelda Van Gutters, a Lakeland Terrier dog who appeared throughout the magazine with sarcastic asides on the articles. She was also the star of the magazine's semi-regular photo comic strip \"Ruffing It\".\n\nOther contributors included Dan Abdo, John Accurso, Bill Alger, Graham Annable , Ian Baker, Tom Bunk , Martin Cendreda, Greg Cook , Dave Cooper , Jordan Crane , Mark Crilley , Scott Cunningham, Vincent Deporter , Stephen DeStefano , Evan Dorkin , Brent Engstrom, Feggo (Felipe Galindo), Gary Fields, Emily Flake , Ellen Forney , Francho (Arnoldo Franchioni), Dave Fremont, Tom Gauld , Justin Green , Tim Hamilton, Charise Maricle Harper, Paul Karasik , John Kerschbaum, Jacob Lambert, Roger Langridge , Chris Lanier, Robert Leighton , Alec Longstreth , Jason Lutes , Pat Moriarity, Dan Moynihan, Nate Neal, Mark Newgarden , Travis Nichols, Marc Tyler Nobleman , Roger Ochoa, Lark Pien , Johnny Ryan , P.Shaw!, Karen Sneider, Israel Sanchez, Jason Shiga , R. Sikoryak , Jen Sorensen , Art Spiegelman , Jay Stephens , Wayno, Todd Webb, Drew Weing , Steve Weissman , Kurt Wolfgang and Gahan Wilson .\n\nIn addition, Nick Magazine' s comic books also featured comics from characters of the network's programming, which normally appeared just before a season premiere or special film event for the property on the actual series. Among the shows featured in the comic book were:\n\nNickelodeon Comics , formally titled Nickelodeon Magazine Presents , was a series of one-shot special issues put out by Nickelodeon Magazine . Each issue tied in with comics. Nickelodeon Comics mainly contained comics, either newly made stories or two-page shorts reprinted from Nick Magazine , but also featured articles, puzzles, and poster inserts.\n\nOther comics, appearing in both Nickelodeon Magazine's comics section and in the one-shot specials, included:\n\nA British version of the magazine was published from 16 February 2011 as a collaboration between Nickelodeon and D. C. Thomson & Co. It seems to have been discontinued as of June 2012.\n\nViacom ended operations of the magazine in June 2009 (though the last issue was published in December of that year) due to economic conditions and the continual move of the network's content to their website . [ 3 ] The title continued to publish until the December/January 2010 issue, and the final issue featured an editorial from magazine SVP/Editorial Director Laura Galen thanking the magazine's readers. On February 5, 2015, Papercutz announced that they have worked a deal with Nickelodeon to revive the magazine. The new version was released in June 2015 and ended in 2016.
