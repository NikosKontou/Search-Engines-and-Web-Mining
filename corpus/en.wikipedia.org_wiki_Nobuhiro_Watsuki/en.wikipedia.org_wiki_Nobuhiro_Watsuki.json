Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story features Him ura Kenshin stopping a crime lord from taking over the Kami ya family dojo The second sees Kenshin saving a young girl who is being held ransom by fallen samurai 6 These three works served as the basis for his first serial Rur o uni Kenshin Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story which follows the former hito kiri Him ura Kenshin and was serialized in Weekly Sh nen Jump from 1994 to 1999 It was a major success with over 70 million copies in circulation 7 and was adapted into an anime television series several animated films and a trilogy of live action films

conclusion of Rur o uni Kenshin My j in Yah i ko must save the daughter of a dojo master from an old foe During Rur o uni Kenshin's serialization Wat suki wrote Meteor Strike a one shot written for a Weekly Sh nen Jump artists project It chronicles the what if adventures of a young boy who is struck in the head by a meteor and gains superhuman powers eventually saving his town from a nuclear disaster Wat suki felt disgusted with the work and originally did not plan on revealing it but ultimately decided to include Meteor Strike in the final Rur o uni Kenshin volume to increase its page count Although he said that after reading the story over again it relaxed him in a nice way 8 Wat suki included three main elements in the story which he described as having some different flavors than Rur o uni Kenshin He had wanted to use meteors in a story for a long time since they are the most energetic natural phenomena His second element was a boy wearing a pair of white gloves Wat suki described white gloves as sort of plain and not cool at all yet he considers the element to be one of his favorites since the gloves give off a sense of strength His third element is the girl wearing a construction site helmet The helmet is masculine while the Japanese school uniform that the girl wears is feminine 8 Wat suki said that he created the main character Shinya on the spot giving him too much honesty and a personality that overlaps with that of Him ura Kenshin which he regrets a little Wat suki created Chi ho the other major character to show the sho jo theme of the moment when the boy out matures the girl Wat suki felt that the plan didn't work out so well and a lot wasn't what I wanted it to be He added that he liked portraying the helpful nature of Chi ho 8 In 2001 Wat
