    "transformers_text": "The Independent is a British online newspaper It was established in 1986 as a national morning printed paper Nicknamed the Indy it began as a broadsheet and changed to tabloid format in 2003 4 The last printed edition was published on Saturday 26 March 2016 leaving only the online edition 5 The Independent won the Brand of the Year Award in The Drum Awards for Online Media 2023 6 Launched in 1986 the first issue of The Independent was published on 7 October in broadsheet format 7 8 It was produced by Newspaper Publishing plc and created by Andreas Whit tam Smith Stephen Glover and Matthew Symonds All three partners were former journalists at The Daily Telegraph who had left the paper towards the end of Lord Hartwell's ownership Marcus Sie ff was the first chairman of Newspaper Publishing and Whit tam Smith took control of the paper 9 The paper was created at a time of a fundamental change in British newspaper publishing Rupert Murdoch was challenging long accepted practices of the print unions and ultimately defeated them in the Wapping dispute Consequently production costs could be reduced which created openings for more competition As a result of controversy around Murdoch's move to Wapping the plant was effectively having to function under siege from sacked print workers picketing outside The Independent attracted some of the staff from the two Murdoch broadsheets who had chosen not to move to his company's new headquarters Launched with the advertising slogan It is Are you and challenging both The Guardian for centre left readers and The Times as the newspaper of record The Independent reached a circulation of more than 400 000 by 1989 citation needed Competing in a moribund market The Independent sparked a general freshening of newspaper design as well as within a few years a price war in the market sector When The Independent launched The Independent on Sunday in 1990 sales were less than anticipated partly due to the launch of the Sunday Correspondent four months prior although this direct rival closed at the end of November 1990 Some aspects of production merged with the main paper although the Sunday paper retained a largely distinct editorial staff In the 1990 s The Independent was faced with price cutting by the Murdoch titles and started an advertising campaign accusing The Times and The Daily Telegraph of reflecting the views of their proprietors Rupert Murdoch and Conrad Black It featured spoofs of the other papers ' mastheads with the words The Rupert Murdoch or The Conrad Black with The Independent below the main title citation needed Newspaper Publishing had financial problems A number of other media companies were interested in the paper Tony O ' Reilly's media group and Mirror Group Newspapers MG N had bought a stake of about a third each by mid 1994 In March 1995 Newspaper Publishing was restructured with a rights issue splitting the shareholding into O ' Reilly's Independent News Media 43 MG N 43 and Pris a publisher of El Pa s 12 10 In April 1996 there was another refinancing and in March 1998 O ' Reilly bought the other shares of the company for 30 million and assumed the company's debt Brendan Hopkins headed Independent News Andrew Marr was appointed editor of The Independent and Rosie Boycott became editor of The Independent on Sunday Marr introduced a dramatic if short lived redesign which won critical favour but was a commercial failure partly as a result of a limited promotional budget Marr admitted his changes had been a mistake in his book My Trade 11 Boycott left in April 1998 to join the Daily Express and Marr left in May 1998 later becoming the BBC's political editor Simon Ke lner was appointed as the editor By this time the circulation had fallen below 200 000 Independent News spent heavily to increase circulation and the paper went through several redesigns While circulation increased it did not approach the level which had been achieved in 1989 or restore profitability Job cuts and financial controls reduced the morale of journalists and the quality of the product 12 Ivan Fallon on the board since 1995 and formerly a key figure at The Sunday Times replaced Hopkins as head of Independent News Media in July 2002 By mid 2004 the newspaper was losing 5 million per year A gradual improvement meant that by 2006 circulation was at a nine year high 12 In November 2008 following further staff cuts production was moved to Northcliffe House in Kensington High Street the headquarters of Associated Newspapers 13 The two newspaper groups ' editorial management and commercial operations remained separate but they shared services including security information technology switchboard and payroll citation needed On 25 March 2010 Independent News Media sold the newspaper to a new company owned by the family of Russian oligarch Alexander Le be dev for a nominal 1 fee and 9 25 million over the next 10 months choosing this option over closing The Independent and The Independent on Sunday which would have cost 28 million and 40 million respectively due to long term contracts Alexander's son Evgeny became chairman of the new company with Alexander becoming a board director 14 15 In 2009 Le be dev had bought a controlling stake in the London Evening Standard Two weeks later editor Roger Alton resigned 16 In July 2011 The Independent's columnist Johann Hari was stripped of the Orwell Prize he had won in 2008 after claims to which Hari later admitted 17 of plagiarism and inaccuracy 18 In January 2012 Chris Black hurst editor of The Independent told the Le ves on inquiry that the scandal had severely damaged the newspaper's reputation He nevertheless told the inquiry that Hari would return as a columnist in four to five weeks 19 Hari later announced that he would not return to The Independent 20 Jonathan Foreman contrasted The Independent's reaction to the scandal unfavorably with the reaction of American newspapers to similar incidents such as the Jays on Blair case which led to resignations of editors deep soul searching and new standards of exactitude being imposed 21 The historian Guy Walters suggested that Hari's fabrications had been an open secret among the newspaper's staff and that their internal inquiry was a face saving exercise 22 The Independent and The Independent on Sunday endorsed Remain in the Br exit referendum 23 of 2016 In March 2016 The Independent closed its print edition to become a pure play digital media company The last printed edition was published on Saturday 26 March 2016 The Independent on Sunday published its last edition on 20 March 2016 and was closed 8 24 In 2017 Sultan Muhammad Abul jada yel bought a 30 stake in The Independent 25 Geordie Gre ig was appointed The Independent's Editor in Chief in January 2023 He oversaw a period of editorial investment 26 Later that year Chief Executive of ID N ML Zach Leonard moved to the United States as Global COO and President North America 27 and former Editor Christian Broughton was appointed Chief Executive Louise Thomas was appointed US Editor in March 2024 28 In 2019 The Independent entered a long term partnership with the Saudi Research Media Group who operate under licence the Independent Arabia Independent Turkish Independent Persian and Independent Urdu language editions 29 30 In September 2020 The Independent launched Independent en Espa ol a wholly owned and operated Spanish language edition The Independent began publishing as a broadsheet in a series of celebrated designs The final version was designed by Carroll Dempsey and Th irk ell following a commission by Nicholas Garland who along with Alexander Chancellor was unhappy with designs produced by Raymond Hawke y and Michael McGuiness on seeing the proposed designs Chancellor had said I thought we were joining a serious paper The first edition was designed and implemented by Michael Crozier who was Executive Editor Design and Picture from pre launch in 1986 to 1994 31 From September 2003 the paper was produced in both broadsheet and tabloid sized versions with the same content in each The tabloid edition was termed compact to distance itself from the more sensationalist reporting style usually associated with tabloid newspapers in the UK 32 preferring to remain focused on hard news similarly to the tabloid size edition of The Times 33 After launching in the London area and then in North West England 34 the smaller format appeared gradually throughout the UK Soon afterwards Rupert Murdoch's Times followed suit introducing its own tabloid sized version 35 Prior to these changes The Independent had a daily circulation of around 217 500 citation needed the lowest of any major national British daily a figure that climbed by 15 as of March 2004 to 250 000 citation needed Throughout much of 2006 circulation stagnated at a quarter of a million On 14 May 2004 The Independent produced its last weekday broadsheet having stopped producing a Saturday broadsheet edition in January citation needed The Independent on Sunday published its last simultaneous broadsheet on 9 October 2005 and thereafter followed a compact design until the print edition was discontinued citation needed On 12 April 2005 The Independent redesigned its layout to a more European feel similar to France's Lib ration The redesign was carried out by a Barcelona based design studio The weekday second section was subsumed within the main paper double page feature articles became common in the main news sections and there were revisions to the front and back covers 36 A new second section Extra was introduced on 25 April 2006 It is similar to The Guardian's G 2 and The Times's Times 2 containing features reportage and games including sudoku In June 2007 The Independent on Sunday consolidated its content into a news section which included sports and business and a magazine focusing on life and culture 37 On 23 September 2008 the main newspaper became full color and Extra was replaced by an Independent Life Supplement focusing on different themes each day 38 Three weeks after the acquisition of the paper by Alexander Le be dev and Evgeny Le be devin 2010 the paper was relaunched with another redesign on 20 April The new format featured smaller headlines and a new pullout Views paper section which contained the paper's comment and feature articles 39 Following the 2003 switch in format The Independent became known for its unorthodox and campaigning front pages which frequently relied on images graphics or lists rather than traditional headlines and written news content For example following the Kashmir earthquake in 2005 it used its front page to urge its readers to donate to its appeal fund and following the publication of the Hutton Report into the death of British government scientist David Kelly its front page simply carried the word Whitewash 40 In 2003 the paper's editor Simon Ke lner was named Editor of the Year at the What the Papers Say awards partly in recognition of according to the judges his often arresting and imaginative front page designs 41 In 2008 as he was stepping down as editor he stated that it was possible to overdo the formula and that the style of the paper's front pages perhaps needed reinvention 42 Under the subsequent editorship of Chris Black hurst the campaigning poster style front pages were scaled back in favour of more conventional news stories 43 The weekday Saturday and Sunday editions of The Independent all included supplements and pull out subsections Daily Monday to Friday The Independent Saturday's The Independent The Independent on Sunday The Independent's original website launched in 1996 On 23 January 2008 The Independent relaunched its online edition 46 47 The relaunched site introduced a new look better access to the blog service priority on image and video content and additional areas of the site including art architecture fashion gadgets and health The paper launched podcast programmes such as The Independent Music Radio Show The Independent Travel Guides The Independent Sailing Podcasts and The Independent Video Travel Guides From 2009 the website started carrying short video news bulletins provided by the Al Jazeera English news channel 48 Over the years this developed to the point that the website regularly featured video content in its news reports Some of this was syndicated and sourced from other news channels and providers but The Independent gradually increased numbers in its own video team In addition to putting together short form video news reports the website soon began producing its own video and podcast series including explain ers short documentary ' on the ground ' style reports and lifestyle and culture videos including since 2017 the award nominated series Millennial Love later rebranded Love Lives citation needed In 2014 The Independent launched a sister website i 100 a share able journalism site with similarities to Reddit and Up worthy 49 It was rebranded in 2016 as Indy 100 In late 2020 The Independent launched Independent TV which saw the title's video offering provided on many formats including on the web browser in the app and on Smart TV 50 In March 2023 The Independent released The Body in the Woods a feature length documentary by its Chief International Correspondent Bel Tre w 51 The Independent is generally described as centrist 52 centre left 53 54 liberal 3 and liberal left 55 When the paper was established in 1986 the founders intended its political stance to reflect the centre of the British political spectrum and thought that it would attract readers primarily from The Times and The Daily Telegraph It has been seen as leaning to the left wing of the political spectrum making it more a competitor to The Guardian however The Independent tends to take a liberal pro market stance on economic issues 56 The Independent on Sunday referred to itself as a proudly liberal newspaper 57 The paper has highlighted what it refers to as war crimes being committed by pro government forces in the Darfur region of Sudan 58 The paper has been a strong supporter of electoral reform 59 In 1997 The Independent on Sunday launched a campaign for the de criminal is ation of cannabis Ten years later it reversed itself arguing that skunk the cannabis strain smoked by the majority of young Britons in 2007 had become 25 times stronger than resins old a decade ago 60 The paper's opinion on the British monarchy has sometimes been described as republican 61 though it officially identifies as reformist wishing for a reformed monarchy that reflects the nation over which it reigns and which is accountable to the people for its activities 62 Originally it avoided royal stories Whit tam Smith later saying he thought the British press was unduly besotted with the Royal Family and that a newspaper could manage without stories about the monarchy 63 In 2007 Alan Rus bridger editor of The Guardian said of The Independent The emphasis on views not news means that the reporting is rather thin and it loses impact on the front page the more you do that 64 In a 12 June 2007 speech British Prime Minister Tony Blair called The Independent a views paper saying it was started as an antidote to the idea of journalism as views not news That was why it was called the Independent Today it is avowedly a views paper not merely a newspaper 65 The Independent criticised Blair's comments the following day 66 67 it later changed format to include a Views paper insert in the centre of the regular newspaper designed to feature most of the opinion columns and arts reviews A leader published on the day of the 2008 London mayoral election compared the candidates and said that if the newspaper had a vote it would vote first for the Green Party candidate Si n Berry noting the similarity between her priorities and those of The Independent and secondly with rather heavy heart for the incumbent Ken Livingstone 68 An Ip sos MORI poll estimated that in the 2010 United Kingdom general election 44 of regular readers voted Liberal Democrat 32 voted Labour 69 and 14 voted Conservative compared to 23 29 and 36 respectively of the overall electorate 70 On the eve of the 2010 general election The Independent supported the Liberal Democrats arguing that they are longstanding and convincing champions of civil liberties sound economics international co operation on the great global challenges and of course fundamental electoral reform These are all principles that this newspaper has long held dear 59 However before the 2015 United Kingdom general election The Independent on Sunday desisted from advising its readers how to vote writing that this does not mean that we are a bloodless value free news sheet We have always been committed to social justice but the paper recognised that it was up the readers to make up their own mind about whether you agree with us or not Rather than support a particular party the paper urged all its reader to vote as a responsibility of common citizenship 71 On 4 May 2015 the weekday version of The Independent said that a continuation of the Conservative Liberal Democrat coalition after the general election would be a positive outcome 72 At the end of July 2018 The Independent led a campaign they called the Final Say a change org petition by former editor Christian Broughton for a binding referendum on the Br exit deal between the UK and the European Union 73 As of October 2018 Independent Arabia was launched It is published under licence and owned and managed by Saudi Research and Media Group SRM G a major publishing organisation with close ties to the Saudi royal family 74 needs update In the 2024 United Kingdom general election The Independent endorsed the Labour Party although added what it termed as a warning that Labour must turn its promises into policies that benefit the hardworking and hopeful people of this country 75 The Independent The Independent on Sunday There have also been various guest editors over the years such as Elton John on 1 December 2010 The Body Shop's Anita Roddick on 19 June 2003 and U 2's Bono in 2006 80 81 82 The Independent sponsors the Longford Prize meant to recognise those who have helped the lives of current or former

announced by The Independent in February 2016 to be written by journalists but with stories selected by ' up votes ' from readers 87 The Independent supported U 2 lead singer Bono's Product RED brand by creating The RED Independent an occasional edition that gave half the day's proceeds to the charity 88 The first edition was in May 2006 Edited by Bono it drew high sales 89 A September 2006 edition of The RED Independent designed by fashion designer Giorgio Armani drew controversy due to its cover shot showing model Kate Moss in blackface for an article about AIDS in Africa 90 The Pride List was initially labelled as The Pink List published by the Independent on Sunday on 6 August 2000 It contained a list of the 48 most prominent LGBT people in the UK This was resurrected as the
