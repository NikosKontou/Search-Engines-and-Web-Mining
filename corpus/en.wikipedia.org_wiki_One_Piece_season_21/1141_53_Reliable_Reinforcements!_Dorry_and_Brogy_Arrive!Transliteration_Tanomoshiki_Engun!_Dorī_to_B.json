Zoro battles Lucci, refusing to be manipulated into surrendering. The Marines falter as their ships are destroyed, forcing Vice Admiral Red King to change tactics. Bonney tearfully tells Luffy she has been searching those years for him, calls him Nika, and asks him to teach her to fight, leaving him confused. Luffy strikes Saturn with aGum-Gum Dawn Gatling, while Sanji deflects Kizaru's laser. Luffy and Sanji stay behind as the crew advances. Saturn then encounters Van Augur and Catarina Devon of the Blackbeard Pirates, who reveal their allegiance and hint at Blackbeard's ambitions. Saturn questions their motives before attacking, but they escape with Augur's warping ability. Soon after, they meet Caribou, who begs to join Blackbeard's crew.",
