    "transformers_text": "The New York Times Best Seller list is widely considered the preeminent list of best selling books in the United States 1 2 The New York Times Book Review has published the list weekly since October 12 1931 1 In the 21 st century it has evolved into multiple lists grouped by genre and format including fiction and nonfiction hardcover paperback and e books The list is based on a proprietary method that uses sales figures other data and internal guidelines that are unpublished how the Times compiles the list is a trade secret 3 In 1983 during a legal case in which the Times was sued the Times argued that the list is not mathematically objective but rather an editorial product an argument that prevailed in the courts 4 In 2017 a Times representative said that the goal was that the lists reflect authentic best sellers 5 The list has been a source of controversy When the Times believes a book has reached the list in a suspicious way such as through bulk purchases the book's entry on the list is marked with a dagger symbol 6 The first best seller list in America was published in 1895 by The Book man The New York Times did not publish its first best seller list until October 12 1931 36 years after The Book man 7 4 The NY Times listed five fiction and four nonfiction best selling books for New York City only 4 The next month the list was expanded to eight cities each with its own list 4 By the early 1940 s fourteen city lists were included A national list was created on April 9 1942 in the Sunday New York Times Book Review as a supplement to the Monday edition regular city lists 4 The national list was ranked according to how many times the book appeared in the city lists 4 Eventually the city lists were eliminated leaving only the national ranking list which was compiled according to reports from leading booksellers in 22 cities 4 Ranking by bookseller sales figures continues today although the process has remained proprietary 3 By the 1950 s The Times's list had become the leading best seller list for book professionals to monitor along with that of Publishers Weekly 4 In the 1960 s and 1970 s shopping mall chain bookstores B Dalton Crown Books and Walden books came to the forefront with a business model of selling newly published best sellers with mass market appeal They used the best selling status of titles to market the books and not just as a measure of sales thus placing increased emphasis on the New York Times list for book readers and book sellers 4 The list is compiled by the editors of the News Surveys department not by The New York Times Book Review department where it is published 8 It is based on weekly sales reports obtained from selected samples of independent and chain bookstores and wholesalers throughout the United States 8 The sales figures are widely believed to represent books that have actually been sold at retail rather than wholesale 9 as the Times surveys booksellers in an attempt to better reflect what is purchased by individual buyers Some books are flagged with a dagger indicating that a significant number of bulk orders had been received by retail bookstores 10 The New York Times reported in 2013 that we generally do not track the sales of classic literature and thus for example new translations of Dante's Inferno would not be found on the bestseller list 11 The exact method for compiling the data obtained from the booksellers is classified as a trade secret 3 Book Review staff editor Gregory Cowles explained the method is a secret both to protect our product and to make sure people can't try to rig the system Even in the Book Review itself we don't know the news surveys department's precise methods 8 In 1992 the survey encompassed over 3 000 bookstores as well as representative wholesalers with more than 28 000 other retail outlets including variety stores and supermarkets 3 By 2004 the number was 4 000 bookstores as well as an unstated number of wholesalers 4 Data is adjusted to give more weight to independent book stores which are underrepresented in the sample 4 The lists are divided among fiction and nonfiction print and e book paperback and hardcover each list contains 15 to 20 titles The lists have been subdivided several times Advice How To and Miscellaneous debuted as a list of five on January 1 1984 It was created because advice best sellers were sometimes crowding the general nonfiction list 12 Its inaugural number one bestseller The Body Principal by Victoria Principal had been number 10 and number 12 on the nonfiction lists for the two preceding weeks 13 14 In July 2000 the Children's Best Sellers was created after the Harry Potter series had stayed in the top spots on the fiction list for an extended period of time 15 16 The children's list was printed monthly until February 13 2011 when it was changed to once an issue weekly In September 2007 the paperback fiction list was divided into trade and mass market sections in order to give more visibility to the trade paperbacks that were more often reviewed by the newspaper itself 17 In November 2010 The New York Times announced it would be tracking e book best seller lists in fiction and nonfiction starting in early 2011 18 Royalty Share a San Diego based company that tracks data and aggregates sales information for publishers will provide e book data 18 The two new e book lists were first published with the February 13 2011 issue the first tracks combined print and e book sales the second tracks e book sales only both lists are further sub divided into Fiction and Nonfiction In addition a third new list was published on the web only which tracks combined print sales hardcover and paperback in fiction and nonfiction On December 16 2012 the children's chapter books list was divided into two new lists middle grade ages 8 12 and young adult age 12 18 both which include sales across all platforms hard paper and e book According to an EP J Data Science study that used big data to analyze every New York Times bestselling book from 2008 to 2016 of the 100 000 new hardcover print books published each year fewer than 500 make it on to The New York Times Best Seller list 0 5 percent Many novels 26 percent appear on the list for only one week To make the list it is estimated that novels sell from 1 000 to 10 000 copies per week depending on competition Median sales fluctuate between 4 000 and 8 000 in fiction and 2 000 6 000 in nonfiction The majority of New York Times bestselling books sell from 10 000 to 100 000 copies in their first year 19 20 During the period studied August 6 2008 to March 10 2016 Dan Brown's book The Lost Symbol held the record with 3 million copies sold in one year followed by The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets ' Nest by Sti eg Larsson and Go Set a Watchman by Harper Lee which sold 1 6 million copies each In nonfiction more than half of the hardcover books that make the list are in the biography category The autobiography of George W Bush Decision Points sold the most copies in one year followed by the biography Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacs on 19 The list has been criticized by authors publishers book industry executives and others for not providing an accurate accounting of true best seller status These criticisms have been ongoing ever since the list originated A book industry report in the 1940 s found that best seller lists were a poor indicator of sales since they were based on misleading data and were only measuring fast sales A 2004 report quoted a senior book marketing executive who said the rankings were smoke and mirrors while a report in Book History found that many professionals in the book industry scoffed at the notion that the lists are accurate 4 Specific criticisms include In 1983 author William Peter Blatt y sued The New York Times for 6 million claiming that his book Legion filmed as The Exorcist III had not been included in the list due to either negligence or intentional falsehood saying it should have been included due to high sales The Times countered that the list was not mathematically objective but rather was an editorial product and thus protected under the Constitution as free speech Blatt y appealed it to the Supreme Court which declined to hear the case Thus the lower court ruling stood that the list is editorial content not objective factual content so the Times had the legal right to exclude the book from the list 4 In 1995 Michael Treacy and Fred Wi ers ema the authors of a book called The Discipline of Market Leaders colluded to manipulate their book on to the best seller charts The authors allegedly purchased over 10 000 copies of their own book in small and strategically placed orders at bookstores whose sales are reported to BookS can Because of the benefits of making The New York Times Best Seller list speaking engagements more book deals and consulting the authors felt that buying their own work was an investment that would pay for itself The book climbed to No 4 on the list where it s at for 15 weeks it also peaked at No 1 on the BusinessWeek best seller list Since such lists hold the power of cumulative advantage chart success often begets more chart success Although such efforts are not illegal publishers consider them unethical 27 In 1999 Amazon com announced a 50 decrease in price for books on the Best Seller List to beat its competition Barnes Noble 28 After a legal dispute between Amazon and The New York Times Amazon was permitted to keep using the list on condition that it displayed it in alphabetical rather than numerical order 29 By 2010 this was no longer the case Amazon now displays the best seller list in order of best selling titles first 30 In 2013 Forbes published a story titled Here's How You Buy Your Way On to The New York Times Bestsellers List 31 The article discusses how Result Source a San Diego based marketing consultancy specializes in ensuring books make a bestseller list even guaranteeing a No 1 spot for those willing to pay enough The New York Times was informed of this practice and responded The New York Times comprehensively tracks and tabulates the weekly unit sales of all titles reported by book retailers as their general interest bestsellers We will not comment beyond our methodology on the other questions The New York Times did not alert its readers to this unlike The Wall Street Journal which admitted that books had landed on its bestseller list due to Result Source's campaign 32 So ren Kaplan the source who admitted he had paid Result Source to land his book Leapfrogging on The Wall Street Journal's bestseller list revealed the methodology on his blog he posted If I could obtain bulk orders before Leapfrogging was released Result Source would purchase the books on my behalf using their tried and true formula Three thousand books sold would get me on The Wall Street Journal bestseller list Eleven thousand would secure a spot on the biggest prize of them all The New York Times list 33 In 2014 the Los Angeles Times published a story titled Can bestseller lists be bought 34 It describes how author and pastor Mark Driscoll contracted the company Result Source to place his book Real Marriage 2012 on The New York Times Best Seller list for a 200 000 fee The contract was for Result Source to conduct a bestseller campaign for your book Real Marriage on the week of January 2 2012 The bestseller campaign is intended to place Real Marriage on The New York Times bestseller list for the Advice How to list To achieve this the contract stated that RSI will be purchasing at least 11 000 total orders in one week This took place and the book successfully reached No 1 on the hardcover advice bestseller list on January 22 2014 34 In July 2015 Ted Cruz's book A Time For Truth was excluded from the list because the overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales of Cruz's book were limited to strategic bulk purchases to artificially increase sales and entry on to the list In response Cruz called the Times a liar and demanded an apology 35 The Times said it stood by its statement and evidence of manipulation In August 2017 a young adult fiction book Handbook for Mortals by previously unpublished author Lani S are m was removed from the list where it was initially in the No 1 spot According to a statement issued by the Times after investigating the inconsistencies in the most recent reporting cycle we decided that the sales for Handbook for Mortals did not meet our criteria for inclusion We've issued an updated ' Young Adult Hardcover ' list for September 3 2017 which does not include that title 36 It was uncovered by author Phil S tamper that there had been unusual bulk ordering patterns which inflated the number of sales 37 The book is published by Geek Nation an entertainment website based in Los Angeles 36 The book was originally written as a script and was rewritten as a novel in an attempt to launch a film franchise 38 39 In August 2017 conservative publisher Reg nery Publishing said it would no longer allow its writers to claim to be New York Times best selling authors due to its belief that the Times favors liberal books on the list The Times responded that the political views of authors have no bearing on the list and noted conservative authors routinely rank highly on the list The Associated Press noted the Times is a frequent target of conservatives and Republicans 40 The Washington Post called Reg nery's ban a stunt designed to increase sales What better way to sell a book to a conservative audience than to promote the idea that the New York Times doesn't like it The Post compared the list to best seller lists from Publishers Weekly looking for bias but could not find anything convincing 41 In February 2018 the Toronto Star published a story by books editor Deborah Dundas who found that the best selling book 12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson who topped Publishers Weekly chart list did not even chart on The New York Times bestsellers list without reliable answers from the New York Times The Times stated it was not counted because it was published by a Canadian company 42 According to Random House Canada the book was handled properly for the U S market 43 44 American conservative commentator Dennis Prager wrote an article for National Review titled The Times Best Seller List Another Reason Americans Don't Trust the Media in which he contends that the issue with Peterson's book as well his The Rational Bible Exodus is their conservative context and the lack of inclusion is the American mainstream media's manipulation 45 The Times denied any bias 46 In 2019 the release of Donald Trump Jr 's book Triggered was shown to have only reached the best seller list through approximately 100 000 in behind the scenes bulk purchases meant to pump up its sales numbers illegitimately 47 Vanity Fair reported in October 2020 that this sort of gaming of the system has been a common practice among American conservative political figures and has also included the use of political campaign funds to purchase the books in bulk in order to boost their rank on the list 48 A Stanford Graduate School of Business analysis suggests that the majority of book buyers seem to use the Times ' list as a signal of what's worth reading 49 The study concluded that lesser known writers get the biggest benefit from being on the list while perennial best selling authors such as John Grisham or Danielle Steel see no benefit of additional sales 49",
