Guide With its new realistic approach to giant robots Gundam changed the face of mecha anime and split the genre into two Single handedly inventing the Real Robot subgenre Gundam forced all of its predecessors to be redefined as part of the Super Robot subgenre Not surprisingly Real Robots became all the rage after Gundam Shows such as Combat Armor Doug ram and Walker Machine X a bungle followed the trail To mino had blazed 18 In an interview published in Anime rica magazine To mino discusses what he was trying to accomplish with Mobile Suit Gundam The bottom line is I wanted to have a more realistic robot series unlike a super robot where everything is more reality based based on a humanoid robot Right from the beginning the roots of the mobile suit came from the worker robots that were building the space colonies back then and they would become more technologically advanced to the point of becoming a weapon and that was the whole lineage of the robots I had in mind since the beginning So the whole idea my idea of trying to have a robot series in space without it becoming a stupid story was based on wanting to make a story and surrounding it with reality more realistic possibilities was the underlying concept 19 Although the last quarter of the s how's original script was canceled and it had to be completed in 43 episodes its popularity grew after three compilation movies were released in 1981 and 1982 Mobile Suit Gundam was followed by numerous sequels spin offs and merchandising franchises becoming one of the longest running and most influential popular anime series in history being chosen as No 1 on TV Asahi's Top 100 Anime listing in 2005 20 In 1980 To mino directed Space Runaway Ide on a series which like Mobile Suit Gundam was cancelled on its initial

continued with 1983's Aura Battle r Dun bin e In 1984 To mino released Heavy Metal L Gaim The following year To mino directed the first sequel to 1979's Mobile Suit Gundam Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam To mino's involvement in the following Gundam series 1986's Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ created an upbeat comedic theme whereas the earlier Gundam's are of a darker theme In 1988 To mino concluded the saga
