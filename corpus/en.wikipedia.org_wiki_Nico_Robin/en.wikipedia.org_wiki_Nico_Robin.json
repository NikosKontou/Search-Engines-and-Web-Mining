want to live ' scene is one of the most cathartic moments you'll ever find in fiction 50 Sean Cu bill as of Screen Rant wrote Based on aesthetics alone Nico Robin is an easy fan favorite for her dark mysterious design and attitude Her backstory more than skyrocketed her to legendary status as it brought tears to everyone's eyes and expanded the series ' scope and sense of politics It didn't take long after that for the series to truly immortalize her 43 In another article Cu bill as stated Nico Robin at first sight is clearly one of the edgier characters of the group She has a sharp stare to most and often carries herself with a mysterious demeanor Her introduction into the series as an elite assassin and vice president to an underground organization likely hasn't helped Fortunately for her she's taken to the Straw Hats to lighten her demeanor and in recent stories has become more of a mother figure to the crew However just because she's nicer doesn't mean that she doesn't have the same dark imagination Whenever something dangerous or mysterious happens to the crew Nico Robin always comes up with a darker scenario that dials up everyone's tensions further 51",
