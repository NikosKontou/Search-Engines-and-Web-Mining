meets Boo's human reincarnation Oo b After testing his powers Goku departs with Oo b to train him to be the Earth's new guardian Within roughly six months of creating the popular manga Dr Slump in 1980 Akira Toriyama wanted to end the series but his publisher Shueisha would only allow him to do so if he agreed to start another serial for them shortly after 3 4 He worked with his editor Kazuhiko Torishima on several one shots but none were successful 5 Torishima then suggested that as Toriyama enjoyed kung fu films he should create a kung fu sh nen manga 6 He was inspired by Hong Kong martial arts films such as Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon 1973 and Jackie Chan's Drunken Master 1978 7 8 page needed He was particularly influenced by the fight scenes in Jackie Chan movies 9 and said he would never have come up with Dragon Ball if he had not watched Drunken Master 10 which he enjoyed partly due to its light hearted tone 11 This led to the two part Dragon Boy 12 published in the August and October 1983 issues of Fresh Jump It follows a boy adept at martial arts who escorts a princess on a journey back to her home country Dragon Boy was very well received and evolved to become the serial Dragon Ball 3 13 The plot and characters of Dragon Ball were loosely modeled on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West 13 14 with Goku being Sun Wu kong Son Goku in Japanese Bulma as Tang Sanz ang Oolong as Zhu Baji e and Yam cha being Sha Wu jing 6 Toriyama wanted to create a story with the basic theme of Journey to the West but with a little kung fu 15 by combining the novel with elements from the kung fu films of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee 16 Torishima said he chose the novel largely because it was a free intellectual property but also because its Chinese setting was not common in manga at the time and would make it both unique and differentiate it from Dr Slump's US West Coast feel 3 He changed the objective from Journey to the West where the protagonists travel through the Western Regions Central Asia to collect sacred Buddhist texts from the Indian subcontinent to something simpler gathering seven orbs which grant a wish 17 Toriyama added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give the characters a game like activity of gathering something in order to appeal to it ssh nen manga magazine audience 15 His concept of the Dragon Balls was inspired by the epic Japanese novel Nan s Sato mi Hak ken den 1814 1842 which involves the heroes collecting eight large Buddhist prayer beads of a necklace from eight different regions of Japan which Toriyama adapted into finding seven Dragon Balls from seven different locations he chose the number seven to avoid being the same as the number of beads in Hak ken den 18 19 The title Dragon Ball was inspired by Enter the Dragon as well as later Bruce plo it ation knock off kung fu movies which frequently had the word Dragon in the title 7 He originally thought the story would last about a year or end once the Dragon Balls were collected 5 Toriyama said that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand he specifically aimed Dragon Ball at an older audience than Dr Slump 20 The manga was not popular initially Although he suspected the fighting genre would appeal more to it ssh nen audience Toriyama tried to stick to the Journey to the West adventure aspect which he himself enjoyed such as having the setting change each chapter different enemies popping up and different locations It was only after he became tired of Torishima nagging about its popularity that Toriyama gave in and developed more battles with the first shown Tenkaichi Bud kai Despite his reluctance the author said it felt good when the series picked up in popularity at that point However he said he still tried to resist by returning to the adventure aspect with the Red Ribbon Army arc and visiting Penguin Village from Dr Slump to add comedy When that did not work out fighting became the main theme for the manga 21 Toriyama said that by the second half of the series he had become more interested in coming up with the story than drawing it and that the battles became more intense by him simplifying the lines He also said he would get letters from readers complaining that the art had become too square so he intentionally made it more so 9 Years later he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed so he did not draw very elaborately suggesting that he was not interested in the art 22 As the manga progressed Toriyama struggled with the Android and Cell arc feeling that he could not outdo the Free za arc 21 He added time travel but said he had a hard time with the plot only being able to think of what to do that week 6 After Cell's death Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series ' protagonist but felt the character was not suited for it and changed his mind 6 Even after the Cell arc Toriyama felt it could not end there and so continued to the Maj in Boo arc Having resolved it would be the finale he decided to draw what he wanted and inserted comedy with Gohan's Great Sai yaman person a and the character Goten ks However he did not think of an ending until the final chapter 21 At the time Toriyama said he gave Dragon Ball a low key ending to make it seem as if the story might continue 23 but he would later say he skipped 10 years ahead in the story to signal that it was truly the end Wanting to make it even clearer that Goku's battles were over and a new generation was taking over Toriyama slightly altered the ending for the kan zen ban edition of Dragon Ball which finished in 2004 21 Typically when creating a manga chapter an artist draws a rough draft or name then a more detailed storyboard and lastly the finalized version However Toriyama only draws a storyboard and then the final product simply because it is less work 5 He did not plan the details of his stories in advance When he began the serialization of Dragon Ball he had only prepared storyboard s for three chapters 5 The author said that during its serialization he would wait about two days before his deadline to begin developing the storyboard Starting around midnight he would finish it around six in the morning and spend until that night in king finishing everything in about a day and a half 7 Unlike other artists he had only one assistant helping him 24 Toriyama said that thinking only about the story for each chapter put him in some tight spots particularly with Trunks ' time travel 5 The only thing he has confidence in is his ability to connect a story back to an earlier aspect making it seem to have been foreshadowing 21 The author used suggestions in fan mail he received though generally doing the opposite of what was suggested As an example many fans told him not to kill Vegeta which is exactly what he did 25 Wanting to escape the Western themes that influenced Dr Slump Toriyama used Eastern Oriental scenery in Dragon Ball In addition to referencing Chinese buildings and scenery the island where the Tenkaichi Bud kai is held is modeled on Bali in Indonesia which he visited in 1985 The area around Bobbidi's spaceship was inspired by photos of Africa When including fights in the manga Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid the difficulties of drawing residents and destroyed buildings 26 Toriyama wanted to set Dragon Ball in a fictional world largely based on Asia taking inspiration from several Asian cultures including Japanese Chinese South Asian Central Asian Arabic and Indonesian cultures 27 26 Toriyama was also inspired by the jinn genies from The Arabian Nights 28 For the training scenes Jackie Chan's Drunken Master served as a reference 24 The author said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline was inspired by the beat ' em up video game Spartan X called Kung Fu Master in the West in which enemies appear very fast as the player ascends a tower the game was in turn inspired by Jackie Chan's Wheels on Meals and Bruce Lee's Game of Death and that the fights were similar to the ones in the Tenkaichi Bud kai just not in a tournament setting 6 Toriyama personally dislikes the idea of naming fighting techniques joking that in a real fight you would be killed before you could yell their names but Torishima felt it would be best Toriyama proceeded to create names for all the techniques except for the series ' signature Kamehameha lit Ka meh a me Wave which his wife came up with when he was indecisive about what it should be called He even selected them specifically for each character saying someone like Vegeta would use English names and using kanji for the more sophisticated like Piccolo 26 In order to advance the story quickly by having characters travel without inconvenience he created the flying cloud K into un lit Somersault Cloud then gave most fighters the flying technique Buk jutsu lit Air Dance Technique and granted Goku the teleportation ability S hunk an Id lit Instant Teleport 26 While talking to his long time friend and fellow manga artist Masakazu Katsura about how there was nothing stronger than a Super Saiyan Katsura suggested having two characters fuse together leading to the creation of the Fusion Fy jon technique 29 30 Toriyama enjoyed designing and drawing the distinctive machines of the series 21 He finds the most fun in designing original mecha thinking about how a pilot enters and where the engine is With real world items he would have to look at references and being off even a little would be noticeable 9 He goes against whatever is popular at the time explaining that when he was creating Dragon Ball most cars were very square so he drew only round car designs 21 In 1995 Toriyama detailed the equipment he used for Dragon Ball He used a G penn ib by Zebra usually getting three chapters out of one because he typically does not press down hard Toriyama used black drawing ink made by Pilot but his color ink was produced by Luma and applied with a ten year old fine point Ten sh d brush His whiteout was also made by Luma He received free Kent paper similar to Bristol board from a seller connected to Shueisha and used a 0 5 mm 2 B lead mechanical pencil and a wide ruler at least 30 cm long 31 When creating a character his process was to draw their face and body type first and then the clothes while thinking if the fighters can move around in them 25 He said that he does not draw bad guys so unscrupulous that it affects readers psychologically This is not out of concern for others but because he does not enjoy drawing such things 21 Few of his characters have screen tone because he found it difficult to use Toriyama was not concerned about consistency with the color of characters ' clothes for the occasional color pages having sometimes used different ones than he had before 9 He even specifically asked Torishima to produce as few color pages as possible 22 Character names are almost always puns sharing a theme with characters related to them most commonly food For example all Saiyans are named after vegetables sai ya being an anagram of the syllables for yas a i which means vegetable such as Kakar rot Kakar otto taken from carrot kya rot to 15 Going against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size he designed many of Dragon Ball's most powerful characters including Goku with small statures 32 Toriyama explained that he had Goku grow up so that drawing fight scenes would be easier even though Torishima was against it initially because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically 22 Torishima later referred to this as his own biggest crisis during the series with Toriyama threatening to end it if Goku could not grow up The editor said his concerns were unfounded as readers accepted the change without complaint 5 Having created Piccolo Dai mao as the first truly evil villain he said that his part of the series was the most interesting to draw 6 Free za was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and inspired by real estate speculators who Toriyama called the worst kind of people 6 Y Kond Toriyama's second editor from the Saiyan arc until the appearance of Perfect Cell and Fu yu to Takeda his third editor from Perfect Cell until the end of the series said that Dragon Ball hit its peak in popularity during the Free za arc In a one thousand ballot popularity poll held in Weekly Sh nen Jump Dragon Ball received 815 votes 33 Finding the escalating enemies difficult Toriyama created the G in yu Force to add more balance to the manga 6 When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan transformation during the Free za arc he gave Goku blond hair because it was easier to draw for Toriyama's assistant who spent a lot of time blacking in Goku's hair He also gave him piercing eyes based on Bruce Lee's paralyzing glare 34 Dragon Ball was serialized in Shueisha's sh nen manga anthology Weekly Sh nen Jump from November 20 1984 to May 23 1995 35 36 c As the readership of Dragon Ball grew up the magazine changed to reflect their changing interests 39 The 519 individual chapters were collected in 42 tank bon volumes by Shueisha from September 10 1985 through August 4 1995 40 41 These saw any color or partly colored artwork grayscale d 42 With their predominantly white color and the singular picture that continues across their various spines Torishima said the covers to these collected volumes were purposely designed to stick out on store bookshelves 43 For the series ' 24 th anniversary the tank bon covers were revamped to a design that has been used on all reprints since 2009 44 Between December 4 2002 and April 2 2004 Dragon Ball was released in a collection of 34 kan zen ban volumes that retain the color artwork from its Weekly Sh nen Jump run 45 46 It received newly drawn cover illustrations by Toriyama and each volume included a poster of their respective front cover image These new illustrations were initially drawn in ink scanned into a computer and colored using Corel Painter Midway through Toriyama changed to drawing them on a graphics tablet and coloring them with Adobe Photoshop 4 UV curing was used to add shine to the characters and some characters are in monochrome up until volume 18 47 The kan zen ban edition was designed by Hideaki Shimada Although Toriyama had already drafted the first four covers with a vibrant green Shimada proposed bright red after seeing South Korea compete in the 2002 FIFA World Cup and he agreed 47 Wanting a neater look than the tank bon Shimada decided to write Dragonball in lowercase and in a taller and thinner font He also asked Toriyama to draw Shen long with thick lines for use as the inside covers 47 It was an editor who suggested having a singular picture that continues across the various spines but unlike the tank bon edition the number of volumes was already determined so they knew exactly how long it needed to be 47 The December 2012 cover date February 2013 issue of V Jump announced that parts of the manga would be fully colored digitally and re released as Dragon Ball Full Color 48 20 volumes beginning from chapter 195 and grouped by story arcs were released between

appeared in Sai ky Jump magazine's regular Dragon Ball Super Gallery feature from 2021 to 2025 56 The English language version of the Dragon Ball manga is licensed for North America by Viz Media Viz originally published the first 194 chapters as Dragon Ball and chapters over 195 as Dragon Ball Z to mimic the names of the anime series feeling it would reduce the potential for confusion by its readers They initially released both series simultaneously chapter by chapter in a monthly comic book format starting in 1998 before stopping in 2000 to switch to a graphic novel format similar to the Japanese tank bon In 2000 while releasing Dragon Ball in the monthly format Viz began to censor the manga in response to parental complaints about sexual innuendos 57 58 Viz changed their publishing format for the series again in 2003 the first 10 collected volumes of both series were re released under their Shonen Jump imprint They have slightly smaller dimensions The manga was completed in

first time in English that the entire series was released under the Dragon Ball name though it is still censored 69 70 Viz serialized chapters 195 to 245 of the fully colored version of the manga in their digital anthology Weekly Shonen Jump from February 2013 to February 2014 71 They published the Saiyan and Free za arcs of Dragon Ball Full Color Edition in large format volumes between February

their stores nationwide when a Dallas parent complained that the series had borderline soft porn after he bought them for his four year old son 81 Commenting on the issue manga critic Susan J Napier determined the ban as a difference in culture due to Japan having tolerance for sexuality in manga while other countries do not 81 After the ban Viz reluctantly began to censor the series in 2000 to maintain its wide distribution 58 82 Viz made some concessions as well 82 and assured readers that all changes were approved by Toriyama and Shueisha Toriyama made suggestions himself such as obscuring Goku's genitals with objects rather than neuter him 82 A fan petition was created garnering over 10 000 signatures and a year later Viz announced they would stop censoring Dragon Ball and increased its age rating to 13 and up instead reprinting the first three graphic novels 58 83 However they continued to censor several characters ' lips by shading them in completely This avoided racist stereotypes such as that of Mr Popo's image 84 In October 2009 Wi comic o County Public Schools in Maryland banned the Dragon Ball manga from their school district because it depicts nudity sexual contact between children and sexual innuendo among adults and children 81 Esther Keller Robin Brenner and Eva Vol in of School Library Journal had no opinion on whether or not removing the manga from all schools in that district was right However Brenner and Vol in criticized the parents who had a problem with the manga for going to a county council member who is involved with politics

the model for other sh nen series such as Naruto 126 Thompson cited the artwork as influential pointing out that popular sh nen manga of the late 1980 s and early 1990 s had manly heroes such as City

decades after it ended Toriyama said Frankly I don't quite understand why it happened While the manga was being serialized the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through I dare say I don't care even if my works have left nothing behind as long as they have entertained their readers 127 The manga has received a mostly positive reception from critics Jason Thompson commented that Dragon Ball turns from a gag adventure manga to a nearly pure fighting manga 125 James S Ya dao author of The Rough Guide to Manga explains that the first several chapters play out much like Sai yuki Journey to the West with Dr Slump like humour built in and that Dr Slump Toriyama's previous manga has a clear early influence on the series He feels the series established its unique identity after the first time Goku's group disbands and he trains under Ka me Sen ' n in On the second half of the manga he commented that it developed a far more action packed sinister tone with wilder battles and aerial and spiritual elements with an increased death count 17 David Brothers for Comics Alliance wrote that Like Osamu Tezuka and Jack Kirby before him Toriyama created a story with his own two hands that seeped deep into the hearts of his readers creating a love for both the cast and the medium at the same time He said that while the author has a sublime combination of Looney Tunes style classic humor and dirty jokes the best part of Dragon Ball is the fight scenes Brothers explained that while Western superhero comics would focus on a series of cool poses or impact shots with the reader having to fill in the blanks between panels Dragon Ball has a panel dedicated to one action and the next panel features the very next maneuver making them incredibly easy to follow 128 Fu sano suke Natsume says that the theme of disaster and growth in the manga is a reference to post War Japanese manga that Osamu Tezuka began in the mid 1940 s He also comments that the violence in the manga has context that children can understand and is not just there at random 129 While Toriyama has said that Journey to the West was an influence on the manga Xavier M nguez L pez comments that it is a parody of the Chinese novel since the stories are similar He notes that Toriyama uses Chinese mythology and Japanese folktales the dragon Shen long who is summoned from the Dragon Balls as well as characters who are able to come back to life as examples of similarities 130 Rachel Cantrell says that the manga parodies martial arts very well and mentions how Toriyama uses panels to a full extent She notes that the manga has a coming of age theme due to how the story captures Goku from a child to an adult 131 Dr Fr d ric Du carme compared Goku's backstory to that of Superman with whom the character has often been compared but wrote that Goku remains a sportsman throughout the manga not an avenger or vigilante 132 Carlo Santos of the Anime News Network described Dragon Ball's setting as a melting pot of sci fi fantasy and folklore Santos praised its quick development of new characters and storylines and claimed that the series ' crowning achievement is in its dynamic fight scenes However he did not enjoy the clich training and tournament segments nor its crude humor 133 His colleague Allen Divers praised the manga's story and humor as being very good at conveying all the characters ' personalities Divers also called Viz's translation one of the best of all the English editions of the series due to its faithfulness to the original Japanese 134 Anime rica felt the series had worldwide appeal using dramatic pacing and over the top martial arts action to maintain tension levels and keep a crippler crossface hold on the audience's attention spans 135 Comic Book Bin's Leroy Dour esse aux described Toriyama as a super cartoonist a blend of Carl Barks Jack Kirby and Peyo He gave Dragon Ball a perfect rating and called it one of the best manga and comic books he has ever read 136 Rid wan Khan of Anime fringe com commented that the manga had a chubby art style but as the series continued the characters became more refined leaner and more muscular He cited one slight problem in Viz's release the translation uses informal language to capture Goku's country accent but it ends up feeling forced and odd Khan prefers the manga over the slow pacing of the anime adaptations 137 Including it on a list of 10 Essential Manga That Should Belong in Every Comic Collection Matthew Mey li kho v of Paste also praised the manga over the anime as an entirely different and more involved experience He wrote that You come to know and care for the characters more intimately and the joy and wonder of watching them fight learn and grow throughout the series improves tenfold 138 Manga author Nobuhiro Wat suki commented that there was a shift in the traditional portrayal of protagonists and their adversaries engaging in killings in sh nen manga after Dragon Ball started a trend of bringing characters back to life 139 Dragon Ball is considered one of the most influential manga of all time
