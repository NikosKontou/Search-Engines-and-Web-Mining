Desperate to finish him off, Marigold and Sandersonia attempt to finish him off with their strongest moves, but Luffy fights them off and ties their tails together. Marigold's fire attack accidentally burns the clothes off Sandersonia's back, prompting Hancock to order everyone to evacuate or risk seeing the \"Gorgon Eyes\".
