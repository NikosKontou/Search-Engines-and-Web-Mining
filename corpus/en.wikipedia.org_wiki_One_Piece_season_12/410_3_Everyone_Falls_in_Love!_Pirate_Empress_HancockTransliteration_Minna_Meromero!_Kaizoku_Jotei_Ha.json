Margaret then realizes that she cannot afford to be friendly with Luffy, and attacks him, forcing him to flee. A few kilometers from the island, Boa Hancock - the Snake Princess and one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea - meets with a Navy vessel commanded by Vice-Admiral Momonga, who informs her of Portgas D. Ace's upcoming execution and the likelihood of Whitebeard intervening. He orders her to join the fight against Whitebeard's forces or risk losing her status as a Warlord and having the treaty between Kuja and the World Government annulled. Hancock refuses and, using her Love-Love Fruit powers, turns his men to stone and leaves.",
