    "transformers_text": "Sakamoto Days stylized in all caps is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yu to Suzuki j a It has been serialized in Shueisha's sh nen manga magazine Weekly Sh nen Jump since November 2020 with its chapters collected in 25 tank bon volumes as of December 2025 It is simultaneously published in English by Viz Media and the Manga Plus online platform The story revolves around Taro Sakamoto a retired legendary hitman who has settled into a quiet and mundane life as a family man However his peaceful life is disrupted when former enemies and colleagues from his hitman days come seeking revenge To protect his family and loved ones Sakamoto must use his exceptional combat skills to face off against a variety of adversaries while trying to maintain his ordinary facade An anime television series adaptation produced by TMS Entertainment aired from January to March 2025 with a second cours aired from July to September of the same year Alive action film adaptation is set to premiere in Japan in Q 2 2026 By August 2025 the manga had over 15 million copies in circulation Taro Sakamoto used to be an unrivaled hitman earning legendary status in the criminal underworld by being feared by some and idolized by others One day however Sakamoto fell in love at first sight with Aoi a convenience store clerk For them to date Aoi gave him the ultimatum that he must quit being a hitman and never kill again Sakamoto agreed and after his retirement they started dating got married had a daughter named Hana and eventually opened a family run convenience store of their own in the suburbs of Tokyo Several years later Sakamoto has settled into his humble life but also grown portly as a result of his relative inactivity despite still being immensely powerful The world of hitmen eventually locates him and many soon attempt to target the Sakamoto family either seeking revenge or resenting his retired status Now with the help of three other former criminals who become employed at the store under Sakamoto clairvoyant hitman Shin A sakura orphaned crime boss daughter Lu Xiao tang and sniper He i suke Mashimo Sakamoto must protect his family or die trying against the criminal underworld all while maintaining Aoi's no kill policy The idea of pairing up Taro Sakamoto with a character that can read minds allowed for insight into the character's motivations and for comedy to flourish since Suzuki intended for Sakamoto to be a quieter and reserved character According to editor Sous hiro Ishikawa Suzuki focuses on readability while creating action scenes and his background in Nihon ga style of painting allows him to create interesting layouts Suzuki and Ishikawa would hold meetings every week in person to discuss how to progress the story but after the C OVID 19 pandemic they hold meetings online 2 Suzuki is influenced by manga artists Katsuhiro O tomo Take hi ko Inoue and Hiro ya Oku and by the works of director Christopher Nolan 3 He draws inspiration from action films such as The Equalizer and the John Wick series 2 Suzuki originally drew dark one shot stories However when creating Sakamoto Days he opted for a more lighthearted tone to better suit the demands of weekly serialization For the concept of Sakamoto being a retired hitman Suzuki said he was fascinated with the idea of a fat person being incredibly strong thinking as well about the reasons that led him to that state Why is he fat Because he retired Why is that Maybe because he got married That's how I made it He was particularly intrigued by the idea of a strong obese fighter a notion that was partly influenced by the comedic action film Enter the Fat Dragon Regarding action scenes Suzuki strives to captivate readers by incorporating unexpected twists and surprises He employs an analog pen for character illustrations and works with a team of assistants The character Shin emerged from Suzuki's interest in exploring the potential of an es per who interacts with Sakamoto through telepathy Meanwhile Lu was conceived as a Chinese assassin heroine reflecting Suzuki's desire to diversify the cast Although Suzuki acknowledges that his characters can sometimes be difficult to distinguish visually he found Gaku to be the easiest to draw due his independent personality Suzuki commented that he had already planned the ending of the series by 2022 3 The series is set to start its final battle on August 4 2025 4 For the animated adaptation Masaki Watanabe j a served as the director Watanabe noted that Sakamoto's design reflects the original manga's expressiveness while distinguishing his two forms the fat version has a symbolically deformed face while the skinny version is more realistic Watanabe highlighted Sakamoto's distinctive personality and calm daily life which create a striking contrast during action sequences involving his obese physique The director also emphasized the unique sound effects and vocal performances for Shin which were carefully crafted under his guidance Reflecting on the narrative Watanabe noted that despite its comedic foundation the series occasionally delivers unexpected moments of violence an aspect he found particularly commendable 5 Despite his experience with sh nen manga Watanabe found Sakamoto Days to be a unique challenge as he aimed to balance intense action sequences with the lighthearted tone established by Suzuki One of the most demanding scenes in the early episodes involved a rollercoaster fight which required extensive time to create a detailed 3 D model and manage the scene's vibrant color palette The animation was done using Clip Studio Paint and Adobe incorporating a paper texture to enhance the visual style of the action sequences Additionally the team researched real firearms to ensure their accurate depiction in the anime 6 Tomokazu Su gita voices the protagonist Taro Sakamoto having previously been familiar with the original manga series Initially cast as Kashima he was later asked to voice Sakamoto instead appreciating the character's relationships with family and friends Nobunaga Shima zak i voices Shin A sakura who noted that the character's perceived weakness and lack of skill despite being over 20 creates a deliberate contrast with the stronger more experienced characters enhancing the cast's balance and making the dynamics more engaging Lu Xiao tang is voiced by Aya ne Sakura who enjoyed exploring the character's dynamic interactions 7 Sakamoto Days is written and illustrated by Yu to Suzuki j a Suzuki first published a
