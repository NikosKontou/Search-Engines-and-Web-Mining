body through a series of tests 2 3 4 Yusuke succeeds with the help of his friends Keik o Yu kimura and Kazuma K uwa bara After returning to life Ko enma grants Yusuke the title of Underworld Detective Rei kai Tan tei lit Spirit World Detective Spirit Detective in the English dub charging him with investigating supernatural activity within the Human World Ning en Kai Soon Yusuke is off on his first case retrieving three treasures stolen from the Underworld by a gang of demons Hiei Ku rama and Go ki 4 Yusuke collects the three treasures with the aid of his new technique the Rei Gun a shot of aura or Re iki Re iki lit Spirit Energy fired mentally from his index finger 2 3 He then travels to the mountains in search of the aged female martial arts master Gen kai Together with his rival K uwa bara Yusuke fights through a tournament organized by Gen kai to find her successor Yusuke uses the competition as a cover to search for Ran do a demon who steals the techniques of martial arts masters and kills them 4 Yusuke defeats Ran do in the final round of the tournament and trains with Gen kai for several months gaining more mastery over his aura 3 Yusuke is then sent to Labyrinth Castle in the Demon Plane Makai lit Demon World a third world occupied solely by demons where K uwa bara and the newly reformed Ku rama and Hiei assist him in defeating the Four Beasts a quartet of demons attempting to blackmail Ko enma into removing the barrier keeping them out of the Human World Yusuke's next case sends him on a rescue mission where he meets To guro a human turned into a demon To test his strength To guro invites Yusuke to the Dark Tournament An koku B uju tsukai lit Dark Martial Arts Association an event put on by corrupt rich humans in which teams of demons and occasionally humans fight fierce battles for the chance to receive any wish they desire Team U ramesh i consisting of Yusuke K uwa bara Ku rama Hiei and a disguised Gen kai traverses through the strenuous early rounds to face Team To guro in the finals and win the tournament They learn that Team To guro's owner S a kyo was attempting to win to create a large hole from the Human World to the Demon Plane and allow countless demons through 3 With his loss S a kyo destroys the tournament arena killing himself in the process After the tournament Yusuke returns home but has little time to rest as he is challenged to a fight by three teenagers possessing superhuman powers who take the detective hostage K uwa bara and the others rescue him and learn that the scenario was a test from Gen kai It is disclosed that Shinobu Sen sui Yusuke's predecessor as Underworld Detective has recruited six other powerful beings to help him take over where S a kyo left off opening a hole to the Demon Plane to cause genocide of the human race Yusuke and his friends challenge and defeat Sen sui's associates individually culminating in a final battle between the two detectives Sen sui kills Yusuke and then retreats into the newly opened portal to the Demon Plane Yusuke is reborn as a partial demon discovering that his ancestor passed down a recessive gene that would hide until an heir with sufficient power surfaced when his demonic lineage would be revealed 3 Yusuke travels to the Demon Plane and defeats Sen sui with the aid of his ancestor who takes control of Yusuke's body to finish the fight As they return to the Human World Yusuke is stripped of his detective title in fear that Yusuke's demon blood could cause him to go on a rampage in the Human World Yusuke unsettled at having been controlled by his ancestor Rai zen accepts an offer by Rai zen's followers to return to the Demon Plane Rai zen desiring a successor to his territory is on the brink of dying of starvation a death that would topple the delicate political balance of the three ruling powers of the Demon Plane The other two rulers Mu kuro and Yomi summon Hiei and Ku rama respectively to prepare for an inevitable war 3 The three protagonists train in the realm for one year during which time Rai zen dies and Yusuke inherits his territory Yusuke takes the initiative and proposes a fighting tournament to name the Demon Plane's true ruler Mu kuro and Yomi agree to Yusuke's terms During the tournament Yusuke and Yomi meet in the second elimination round where Yusuke is defeated Yusuke hopes a similar competition will be held every few years to determine the Demon Plane's ruler Two years later Yusuke returns to the Human World while Hiei stays with Mu kuro and protects humans who have accidentally wandered into the Demon Plane After learning that King Enma was falsifying reports on demon activity against humans in order to justify keeping the two separated Ko enma takes over his father's position and allows access between the Demon Plane and the Human World Gen kai dies and leaves her estate to the main characters The story ends with Yusuke and his friends reuniting at a beach Author Yoshihiro Togas hi stated that he began working on YuYu Hakusho around November 1990 though he forgot the exact time 5 He had recently completed the serialization of his romantic comedy Ten de Sh war u Cupid in Weekly Sh nen Jump Having felt somewhat intimidated by some of his more popular fellow authors during this manga's run Togas hi realized he would need to create a fighting manga to both gain popularity and write something he enjoyed 6 As a fan of the occult and horror films he desired to write and illustrate a new manga based on his interests 7 Togas hi had previously published an occult detective fiction manga titled Occult Tant eid an of which he referenced positive reception from readers as a reason for continuing to create manga 8 When first producing YuYu Hakusho he did not have a clear idea of what he wanted to call it He used the tentative title How to be a Ghost while presenting rough drafts to his editors Once given the go ahead to begin publication Togas hi proposed YuYu Ki Poltergeist Chronicles for the title as there would be battles with demons and it would be a play on the titleS a i Yu Ki However a series with a similar name Chin Yu Ki had already begun publication so Togas hi quickly created an alternative YuYu Hakusho Poltergeist Report 9 He commented that he could have used Den Legend or Mono g atari Story but Hakusho Report was the first thing that came to his mind 10 He contiguous ly developed the names of the main characters by skimming through a dictionary and taking out kanji characters he found appealing Yusuke U ramesh i is a pun Kazuma K uwa bara is a combination of two professional baseball players and Hiei and Ku rama are just names that popped into Togas hi's head 7 When he introduced the latter two characters in volume three the author had early plans to make Ku rama a main character but was not certain about Hiei 6 7 The manga's shift from occult detective fiction to the martial arts genre after Yusuke's death and revival in the early chapters was planned by Togas hi from the beginning 7 He took this idea from the series Kinn i kum an which began largely as a comedy before concentrating more on action 6 Togas hi intended to establish the main characters and familiarize the reader with them before placing them in tense physical conflicts His editor at the time was nervous about him beginning the manga this way and recommended he transition to a battle focused plot after about 30 chapters 6 YuYu Hakusho borrows many elements from Asian folklore particularly Buddhist beliefs in the afterlife 2 4 Togas hi came up with the concept of theN in gen kai Human World Rei kai Underworld and Makai Demon Plane as being parallel planes of existence in the manga's universe He thought of them as places that one could not easily travel between using modern technology but rather as a spirit lacking a material body 7 However the idea for the territory powers from the Sen sui story arc was parodied from a separate unnamed work by Yasutaka Tsu tsui 11 12 For his drawing materials Togas hi used drafting ink and Kab ura pens throughout the creation of the series While his style of artwork began with screen tone he gradually developed into minimalism As the series progressed he would draw figures and faces very detailed or cartoon y sketchy and jumping with action whenever he desired such effects 7 During the years he worked on YuYu Hakusho Togas hi would calculate the personal time he had based on a formula of four hours per page without scripting and five hours of sleep per night 13 He wrote in his own d j in shi Yoshi r in de Pon that he stopped the production on YuYu Hakusho out of selfishness 14 The author had originally wanted to end the manga in December 1993 at the climax of the Sen sui arc 11 14 Although there was not a great demand from the editorial staff Togas hi was under a great deal of personal stress at certain points of the series ' run particularly during its final six months of publication He claimed that beginning with the Dark Tournament arc inconsistent sleep resulting from overwork was causing him health problems 14 He noted he was very ill while working on the color pages for Yusuke's match with Chu 11 There were many instances where he would create nearly entire manuscripts by himself such as Yusuke's meeting with Rai zen and the battle between Ku rama and Kara su 14 The publication's editors tried to make Togas hi reconsider canceling Yu Yu Hakusho though he justified his decision by stating that it would simply be replaced by another popular series 6 Togas hi was relieved at the conclusion of the manga 11 The author claimed he was not involved in the production of the YuYu Hakusho anime adaptation due to his work schedule He stated that he was greatly impressed by Shigeru Chiba's voice depiction of K uwa bara admitting that the actor understood the character better than Togas hi himself 15 The YuYu Hakusho manga series was written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togas hi and originally serialized by Shueisha in the sh nen manga magazine Weekly Sh nen Jump from December 3 1990 to July 25 1994 16 17 18 19 The manga consists of 175

manga serialization sparked a controversy when a Florida grade school teacher issued a complaint about material found in an issue of the American Shonen Jump magazine purchased by a fifth grade student at a Scholastic Book Fair The complaint centered around portions of the manga containing violence mild profanity a character wearing a swastika and another character smoking a cigarette About 18 000 copies of the publication out of 120 000 were returned from the fairs as a result of the matter A Viz spokesperson defended the manga clarifying that it is intended for older teens and that the alleged swastika is actually a Buddhist man ji 95 The YuYu Hakusho manga publication has received mixed criticism from reviewers in English speaking regions Martin Ouellet te of the Canadian Proto culture Addicts compared the progression of the series to Dragon Ball Zand stated Togas hi's art while simple is extremely efficient and the story is really fun 96 An older article by the same reviewer disagreed with the notion that YuYu Hakusho was similar to Dragon Ball stating that the former franchise has better developed characters more interesting action sequences and more humor 4 Eduardo M Chavez of Mania com enjoyed the manga's artwork and found that the supporting characters tend to be illustrated with more detail than the main characters He praised Lillian Olsen's English translation but disliked Viz's use of overlaying English words to translate the expression of sound effects In later volumes Chavez was dismayed by the transition of the manga from the early detective cases to the Dark Tournament arc He asserted Seeing fight after fight after fight gets boring and this seriously is only the start of this trend 97 Dan Polley a staff reviewer of Manga Life gave an average grade to the fifth volume which entails Yusuke's battle with Suzaku the leader of the Four Beasts Although he found some battle sequences engaging Polley judged the chapters as lacking in characterization and development Polley also discounted the manga's comedy considering the bit gags or fairly lame jokes to be too much at times 98 2023",
