    "transformers_text": "PubMed Central PM C is a free digital repository that archives open access full text scholarly articles that have been published in biomedical and life sciences journals As one of the major research databases developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information NC BI PubMed Central is more than a document repository Submissions to PM C are indexed and formatted for enhanced metadata medical ontology and unique identifiers which enrich the XML structured data for each article 1 Content within PM C can be linked to other NC BI databases and accessed via Entre z search and retrieval systems further enhancing the public's ability to discover read and build upon its biomedical knowledge 2 PubMed Central is distinct from PubMed 3 PubMed Central is a free digital archive of full articles accessible to anyone from anywhere via a web browser with varying provisions for reuse Conversely although PubMed is a searchable database of biomedical citations and abstracts the full text article resides elsewhere in print or online free or behind a subscriber pay wall PubMed Central began as E biome d initially proposed in May 1999 by then NIH director Harold Var mus 4 The idea came to him abruptly in December 1998 inspired by the early use of ar Xiv for pre prints after a presentation from Pat Brown of Stanford and David Lipman director of NC BI 5 6 But my views broadened abruptly one morning in December of 1998 when I met Pat Brown for coffee at the caf that was formerly the famed T as s a jara Bakery on the corner of Cole and Parnassus during a visit to San Francisco A few weeks before our coffee Pat had learned about the methods being used by the physicist Paul G in spar g and his colleagues at Los Alamos to allow physicists and mathematicians to share their work with one another over the Internet They were posting pre prints articles not yet submitted or accepted for publication at a publicly accessible website called Lan X or ar Xiv for anyone to read and critique The more I thought about this the more I was convinced that a radical restructuring of methods for publishing transmitting storing and using biomedical research reports might be possible and beneficial In a spirit of enthusiasm and political innocence I wrote a lengthy manifesto proposing the creation of an NIH supported online system called E biome d The goal of E biome d was to provide free access to all biomedical research Papers submitted to E biome d could take one of two routes either immediately published as a pre print or through a traditional peer review process The peer review process was to resemble contemporary overlay journals with an external editorial board retaining control over the process of reviewing cu rating and listing papers which would otherwise be freely accessible on the central E biome d server Var mus intended to realize the new possibilities presented by communicating scientific results digitally imagining continuous conversation about published work version ed documents and enriched layered formats allowing for multiple levels of detail 4 The proposal to create a central index of biomedical research was a radical departure from prevailing publishing norms Prior to the internet publication indexes operated largely like ISBNs allocated by registration agencies to secondary publishers The idea that anyone could own their own address space via a domain name and create their own indexing system was a wholly new idea 7 8 Major commercial publishers had begun experimenting with an indexing system for scientific papers shared across publishers as early as 1993 and were spurred to action following the E biome d proposal At the October 1999 STM Annual Frankfurt Conference several publishers led by Springer Verlag reached a hurried conference room consensus to launch their competitor prototype 9 At the Board meeting of the STM association held the afternoon of Monday October 11 before the fair's Wednesday opening discussion focused on an emerging U S National Library of Medicine NLM initiative called E Biome d later PubMed Central that had been proposed by Harold Var mus of the National Institutes of Health in the spring of 1999 Var mus envisioned a digital archive of journals accessible free of charge and with the added value of reference linking Our consensus was that publishers should be the ones doing the linking said Bob Campbell who chaired the meeting Since we were ' higher up the stream ' so to speak we should be able to link our articles ahead of the NLM as part of the process of producing them Stefan von Holtzbrinck then set the ball rolling by offering to link Nature publications with anyone else's We decided to issue an announcement of a broad STM reference linking initiative It was of course a strategic move only since we had neither plan nor prototype A small group led by Arno ud de Kemp of Springer Verlag met in an adjacent room immediately following the Board meeting to draft the announcement which was distributed to all attendees of the STM annual meeting the following day and published in an STM membership publication The potential benefit of the service that would become Cross Ref was immediately apparent Organizations such as A IP and I OP Institute of Physics had begun to link to each other's publications and the impossibility of replicating such one off arrangements across the industry was obvious As Tim In golds by later put it All those linking agreements were going to kill us Under pressure from vigorous lobbying from commercial publishers and scientific societies who feared for lost profits 10 NIH officials announced a revised PubMed Central proposal in August 1999 5 PM C would receive submissions from publishers rather than from authors as in E biome d Publications were allowed time embargoed pay walls up to one year PM C would only allow peer reviewed work no pre prints 11 The then unnamed publisher led linking system shortly thereafter became Cross Ref and the larger DOI system Var mus Brown and others including Michael Eisen went on to found the Public Library of Science PLo S in 2001 reaching the conclusion that if we really want to change the publication of scientific research we must do the publishing ourselves 12 Launched in February 2000 the repository has grown rapidly as the NIH Public Access Policy is designed to make all research funded by the National Institutes of Health NIH freely accessible to anyone and in addition many publishers are working cooperatively with the NIH to provide free access to their works citation needed In late 2007 the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 H R 2764 was signed into law and included a provision requiring the NIH to modify its policies and require inclusion into PubMed Central complete electronic copies of their peer reviewed research and findings from NIH funded research These articles are required to be included within 12 months of publication This is the first time the US government has required an agency to provide open access to research and is an evolution from the 2005 policy in which the NIH asked researchers to voluntarily add their research to PubMed Central 13 A UK version of the PubMed Central system UK PubMed Central UK PM C has been developed by the Wellcome Trust and the British Library as part of a nine strong group of UK research f under s This system went live in January 2007 On 1 November 2012 it became Europe PubMed Central The Canadian member of the PubMed Central International network PubMed Central Canada was launched in October 2009 The National Library of Medicine NLM Journal Publishing Tag Set journal article markup language is freely available 14 The Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers comments that it is likely to become the standard for preparing scholarly content for both books and journals 15 A related DTD is available for books 16 The Library of Congress and the British Library have announced support for the NLM DTD 17 It has also been popular with journal service providers 18 With the release of public access plans for many agencies beyond NIH PM C is in the process of becoming the repository for a wider variety of articles 19 This includes NASA content with the interface branded as Pub Space 20 21 As of December 2018 update the PM C archive contained over 5 2 million articles 22 with contributions coming from publishers or authors depositing their manuscripts into the repository per the NIH Public Access Policy Earlier data shows that from January 2013 to January 2014 author initiated deposits exceeded 103 000 papers during a 12 month period 23 PM C identifies about 4 000 journals which participate in some capacity to deposit their published content into the PM C repository 24 Some publishers delay the release of their articles on PubMed Central for a set time after publication referred to as an embargo period ranging from a few months to a few years depending on the journal Embargoes of six to twelve months are the most common PubMed Central is a key example of systematic external distribution by a third party 25 which some publishers purport to prohibit through private contracts citation needed Articles are sent to PubMed Central by publishers in XML or SGML using a variety of article DTD s Older and larger publishers may have their own established in house DTD s but many publishers use the NLM Journal Publishing DTD see above Received articles are converted via XSLT to the very similar NLM Archiving and Interchange DTD This process may reveal errors that are reported back to the publisher for correction Graphics are also converted to standard formats and sizes The original and converted forms are archived The converted form is moved into a relational database along with associated files for graphics multimedia or other associated data Many publishers also provide PDF of their articles and these are made available without change 26 Bibliographic citations are parsed and automatically linked to the relevant abstracts in PubMed articles in PubMed Central and resources on publishers ' Web sites PubMed links also lead to PubMed Central Un re solvable references such as to journals or particular articles not yet available at one of these sources are tracked in the database and automatically come live when the resources become available An in house indexing system provides search capability and is aware of biological and medical terminology such as generic vs proprietary drug names and alternate names for organisms diseases and anatomical parts When a user accesses a journal issue a table of contents is automatically generated by retrieving all articles letters editorials etc for that issue When an actual item such as an article is reached PubMed Central converts the NLM markup to HTML for delivery and provides links to related data objects This is feasible because the variety of incoming data has first been converted to standard DTD s and graphic formats In a separate submission stream NIH funded authors may deposit articles into PubMed Central using the NIH Manuscript Submission NI HMS Articles thus submitted typically go through XML markup in order to be converted to NLM DTD Reactions to PubMed Central among the scholarly publishing community range between a genuine enthusiasm by some 27 to cautious concern by others 28 While PM C is a welcome partner to open access publishers in its ability to augment the discovery and dissemination of biomedical knowledge that same truth causes others to worry about traffic being diverted from the published version of record the economic consequences of less readership as well as the effect on maintaining a community of scholars within learned societies 29 30 A 2013 analysis found strong evidence that public repositories of published articles were responsible for drawing significant numbers of readers away from journal websites and that the effect of PM C is growing over time 30 Libraries universities open access supporters consumer health advocacy groups and patient rights organizations have applauded PubMed Central and hope to see similar public access repositories developed by other federal funding agencies so to freely share any research publications that were the result of taxpayer support 31 The An tel man study of open access publishing found that in philosophy political science electrical and electronic engineering and mathematics open access papers had a greater research impact 32 A random is ed trial found an increase in content downloads of open access papers with no citation advantage over subscription access one year after publication 33 The NIH policy and open access repository work has inspired a 2013 presidential directive which has sparked action in other federal agencies as well In March 2020 PubMed Central accelerated its deposit procedures for the full text of publications on coronavirus The NLM did so upon request from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and international scientists to improve access for scientists healthcare providers data mining innovators A I healthcare researchers and the general public 34 The PM CID PubMed Central identifier also known as the PM C reference number is a bibliographic identifier for the PubMed Central open access database much like the PMID is the bibliographic identifier for the PubMed database The two identifiers are distinct however It consists of PM C followed by a string of numbers The format is 35 Authors applying for NIH awards must include the PM CID in their application citation needed",
