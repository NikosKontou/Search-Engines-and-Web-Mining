and broadcast as many as 3 000 TV commercials 6 213 In 1957 the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications issued the Basic Guidelines for the Frequency Allocation Plan for Television Broadcasting

emperor and M ichi ko M asada and broadcast a special program that lasted 15 hours and 41 minutes 6 27 This wedding was also an important opportunity for television's popularity to skyrocket in Japan 6 27 At the beginning of the broadcast because most old style TVs could only receive channels up to channel 6 certain viewers were unable to watch Fuji TV as it was on channel 8 which became its weakness 6 21 For this reason Fuji TV actively negotiated with home appliance companies enabling mass production of 12 channel VHF band receivers 6 21 On June 23 1959 Fuji TV signed a program exchange agreement with Kansai TV To kai TV and KBC Television This was the beginning of Fuji TV starting to build its own network 6 7 One year after it started broadcasting the ratings of Fuji TV have kept

station in Japan to achieve all day broadcasting except for the late night period 6 43 Fuji TV also actively participated in the broadcast of the 1964 Summer Olympics 6 63 Since Fuji TV had a strong financial background during its establishment there was no trade union for a long time 6 77 It was not until 1966 that Fuji TV established a labor union and proposed to abolish the 25 year old

and Fuji TV also became a member of the group One of the core enterprises 6 95 In 1969 Fuji TV celebrated its 10 th anniversary For this reason Fuji TV broadcast a series of special programs from February 24 to March 2 of this year and won the first place in the ratings this week 6 99 Fuji TV's network continued to expand in the 1960 s In April 1970 FN S joined Delta 27 becoming one of the largest private TV networks in Japan 6 109 At the same time in order to reduce program production costs and cope with the growing strength of labor unions Fuji TV decided on the policy of separation of production and broadcasting in September 1970 and transferred the program production department to several subordinate production companies 6 115 However this measure did not bring success in ratings forcing Fuji TV to abolish this system in 1980 6 153 Before the early 1970 s except for Tokyo Channel 12 which was converted into a genera list TV station at the latest the ratings pattern at that time was described as three strong TBS Nippon TV Fuji TV and one weak NET TV 6 153 However after the mid 1970 s as the ratings of TBS and Nippon TV rose Fuji TV fell into a slump in ratings and the competition in the TV industry became two strong TBS Nippon TV and two weak Fuji TV NET TV 6 153 For this reason Fuji Television carried out a thorough budget cut in the late 1970 s 6 154 On the other hand in addition to the main business of TV Fuji TV began to diversify its operations during this period and gradually increased its involvement in fields In 1974 as part of the commemorative

chairman of Fuji Television resigned in 1980 Haru o Kau chi at Fuji Television's stand has completed a series of large scale reforms Haru o Kana i's return to Fuji Television Station's caused Fuji TV to enter a paradigm shift changing its slogan from the hardline conservative Mother and Child's Fuji Television to It's not TV if it's not fun 6 172 In 1981 Fuji Television had programming readjustments to match the new policies Among them were the ending of celebrity interview program Star's 1001 Nights and a reorganization of the late afternoon schedule In the first week of July 1981 Fuji TV surpassed TBS's viewing rate enabling the channel to win the Triple Crown in ratings for the first time 6 175 In 1982 Fuji Television Station acquired the first core station and broke through

at the flagship stations 6 187 Investigated by Video Research TBS which exceeds the quality of Fuji Television climbs to the top of each television station in Japan and is displayed on Fuji Television

Channel 8 logo to the Eye logo used by the Fuji san kei Communications Group In 1986 and 1987 Fuji Television worked with Nintendo to create two games called All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros and Yume Ko jo Doki Doki Panic for the Famicom All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros was a retooled version of Super Mario Bros with some minor changes such as normal levels being replaced with levels from Super

released a year later In October 1987 Fuji Television began branding their late night early morning slots collectively as JO CX TV 2 meaning alternative JO CX TV in an effort to market the traditionally unprofitable time slots and give opportunities to young creators to express their new ideas JO CX TV 2 featured numerous experimental programs on low budgets under this and follow on brands a notable example being Zu ii kin ' English which first aired in spring 1992 The JO CX TV 2 branding itself was changed in October 1989 to JO CX TV which lasted until September 1991 when it was replaced with GARDEN JO CX MIDNIGHT in October 1991 Meanwhile Fuji Television helped produce only the third series of the British children's television programme Thomas the Tank Engine Friends now called Thomas Friends with its creator and producer Britt All croft The GARDEN JO CX MIDNIGHT branding lasted until September 1992 when it was replaced with the JUNGLE branding which lasted from

equipment needs of the digital TV and satellite TV era 6 249 However on the other hand Hiroaki Kau chi's solo production style was unsatisfactory inside Hiroaki Kagami and Hisashi Hie had a relationship between the two and the emergence of a split in the management of Fuji Television 10 26 27 E his a a pro Japanese group was appointed to the board of directors of the Japanese newspaper company which was held on July 21 1992 The next day Hiroaki Kana i left Nippon Broadcasting Fuji Television and the chairmanship of the company and the chairman of the Fuji Group 10 26 27 6 255 The underlying cause of the incident was also acquired by the 2005 Vitality Gate Trial However Fuji Television's high rise was born inside and Japan's bubble economy collapsed 6 264 At the same time preparations have been made for the launch of sales in the area of Fuji Television which was established in 1995 6 276 On March 10 1997 Fuji TV moved its headquarters from Kawa da cho Shinjuku to the

6 340 The following year Fuji TV regained the triple crown of ratings from Nippon TV after 11 years 6 348 However while the ratings are rising the peculiar situation that the parent company of Fuji TV and Nippon Broadcasting Corporation is smaller than its subsidiary company in 2003 Nippon Broadcasting Corporation held 34 1 of the shares of Fuji TV has also made Fuji TV become the leader of securities investment funds such as Murakami Fund The target of equity acquisition 6 340 Beginning in 2003 Fuji TV and securities investment funds launched a competition to purchase the equity of Japan Broadcasting Corporation 6 340 and eventually developed into the Live door turmoil in 2005 Since 2002 Fuji Television has co sponsored the Clarion Girl contest held annually to select a

service had over a million subscribers 13 On April 1 2006 Fuji Television split up the radio broadcasting and station license of Nippon Broadcasting System into a newly established company with the same name The remaining of the old Nippon Broadcasting System was dissolved into Fuji Television This resulted in the assets of Nippon Broadcasting System being transferred over to Fuji Television 14 On October 1 2008 Fuji Television restructured and became a certified broadcasting holding company Fuji Media Holdings Inc K abu shiki g aisha Fuji Media H rudi ng usu and the second incarnation of Fuji Television Network Inc took over the broadcasting business this was the first time a Japanese commercial broadcaster restructured into a holding company with a wholly owned subsidiary taking over the station operations 15 On July 24 2011 Fuji Television ended its analog signal 16 Fuji Television which broadcasts Formula One in Japan since 1987 is the only media sponsor of a Formula One Grand

suffered from sluggish ratings In 2011 Fuji TV's triple crown position in ratings was regained by Nippon Television and was surpassed by TV Asahi the following year with the ratings dropping to third place in the flagship stations 10 11 Poor ratings also affected business conditions Fuji TV's advertising revenue has been declining year by year since 2005 and was surpassed by Nippon Television in 2014 It lost its first position in the core bureau's advertising revenue after 30 years 10 11 In 2015 Nippon Television's turnover also exceeded that of Fuji Television 17 In order to reverse this situation Fuji TV promoted Chihiro Kameyama who has produced many popular TV series as president in 2013 18 After Kameyama took office as the president he stopped broadcasting It's not a big deal if you take the time to smile and other long running programs 19 and implemented measures such as a large scale personnel transfer of 1 000 people in an attempt to promote revitalization within the company 10 179 182 However these measures did not reverse the sluggish ratings 20 During the New Year's Eve week from 2015 to 2016 for the first time Fuji TV's evening prime time ratings were lower than those of Tokyo TV ranking last among the flagship stations 20 In 2016 Fuji TV's evening prime time ratings were surpassed by TBS again falling to fourth place in the flagship stations 21 However Fuji TV's sluggish ratings are also due to the phenomenon of TV disengagement which has led to a decline in overall TV ratings 22 23 24 real time ratings have declined but the proportion of time shifted ratings has increased 25 On the other hand Fuji TV ranks second in ratings among the 13 to 49 age group which is most valued by advertisers 26 Therefore Fuji TV has invested more resources in program production for young audiences to improve advertising effects 27 Fuji TV is also actively investing in the development of new media fields and FO D has become profitable 28 Fuji Media Holdings is also trying to make up for the negative impact of the downturn in the television sector by developing sectors other than television 29 Fuji TV began broadcasting the evening programs of its

regular board meeting on the 27 President Shimizu revealed February's revenue 90 loss due to companies stopping ads in response to the scandal as well as the unknown outlook for the April program reorganization period According to Fuji TV as of January 311 companies and organizations had their commercials replaced with public service announcements 37 President Shimizu responded to the press

apologized for running subtitles during a show earlier in the month that inaccurately described South Koreans interviewed on the street as saying they hate Japan The apology came after a successful online petition over the weekend with people stating the major broadcaster had fabricated the subtitles to breed anti Korean sentiment amongst the Japanese public Fuji TV explained that both interviewees indeed spoke of their dislike of Japan during the interviews but it accidentally ran clips that did not contain that message According to the broadcaster we aired these inaccurate clips because of a mix up during the editing process as well as our failure to check the final footage sufficiently 83 84 In 2016 a 32 year old Fuji Television Police reporter was indicted after straw purchasing an Audi sportscar on behalf of a Yamaguchi gum i affiliated yak uz a member The two had met over 20 times over a year dining at restaurants in central Tokyo In a statement Fuji TV said It

Angeles Dodgers coverage they along with Nippon TV gave very comprehensive coverage of Shohei Ohtani's Los Angeles home The coverage was widely panned as an invasion of Ohtani's privacy largely due to the aerial views of the property as well as interviews with various neighbors As a result the Dodgers revoked the media credentials of the two networks Both networks declined to respond to the situation 87 This also led to Ohtani selling his house and refusing a post game interview with them after the Dodgers went on to win the World Series that year 88 In October 2024 Fuji TV chose to cover the 2024 World Series in the US instead of the 2024 Japan Series which was a huge event in its own right This led to the Nip on Professional Baseball Organization stripping Fuji TV of press passes for the first two games of the 2024 Japan Series before it started on Oct 26 However for Television Nishi nippon Corporation TNC a local Fukuoka TV station affiliated with Fuji Network System

but was aware of it and chose not to publicize the matter out of respect for the woman's privacy and recovery He added that an investigative panel of lawyers would look into the issue 92 This came

current director and advisor of the company According to the answers given to questions regarding his absence Kano responded that the reason is because he is an advisor and that the responsibility for duties is mine and Minato's When asked if Hied a had made any statements to the effect that he would take responsibility he did not clarify saying there was nothing in particular that could be said Regarding if Hied a would resign he answered that he was not directly involved but we need to consider the underlying causes as well 111 During the press conference several topics were talked about About the case it had been known since June 2023 when the woman talked about it to a Fuji employee Due to the nature of the incident it was reported to executives officers and eventually the president only a few people in the company knew about it 112 Nakai himself reported the incident in July and Fuji hesitated to take on the case because an agreement between the parts had already taken place and a settlement was proceeding 112 President Minato became aware until August 113 Since then the woman was kept under watch regarding her health and recovery hoping she would return to work as soon as she could A formal investigation was not conducted regarding Nakai The reason given for this decision was that they feared that if they had started a formal investigation it would have a negative impact on the woman's care if more people found out So they did not immediately and actively conduct interviews Communication was difficult and to confirm delicate matters they could only communicate with the woman through and with her doctors and the idea was to wait until the situation stabilized 112 Regarding the involvement of one of their staff in the invitation of the female who was Nakai's victim in that day's event as reported by Bun shun Fuji has continued to deny it citing inquiries and interviews with Nakai and other employees and staff and to phone call records 113 but confirmed that that employee had indeed invited the woman to a barbeque in May held in Nakai's house In that occasion at least 10 people were at the gathering There was another gathering at a hotel in Tokyo in the winter of 2021 with Nakai and other people in the entertainment industry Fuji employees including the woman in question Neither of the latter two meetings have been considered as an extension of the barbeque nor has been revealed full confirmation of the reason for having the gathering 112 113 Regarding a question about considering female employees like announcers as entertainment staff Minato responded We do have dinner parties with celebrities and TV show participants New Year's parties and the like Sometimes female announcers join in on these I have never thought of them as entertainment staff and reiterated I have always thought of them as one of our colleagues attending a banquet together so I have never personally perceived them as entertainment staff 114 Regarding if they had considered filing some kind of claim for damages against Nakai Endo replied The third party committee has not yet reached a decision so as of now we have not When asked if there was a possibility he said The possibility may not be zero 115 On January 28 2025 it was reported that just before the Fuji press conference on the 27 Weekly Bun shun had changed wording of its electronic version of the post dated December 25 2024 omitting that the woman was invited to the incident day's dinner by a Fuji TV programming executive changing it to that the invitation was from Nakai as a continuation from a meeting that the executive had set up 116 117 118 35 37 37 75 N 139 46 29 47 E 35 6271528 N 139 7748528 E 35 6271528 139 7748528",
