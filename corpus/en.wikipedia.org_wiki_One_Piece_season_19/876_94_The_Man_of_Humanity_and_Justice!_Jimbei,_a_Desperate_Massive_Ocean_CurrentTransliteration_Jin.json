The Big Mom Pirates figure out what happened and quickly expose the Sunny again, but the Sun Pirates rise again to confront them. The crew is soon overwhelmed, and Luffy gives Jinbe permission to return and help his former crewmates, telling him to meet them at the Land ofWano. Jinbe goes to the Sun Pirates, and they create a current enabling the Straw Hats to escape from the Big Mom Pirates' fleet and leave Totto Land, as does Morgans and Stussy by hot air balloon. Morgans then tells Stussy his belief that one of the Worst Generation will become the next King of the Pirates.",
