Reiju then presses her mouth to Luffy's and sucks all the poison out of him, curing him. She and Yonji return to their ship, agreeing to not say anything about their encounter in order to ensure Sanji's wedding happens smoothly. Meanwhile, Aladdin sees the scene from underwater and reports the Straw Hats' presence to Jimbei.
