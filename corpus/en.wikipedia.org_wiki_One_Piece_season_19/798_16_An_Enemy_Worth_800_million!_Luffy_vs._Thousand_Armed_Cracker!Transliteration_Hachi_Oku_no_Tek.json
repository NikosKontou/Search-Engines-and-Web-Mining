Meanwhile, Nami and Pound are confronted by Brûlée and King Baum, and Brûlée tells Nami that other members of the Worst Generation had invaded their territory before, only to be quickly dealt with without even meeting Big Mom. Urouge had managed to defeat one of their Sweet Commanders, but was later taken out by Cracker. Brûlée then attacks Nami and tries to drag her into the Mirro-World, but Pound gains the resolve to attack his stepdaughter, branding himself an enemy of the Big Mom Pirates. However, Nami hits Brûlée with a thunderbolt and sends her falling back into Mirro-World, and Luffy continues to fight Cracker with determination.",
