Shirohige no Katami no Shugosha\" (Japanese:マルコ！白ひげの形見の守護者) Yusuke Suzuki Atsuhiro Tomioka June 23, 2019(2019-06-23)\n\nCat Viper and the Guardians reach Whitebeard's home island, where Whitebeard and Ace are buried. Cat Viper finds Marco in a hidden village where he works as a doctor. During the meeting, Marco tells Cat Viper about islands like Whitebeard's that can't pay for the Celestial Dragon's Heavenly Tribute aren't allowed to join the World Government, causing them to be under constant threat by pirates and kidnappers, often resulting in many children being orphaned. Whitebeard, being one such orphan, anonymously funneled any money he gathered to the restoration of his island. Marco also tells Cat Viper leave the island because Edward Weevil and his mother, Buckin, who used to be shipmates with Whitebeard nearly forty years ago, are looking for Whitebeard's treasure. Though unsure if Buckin's claims that Weevil is Whitebeard's biological son are true or not, Marco doubts they'll believe that the treasure no longer exists. Marco then asks Cat Viper to give Luffy a message but is shocked to learn that they're targeting Kaido.",
