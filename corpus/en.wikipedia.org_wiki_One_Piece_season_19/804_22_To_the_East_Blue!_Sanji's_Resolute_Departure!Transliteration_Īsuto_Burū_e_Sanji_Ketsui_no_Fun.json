Sanji's Resolute Departure!\"Transliteration: \"Īsuto Burū e Sanji Ketsui no Funade\" (Japanese:東の海へ サンジ決意の船出) Satoshi Itō Tomohiro Nakayama September 3, 2017(2017-09-03)\n\nSix months into his childhood imprisonment, Sanji remembers learning to cook and bringing food to his now-deceased mother against Judge's wishes. This motivates him to continue learning to cook in the dungeon and feed the rats, which his brothers eventually find him doing; on several occasions they attack him and Reiju helps treat his injuries afterwards. After Germa 66 climb up the Red Line en route to Kojia in the East Blue, Sanji tells Reiju about his wish to be a cook and she breaks him out. Judge finds Sanji retrieving the key to his face mask and asks Sanji to never mention being his son, but lets him escape. Reiju leads Sanji to a docked boat as Germa 66's attack begins. In the present, Sanji's face is swollen from a beating by his brothers.",
