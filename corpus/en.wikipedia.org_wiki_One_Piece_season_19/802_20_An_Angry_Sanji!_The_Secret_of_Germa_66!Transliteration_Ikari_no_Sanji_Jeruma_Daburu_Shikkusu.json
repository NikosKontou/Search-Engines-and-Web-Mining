As Luffy rests inside King Baum's mouth, Cracker catches up to the group, and in anger cuts off King Baum's top. Meanwhile, in the Mirro-World, Chopper and Carrot find out Sanji's location by spying through mirrors, unaware that Brûlée is hunting them down. In the Germa Kingdom, Niji beats up Cosette in retaliation for Sanji's actions, and Sanji becomes enraged when he finds Cosette. Yonji offers to take Sanji to Niji, and leads him to the kingdom's secret cloning facility, where he reveals that Germa 66's soldiers are bred through illegal cloning techniques that Judge worked on with Vegapunk. Sanji is appalled, but when Niji and Ichiji walk in, he wastes no time in kicking Niji in the face.",
