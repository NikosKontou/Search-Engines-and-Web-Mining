Yoshihiro Ueda Shōji Yonemura June 11, 2017(2017-06-11)\n\nNami, Chopper, and Carrot run from the anthropomorphic rabbit Randolph as he relentlessly attacks them, and also encounter a very large and strange man who is buried in the ground up to his neck. Unbeknownst to the trio, everything in the Seducing Woods is alive and trying to trap and kill them. Meanwhile, Sanji has arrived at his family's castle, where he reunites with Yonji. Yonji tries to berate his brother for trying to resist his arranged marriage, and the two's argument results in them attacking each other. Back in the forest, the Sanji Retrieval Team reunites with Luffy as they attempt to run back to the shore. However, each time they run to where they came from, they end up in the same clearing. They then realize that everything is alive, and the Luffy with them is revealed to be the mirror duplicate he was fighting earlier. Mirrored Luffy returns to her true appearance: the eighth daughter of the Charlotte Family, Charlotte Brûlée. Brûlée captures Nami and prepares to slice up her and Carrot's faces with her fingernails.",
