Meanwhile, Tamago tries to convince Sanji to join Big Mom but he refuses. When Vito shows him a picture of fiancée, Pudding, he is immediately love struck. However, Sanji ignores Vito and is angered when he is grouped in with Germa 66. After returning to his room, Sanji's refusal to co-operate and disrespect causes Gotti to try to attack him but is stopped by a woman, who seems familiar to Sanji. After passing through the storm and days without food, Luffy catches a giant fish while people on a sail ship begin looking for someone.",
