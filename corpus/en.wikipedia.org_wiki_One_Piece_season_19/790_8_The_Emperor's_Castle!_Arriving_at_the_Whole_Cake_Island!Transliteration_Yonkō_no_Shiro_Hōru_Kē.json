His crew supported him, but Aladine's wife and Big Mom's daughter Charlotte Praline warned him that no one who tried to leave her mother's crew has emerged alive. In the present, Big Mom takes Jimbei to her castle, and seems fine with him leaving, but then says he will have to lose something in return. She then takes out a roulette wheel to determine what he will lose. As night falls, the Sanji Retrieval Team gets stuck in a sea of mizuame. While they try to free themselves, Pedro reveals that he once sailed with Pekoms as explorers looking for Poneglyphs. However, he met his defeat here, though is now returning because he knows how highly Duke Dogstorm and Master Cat Viper think of the Straw Hats. He now wants to help the Straw Hats get ahold of Big Mom's Road Poneglyph, and offers to sneak in and get it while the others rescue Sanji. The next morning, the team finally reaches Whole Cake Island. They approach the coast, and to their shock they see Sanji standing on it.",
