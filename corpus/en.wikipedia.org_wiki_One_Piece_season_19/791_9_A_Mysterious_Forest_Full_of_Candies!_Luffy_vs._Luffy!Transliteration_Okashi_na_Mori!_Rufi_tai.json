Rufi tai Rufi\" (Japanese:お菓子な森！ルフィＶＳルフィ) Kentarō Fujita Tomohiro Nakayama June 4, 2017(2017-06-04)\n\nWhile Pedro and Brook take the Shark Submerge III into Whole Cake Island to look for Big Mom's Road Poneglyph, the rest of the Sanji Retrieval Team makes landfall on the island. Despite seeing Sanji multiple times, they are forced to chase after him as he constantly runs away and eludes them. They end up inside a forest made mostly of sweets, and encounter a talking crocodile that nearly eats them. While they chase after Sanji, Luffy suddenly encounters a mirrored copy of himself that perfectly reflects his movements. Not knowing what is happening, Luffy attacks his duplicate, who counters with the exact same attacks.",
