Pedro fights Hiyoko and manages to defeat this form, but before Hiyoko regenerates into a stronger form, Pedro lights a string of bombs and attempts to take out all the surrounding enemies in a massive explosion. In the Room of Treasure, Brook's sword is unable to pierce Big Mom's skin, and he is finally defeated but not before managing to injure Prometheus. Outside the room, Smoothie hears about Luffy's breakout and orders the floors below them to be blocked off so Big Mom does not find out. Pudding then comes in and Big Mom reveals to Brook that she can awaken the ability to read the Ponegliffs with her third eye. Pudding asks Big Mom if they can talk in the latter's room. Below, Luffy fights against Charlotte Cadenza in his race to find Sanji and knocks out the pirate after choking him for Sanji's location. In the infirmary, Reiju encourages Sanji to escape and leave their family to die, revealing that she replaced the explosive cuffs on his wrists with duds.",
