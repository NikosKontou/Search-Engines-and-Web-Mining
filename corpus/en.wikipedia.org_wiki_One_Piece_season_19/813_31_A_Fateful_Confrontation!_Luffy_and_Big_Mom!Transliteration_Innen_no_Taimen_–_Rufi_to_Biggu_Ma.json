Big Mom asks Nami about Lola and is enraged to hear that she still considers Big Mom part of her family despite refusing a politically-motivated marriage and running away. Big Mom claims that Lola's wedding would have allowed her to already become King of the Pirates and demands her location from Nami in order to assassinate her. Disgusted by her pettiness, Luffy once again challenges Big Mom. In his quarters, Sanji tries to come to terms with his decision to leave the Straw Hats and vows to give Pudding a happy marriage. Pedro runs around the Treasure Repository taking out guards, making Big Mom assume that he is after the Tamate Box.",
