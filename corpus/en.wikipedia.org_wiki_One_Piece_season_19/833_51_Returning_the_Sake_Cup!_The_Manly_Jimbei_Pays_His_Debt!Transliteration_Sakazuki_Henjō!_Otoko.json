Following Bege's plan, Luffy goes after Carmel's photo. However, his attempt is thwarted by Katakuri using his Mochi Mochi Fruit ability. Jimbei steps in and saves Luffy from Katakuri's clutches and explains the latter ate the Mochi-Mochi Fruit. He then confronts Big Mom and declares his intention to leave her crew and join the Straw Hats. Big Mom then attempts to take Jimbei's lifespan, but his lack of fear towards her causes her powers to have no effect. As Big Mom attacks Jimbei in a fit of rage, Brook (disguised as Luffy) destroys the photo of Carmel.",
