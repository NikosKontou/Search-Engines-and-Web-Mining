Luffy and Jimbei defend themselves against the attacking Big Mom Pirates. Pudding attempts to shoot Sanji but fails, prompting Daifuku to attack him with his genie created by his Puff-Puff Fruit power, while Oven's Heat-Heat Fruit power holds off Pedro. As Bege's plan goes awry, Perospero traps the Vinsmokes in candy and they are held at gunpoint. Brook notices that Big Mom is not screaming because she is confused on what to be angry about. He then tells Luffy to show her the broken picture again, which Luffy prepares to do.",
