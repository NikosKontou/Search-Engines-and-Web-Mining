He then rests besides King Baum's corpse. Sanji later arrives and finds Luffy, who wakes up from the smell of Sanji's bento. Sanji gives the bento to Luffy, relieving his hunger, while Luffy becomes happy to see Sanji again. However, Sanji once again attempts to convince Luffy to leave without him, but calmly this time. This enrages Luffy, so he punches Sanji and forces him to say his true feelings. Sanji then tearfully admits that he wants to return to the Straw Hat Pirates but cannot abandon his family. Happy to hear Sanji's answer, Luffy decides to help him crash the wedding. Meanwhile, The third Sweet Commander, (Big Mom's second son) Katakuri arrives at the Whole Cake Chateau.",
