Judge then sacrifices one of his soldiers to get the jump on Sanji, defeating him. Reiju treats Sanji's wounds, and Judge has explosive cuffs placed on his son, forcing him to go through with the wedding with his cooking ability on the line. Meanwhile, Luffy continues racing through the Seducing Woods, and is attacked by the forest's anthropomorphic flora.
