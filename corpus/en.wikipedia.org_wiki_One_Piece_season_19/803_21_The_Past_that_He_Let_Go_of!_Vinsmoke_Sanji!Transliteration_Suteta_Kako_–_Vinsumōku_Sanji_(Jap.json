However, Luffy regains his Haki and rejoins the fray, taking Cracker by surprise with a Gear Second punch. In the Germa Kingdom, Sanji cannot continue fighting Niji due to the threat on Zeff, allowing Niji to pummel him. As his brothers stand over him, Sanji remembers his childhood in the Germa Kingdom. Judge had given him and his siblings superhuman abilities and had them train their skills, but Sanji continuously fell far behind his siblings' performances, causing him to be viciously bullied. Judge discovered that Sanji possessed no superhuman abilities after all, and he faked Sanji's death, locking his third son in a dungeon with an iron mask on to act like he never existed.",
