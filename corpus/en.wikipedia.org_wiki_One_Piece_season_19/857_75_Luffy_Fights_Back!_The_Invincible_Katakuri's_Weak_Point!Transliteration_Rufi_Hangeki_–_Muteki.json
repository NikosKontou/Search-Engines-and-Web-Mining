However, Luffy loses the upper hand when Katakuri regains his composure. Back at Cacao Island, Pound arrives at the Sweets Factory, wanting to see Chiffon, but when Oven arrives, he attacks Pound. Inside the factory, Brûlée speaks to Pudding through a Transponder Snail and informs her of the Straw Hats' plan to arrive at Cacao Island.",
