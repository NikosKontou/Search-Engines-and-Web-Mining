There, he is approached by his father Vinsmoke Judge, who confronts him over his scuffle with Yonji, which resulted in Yonji's face being bashed in. When Sanji gives him the cold shoulder, Judge challenges his estranged son to a duel. Sanji proves to unexpectedly be a match for his father, and as they fight he recalls being abused as a child by his brothers, which Judge did nothing to stop. Meanwhile, Luffy is hunted down by the anthropomorphic flora of the Seducing Woods as he searches for his teammates alone.",
