They then encounter Pudding being forced to try on wedding dresses, as well as Tamago, who reveals that the Big Mom Pirates know everything about the Sanji Retrieval Team's locations, with the exception of Brook and Pedro's. Meanwhile, on the northwestern coast of Whole Cake Island, Capone Bege stands with his wife, Big Mom's twenty-second daughter, Charlotte Chiffon (the woman Sanji saw before), their son Capone Pez and his crew as he prepares to shoot the captured Pekoms for not complying with his wishes. He then shoots Pekoms into shark-infested waters. In the Whole Cake Chateau, Big Mom meets with Caesar Clown, as she seeks to learn the result of the gigantification research she hired him to perform. Caesar, knowing that it was impossible and having blown Big Mom's funds on hedonism, lies that Luffy and Law stalled his research when they destroyed his lab. However, Big Mom reveals that she had her eldest son Charlotte Perospero make an identical lab out of candy with his Lick-Lick Fruit powers, and gives Caesar two weeks to complete the research, threatening to have Perospero turn him into candy otherwise. In the Seducing Woods, Luffy discovers duplicates of Sanji and Pudding that act like animals. He catches them and throws them in a pile, but to his great confusion finds more and more duplicates of his crewmates.",
