during Japan's Sengoku period who conquered most of Japan In April 2010 Oda married his longtime girlfriend May u 4 and their son Shintaro was born on October 1 2010 5 Originally scheduled for April 23 2011 the wedding was postponed due to the rescheduling of the World Championships 6 Their second son was born on January 5 2013 7 A third son was born in early autumn of 2016 and a daughter on October 22 2019 Oda trained in Osaka Japan with No riko Oda and in Barrie Ontario with Lee Bark ell 8 He trained in Canada three or four times a year for 1 months at a time 9 at the Mariposa School of Skating He also formerly trained in Hackensack New Jersey under coach Nikolai Moro zo v Oda is known for his jumps and his smooth flow across the ice with deep knee bend 10 In the 2001 2002 season Oda placed 4 th at the Japan Junior Championships He was invited to compete at the senior Japan Championships where he placed 16 th Oda made his Junior Grand Prix debut on the 2002 2003 IS U Junior Grand Prix circuit He won the silver medal in Slovakia behind Russian Alexander Shubin who would go on to win the Junior Grand Prix Final that season Oda finished 7 th at the event in Italy He won the bronze medal at Japan Junior Championships and was invited to the senior Japan Championships where he placed 4 th In the 2003 2004 season Oda won two medals on the 2003 2004 Junior Grand Prix and

on to win the 2005 World Junior Championships Oda turned senior for the 2005 2006 Olympic year when he was guaranteed a senior Grand Prix assignment after he won the World Junior Championships Oda made a splash immediately as a senior winning the bronze medal at his first event and winning the 2005 NHK Trophy over favorites compatriot Daisuke Takahashi and reigning world bronze medalist Evan Lysacek Oda qualified for the 2005 2006 Grand Prix Final where he placed fourth Takahashi and Oda the main contenders for Japan's sole men's Olympic spot both had very good Grand Prix seasons However since the selection criteria for the allocation of Olympic spots did not only consider the points calculated from the athletes ' top two international competition results of the 2005 2006 season and the 2005 06 Japanese Championships but also retained points from the 2004 2005 season 70 of the athlete's best international competition results Takahashi was the first choice for the Olympic berth even if he would not go on to win the final ranking competition the 2005 06 Japanese Championships 11 At the 2005 06 Japanese Championships Oda was initially declared the winner but his gold medal was revoked when a glitch in the calculation of scores in the event's computer system was discovered The reason for the error lay in Oda's first jump combination a combination of triple Axel triple toe loop and triple loop The last jump of the combination the triple loop was initially incorrectly identified as a double jump but was later corrected to an under rotated triple jump attempt This is where the Za yak rule came into play which says that in a free skate of all triple and quadruple jumps only two can be executed twice Oda had executed two triple toe loops and two triple Lutz es and since he had also executed a triple loop and the loop at the end of his first combination jump was corrected to an under rotated attempt at another triple he had executed three triple jumps twice As a result the score for the second triple lutz was invalidated The rankings were reversed and Takahashi was awarded the gold 11 However due to both skaters ' strong results during the 2005 2006 season the Japanese Skating Federation split the international assignments giving Takahashi the Olympic berth and Oda a place at the World Championships Oda placed fourth at his first senior World Championships earning Japan two spots to the 2007 Worlds The following season Oda placed 1 st at 2006 Skate America over American Evan Lysacek and he finished 2 nd at the 2006 NHK Trophy to compatriot Daisuke Takahashi He qualified for the Grand Prix Final and won the bronze medal At the Japan Championships Oda won the silver medal for the second consecutive year He went on to compete at the 2007

cast of an upcoming ice show in Japan 15 On August 2 2007 the Japan Skating Federation itself w racked by scandal 16 announced that it had suspended Oda from national competition until the end of

which he also won Oda was assigned to the 2008 NHK Trophy and won that as well Oda was not eligible for a second Grand Prix assignment and therefore could not qualify for the Grand Prix Final Oda won

the season at Worlds 22 Oda was assigned to the 2009 Troph e Eric Bompard and to the 2009 Cup of China in the 2009 2010 Grand Prix season winning both 21 He was the top qualifier for the Grand Prix Final where he claimed the silver medal behind Evan Lysacek At the 2010 Japanese National Championship sOda won the silver medal behind Daisuke Takahashi That placement earned him a spot to compete at

given three minutes to fix his boot with a two point penalty 23 Upon resuming the long program Oda landed a final double Axel and scored 153 69 in that segment of the event ultimately placing 7 th overall in men's singles 24 Oda then moved on to the 2010 World Championships where he was considered a medal contender However he had a short program in which he performed only single jumps and thus failed to qualify for the free skating portion of the event 25 Oda left his coach Nikolai Moro zo v at the end of the 2009 10 season 4 returning to former coach Lee Bark ell 26 For the 2010 11 Grand Prix season Oda was assigned to the 2010 Skate Canada International and to the 2010 Skate America He won the silver medal at both events finishing behind Patrick Chan at Skate Canada and Daisuke

season once again at the Ne bel horn Trophy winning the title for the second straight year During the Grand Prix series he took bronze at the 2013 Skate Canada and silver at the 2013 NHK Trophy He was named first alternate to the Grand Prix Final and was called up when his fellow countryman and the defending champion Daisuke Takahashi pulled out due to a leg injury 31 Oda won the bronze medal after placing third in both segments of the competition Oda finished fourth at the 2014 Japanese Nationals and was named to the 2014 Four Continents team He was not selected for the Olympic team due to

show H yoen starring his peer Daisuke Takahashi In April 2017 Oda accepted a job as head coach at the Kansai University Skating Club in Taka tsuki Osaka However Oda would step down from this position in September 2019 and in November 2019 he would hold a press conference claiming that his reason for resignation was due to fellow Kansai University coach Mie Hamada morally harassing him Shortly after that conference Oda would file a lawsuit against Hamada seeking 11 million yen in damages for mental distress 40 41 Oda further alleged that Hamada would yell at her students slam walls and water bottles to intimidate them and that there was even an incident where Hamada grabbed one of her female students by the ponytail and slammed her down on to the ice He would also explain that after expressing concerns to Hamada about her training methods Hamada became enraged and subsequently began ignoring him talking behind his back and spreading rumors spread about him According to Oda this type of treatment at the rink led to a deterioration in his mental health which was what led to him quitting his job at the Kansai University Skating Club There was a power balance between me and Coach Hamada Oda would explain And even though I was the manager I had no decision making power 41 40 Hamada would vehemently deny Oda's claims and counter sue Oda in response for defamation for what Oda publicly said about her during his press conference and on his blog A parent of one of the students training at the Kansai University Skating Club would claim that Oda would call students with poor grades worthless athletes and angrily tell children who came to train in Osaka from overseas to go back to their country This individual further claimed that Oda reduced another parent to tears saying that they were unfit to be a parent because of their child failing to say hello 42 41 In March 2023 Judge Aki toshi Matsumoto of the Osaka District Court would dismiss Oda's lawsuit and find Oda guilty for defaming Hamada As a result Oda was ordered to pay her 2 2 million yen 41 40 In November 2022 Oda announced his decision to return to competition after nine years of not competing Detailing his reasons for this decision Oda explained After the coronavirus outbreak my physical strength and muscle power dropped drastically and it was difficult to get it back I still want to skate in ice shows I can't continue like this I want to improve my physical strength muscle power and technique I wanted motivation Whenever there is a competition I train seriously 43 Oda made his official return in January 2023 at the 2023 Japan Winter Sports Festival where finished ninth The following season Oda would continue competing in domestic events 44 In spring 2023 Oda was cast to play Us opp in the summer show One Piece on Ice 45 Oda would then announce his intention to officially retire following the 2024 25 figure skating season In November 2024 he would win the Japan Western Sectional Championships which allowed him to qualify for the 2024 25 Japan Championships 46 Receiving standing ovations for both his short and free program performances Oda would ultimately come in fourth place the same placement he achieved at the previous national championships he competed at eleven years prior 47 Following the event Oda expressed gratitude towards the fans and said I'm glad I came back I've had a rich skating life 44 48 49 He subsequently confirmed his official retirement from competitive figure skating 50 Y M C A Media related to No bun ari Oda at Wikimedia Commons",
