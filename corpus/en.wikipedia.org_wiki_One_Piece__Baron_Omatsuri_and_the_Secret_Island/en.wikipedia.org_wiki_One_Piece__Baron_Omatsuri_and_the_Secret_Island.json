    "transformers_text": "One Piece: Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island ( Japanese : ONE PIECE THE MOVIE オマツリ男爵と秘密の島 , Hepburn : Wan Pīsu za Mūbī Omatsuri Danshaku to Himitsu no Shima ) is a 2005 anime film directed by Mamoru Hosoda and produced by Toei Animation . It is the sixth animated feature film of the One Piece film series , based on the manga of the same name written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda . It premiered in Japan on March 5, 2005, and was released to DVD on July 21, 2005. [ 2 ]\n\nOne Piece: Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island is considered one of the darkest of the One Piece films, due to its more serious tone and disturbing subject matter. Director Mamoru Hosoda would later found Studio Chizu and produce acclaimed films of this style. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]\n\nThe Straw Hats receive an invitation to an island resort on the Grand Line run by Baron Omatsuri, and the crew travels to the island intent on relaxing and having fun. The Baron welcomes them to the resort and encourages them to enjoy themselves, but only after they complete The Trials Of Hell . The crew is hesitant, but Luffy accepts the challenge. The Straw Hats (represented by Usopp) win the first trial, but the outraged Baron demands they compete in another challenge. Luffy, Chopper, and Robin wait at the resort while the rest of the crew participates in the second trial.\n\nRobin questions Muchigoro, one of Baron's crewmates, about a flower on the island. Muchigoro mentions something about the Lily Carnation being at the island's summit before running off. Luffy and Chopper wander off, both meeting other pirates who had previously arrived and participated in the trials. Luffy receives an ominous warning about Baron planning to split up his crew. Chopper learns about Baron's past, but right before he figures out the mystery, he is stricken with an arrow shot by Baron. The Straw Hats (represented by two pair of duos, Zoro/Sanji and Nami/Usopp) win the second trial, but rifts begin to grow between the crew members.\n\nThe crew notices Chopper is missing, but Baron interrupts them with a dinner party. The Baron notices Robin leaving, and she reveals to him that she was looking for the Lily Carnation. Baron reveals the flower's secret to Robin while Robin looks shocked. The Straw Hats realize that Chopper, Usopp, and Robin are gone. Arguments over who's to blame for their disappearances ensue before Baron announces the final trial. Tension between the crew results in the crew splitting up. The island was revealed to be a trap where Baron raises tensions between pirate crews before killing them by feeding the crew to the Lily Carnation, a flower of reincarnation, which gives life to Baron's crew. Luffy fights Baron after knowing the truth about the Lily Carnation, demanding Baron to return his crew. After a difficult and traumatizing battle, Luffy kills Baron with a single punch, saving his crew from the Lily Carnation.\n\nBaron cries for his friends that were lost and how he is alone. He had been fooling himself for years with the false constructs of his crew created by the Lily Carnation. Each of his dead crewmates speak with him, telling him that they were happy to be remembered, but not with his corrupted charade. They apologize for leaving him alone for so long but believe it would be for the best if he forgets the night they died and finds new friends. Luffy lays exhausted on the ground while the crew all appear unharmed with no memory of the incident. The Straw Hats gather around Luffy, wondering how he can sleep in such a place, and Luffy laughs.\n\nThe animation in this film is very different from the television series, using the style often seen in Mamoru Hosoda's films. Some of the later episodes use styles similar to those seen in this film.\n\nTatsuya Hamazaki adapted the film's story into a 228 pages light novel , released on March 14, 2005. [ 5 ]\n\nDirected by Mamoru Hoshoda, the film was animated by Toei Animation and scored by Kohei Tanaka. In Japan, it released on March 5, 2005. It later received a limited theatrical release in select countries and became available on home video and streaming platforms worldwide.\n\nThe film had a six-week run in the Top 10 of the Japanese box office. It made third place in its first week, fourth place in its second week, followed by two weeks at sixth place, fifth place in its fifth week, and seventh place in the sixth week. [ 6 ]\n\nThe film received mixed-to-positive reviews. Anime News Network praised its darker tone as \"refreshing yet unsettling\", while others criticized the departure from the series' usual style. It has since been acknowledged as one of the boldest One Piece films, influencing later adaptations and gaining a cult following.",
