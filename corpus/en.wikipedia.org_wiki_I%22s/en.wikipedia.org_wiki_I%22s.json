    "transformers_text": "I\"s is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masakazu Katsura . It follows Ichitaka Seto, a high school student who is in love with his classmate Iori Yoshizuki, but is too shy to tell her. Again and again he plans to tell her his true feelings, but each time something (usually a misunderstanding of some kind) gets in the way. Things become even more complicated when Itsuki Akiba returns to Japan; she is a girl Ichitaka was friends with in their childhood before she moved to the United States, and who had a huge crush on him.\n\nI\"s was serialized in Shueisha 's Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1997 to 2000, with its chapters collected into 15 tankōbon volumes. It was adapted into a two-episode original video animation (OVA), titled From I\"s , in 2002, and a six-part OVA, called I\"s Pure , which was released in 2005 and 2006. The manga and both OVAs were licensed in North America by Viz Media . The manga was released from April 2005 to September 2007, while the OVAs were released as a box set in March 2009. By 2008, the I\"s manga had over 10 million copies in circulation.\n\nI\"s , written and illustrated by Masakazu Katsura , was serialized in the shōnen manga anthology Weekly Shōnen Jump from April 21, 1997 to May 29, 2000. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Publisher Shueisha collected the 143 chapters into 15 tankōbon volumes. The manga was licensed in North America by Viz Media, and was released from April 15, 2005 to September 4, 2007. However, Viz censored their releases in order to, as they stated, \"fit the criteria of audiences in the U.S.\". All edits were done to conceal nudity, specifically characters' breasts, and were made with the approval of Katsura. [ 4 ] However, as of the 13th through 15th volumes, the censorship of nudity has ceased. Jason Thompson declared the edits one of \"The Greatest Censorship Fails\" in manga. [ 5 ]\n\nThe manga was adapted into two original video animation (OVA) series, From I\"s in 2002 and I\"s Pure , which was released in 2005 and 2006. The OVA generally follows the main plot of the manga, but due to the shorter nature of the OVA, few of the main characters play a less prominent role (for example, Itsuki only lasts three episodes before her departure and Izumi only appears in the beach storyline arc from manga volume 8) and others such as Jun and Aiko are omitted altogether. Due to the missing characters, there are many situations in the OVA that follow the plot in the manga but are played out by different characters. In addition to the manga, Viz Media also licensed both OVA series and released them in North America as a box-set on March 24, 2009. [ 36 ] (North American DVD release UPC: 782009240099)\n\nFrom I\"s ( フロムアイズ , Furomu Aizu ) is the first OVA based on I\"s , consisting of two 30-minute episodes, released December 9, 2002 and March 19, 2003, respectively. A box set containing both episodes as well as a making-of documentary on a third DVD, was released on March 25, 2004. The story of From I\"s is not an adaptation of a story from the manga, but a new story set during the characters' summer holidays.\n\nI\"s Pure is the second OVA based on I\"s , a 6-episode OVA series animated by ARMS, produced by Pierrot , and released on DVD in Japan by Liverpool. There is also a DVD volume 0 containing promotional and background material. The series is a heavily abridged retelling of the major events in volumes 1 to 15.\n\nA Japanese television drama adaptation aired between December 21, 2018 and April 26, 2019 on SKY PerfecTV! 's SkyPer! channel. [ 37 ] It starred Amane Okayama as Ichitaka Seto, and Sei Shiraishi as Iori Yoshizuki. Kyoka Shibata played Itsuki Akiba, and Minori Hagiwara played Izumi Isozaki.\n\nA video game titled I\"s Pure , based on the OVA series of the same name, was released on November 9, 2006 for the PlayStation 2 in Japan.\n\nAdditionally, despite being a romantic dramedy , four characters from I\"s (Iori, Itsuki, Ichitaka and Izumi) are featured in Jump Ultimate Stars , a fighting game featuring many characters from popular Shōnen Jump series. None of the I\"s characters fight directly, however, and simply serve a support role for other characters.\n\nBy 2008, the I''s manga had over 10 million copies in circulation. [ 38 ]",
