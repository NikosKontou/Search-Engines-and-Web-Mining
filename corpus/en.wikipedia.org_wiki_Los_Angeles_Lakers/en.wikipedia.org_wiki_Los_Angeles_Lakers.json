three times in the 1980 s The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990 s but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987 with the Celtics winning the series 4 2 They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals which the Lakers won in 7 games The two teams were tied for the highest number of championships with 17 titles a piece until the Celtics surpassed this record in the 2024 NBA Finals together the 35 championships account for almost half of the 78 championships in NBA

five games The Lakers have a lengthy history with the Golden State Warriors as both franchises relocated to California during the early 1960 s Geography does play a minor role in the rivalry however

time regular season series 262 173 and the postseason series 25 11 315 316 The rivalry between the Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers is unique because they were the only two NBA teams to share an arena the Crypto com Arena but since the Clippers ' move to Intuit Dome in 2024 no NBA teams share an arena It is also one of only two intra city rivalries in the NBA the other being the new crosstown rivalry between the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets Los Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers 317 318 Some contend that the term rivalry was inaccurate until the Clippers became more successful 319 The Lakers and the Phoenix Suns rivalry didn't develop until the 2000 s where the teams were led by Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash respectively The San Antonio Spurs and the Lakers developed what some would classify as a rivalry in the late 1990 s and early 2000 s Since 1999 the teams have met in the NBA Playoffs five times with the clubs combining to appear in seven consecutive NBA Finals from 1999 to 2005 Additionally the teams combined to win five NBA championships from 1999 to 2003 the Spurs won the NBA championship in 1999 2003 2005 2007 and 2014 while the Lakers won the championship in 2000 2001 2002 2009 and 2010 From 1999 to 2004 the clubs ' rivalry was often considered the premier rivalry in the NBA 320 and each time the clubs faced each other in the playoffs the winner advanced to the NBA Finals In 2008 the teams met again in the Western Conference Finals where the Spurs were handily defeated only to beat the Lakers when they met again in 2013 The Kings and the Lakers have faced each other in the playoffs nine times between 1949 and 2002 and since the Kings moved to Sacramento in 1985 both have been based in California The 2002 Western Conference Finals

name from the Gems to the Lakers 12 General manager Max Winter bought a third of the club in their early years and sold his share to Mik an in 1954 Berger bought Mik an's share in 1956 giving him a controlling two thirds interest 322 After Mik an retired attendance plummeted and the team lost money for several seasons leading the ownership group to put the team up for sale in 1957 323 Marty Marion a retired baseball player and manager and his business partner Milton F isch man attempted to purchase the team with the intention of moving the club to Kansas City Missouri 323 324 Mik an offered to mortgage his home in an attempt to buy the team and keep the club in Minnesota 325 Ultimately the Lakers were sold to a group of investors led by Bob Short 322 The team was sold to Short's group with the agreement that it would not be relocated to Kansas City but kept in Minnesota 326 Short's ownership group consisted of 117 Minnesota businesses and private citizens who amassed a total of 200 000 for the purchase 150 000 to buy the team and 50 000 to run it 322 By 1958 Short had become 80 owner of the team by buying out his partners 322 but the team was floundering Attendance remained poor and the NBA had put the Lakers on financial probation notifying them that if they did not meet certain ticket sales numbers they could be bought out by the league and relocated Short was forced to move the team to Los Angeles in 1960 the club had lost 60 000 in the first half of the 1959 60 season alone 327 The NBA's owners originally voted 7 1 against the move 328 When Short indicated that he might take the team to a new rival league that was developing however the owners held another vote that same day and allowed the relocation 8 0 329 Aided by Baylor's drawing power 330 331 and the new locale the team's finances improved when they arrived in LA 332 333 Short sold the team to Washington Redskins owner and publisher Jack Kent Cooke in 1965 for a then league record amount of 5 175 million 334 Short insisted the deal be conducted in cash as he was wary of Cooke so guards transported the money in a cart from one New York bank to another 335 Cooke was a more hands on owner than Short and overhauled the team's operations 336 He personally financed construction of the Forum in 1967 at a cost of 16 5 million 337 338 In 1979 Cooke who needed to raise money to fund a costly divorce 339 340 sold the Lakers the NHL's Los Angeles Kings the Forum and some real estate to real estate investor Jerry Buss for 67 5 million 341 of which the Lakers constituted 16 million 342 When Buss bought the team the Lakers had won only one title since moving to Los Angeles 342 In Buss ' 33 plus seasons in charge of the team the Lakers won ten NBA championships and sixteen

The trusts are set up to ensure that the family retains control of the team as no one sibling can sell their individual stake 350 However the team can be sold if four of the six siblings vote in favor 346 According to Jan ie Buss Drexel Jerry Buss ' children cannot necessarily pass on their full ownership rights to their own children meaning that control over the Lakers goes to the last man standing among the siblings 346 Following Jerry Buss ' death day to day control over the team was initially split between Jean ie Buss the official controlling owner and the head of business operations and Jim Buss basketball operations 350 In February 2017 Jean ie fired Jim after several disappointing seasons which triggered litigation over who controlled the Lakers 352 353 347 In March
