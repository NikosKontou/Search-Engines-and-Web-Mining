[ 1 ] It was made a national holiday by government decree in 1946.

[ 6 ]\n\nAccording to the Constitution of Indonesia Act Number 24 Year 2009 concerning the National Flag, National Language, State Symbols, and the National Anthem Article 7 paragraph 3, it obliges every citizen of Indonesia to fly the national flag in front of their houses as well as on public institutions, office buildings, educational institutions, and on private and public transportation facilities throughout the country, as well as on Indonesian diplomatic offices abroad, on the 17 August. [ 7 ] Nowadays, the government requests the public to fly the national flag for a whole month in August (starting from the 1st till the 31st) to commemorate the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence of the country. [ 8 ] Many Indonesians did not know the obligation to raise the national flag, [ 9 ] and local authorities gave flags to residents and businesses that did not raise the flag. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ]\n\nIn August, community members also raise red and white pennant flags ( umbul-umbul ) and banners along streets and alleys and also decorate the community with shades of red and white as a representation of the colors of the national flag to celebrate and welcome the independence day, a custom which has been in practice for many years.

The guard of honour is provided by headquarters battalion of the National Armed Forces, all composed of military policemen and women, and the HQ Detachment of the National Police. As the president and vice-president enter the palace, the Ceremony Commander ( Komandan Upacara ), usually a colonel, leads the parade in the general salute to the president, followed by the remembrance of the proclamation of independence precisely at 10.00 AM accompanied by 17-gun salute fired from the National Monument (Monas) by the Indonesian Army 7th Field Artillery Battalion.
