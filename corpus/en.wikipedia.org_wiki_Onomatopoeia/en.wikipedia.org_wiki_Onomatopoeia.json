    "transformers_text": "Onomatopoeia or rarely echo is m 1 is a type of word or the process of creating a word that phonetically imitates resembles or suggests the sound that it describes Common onomatopoeia s in English include animal noises such as oink meow roar and chirp among other sounds such as beep or hiccup Onomatopoeia can differ by language it conforms to some extent to the broader linguistic system 2 3 Hence the sound of a clock may be expressed variously across languages a stick to ck in English tic tac in Spanish and Italian see photo d d in Mandarin kachi kachi in Japanese or ik ik in Hindi Urdu and Bengali The word onomatopoeia with rarer spelling variants like on oma to pei a and on oma top i a is an English word from the Ancient Greek compound on oma to poi a meaning ' name making ' composed of noma meaning name 4 and poi meaning making 5 6 It is pronounced n m t pi m t 7 8 Words that imitate sounds can thus be said to be onomatopoeic on oma to poetic 9 imitative 10 or echo ic In the case of a frog croaking the spelling may vary because different frog species around the world make different sounds Ancient Greek bre keke k ex koa x koa x only in Aristophanes ' comic play The Frogs probably for marsh frogs English rib bit for species of frog found in North America English verb croak for the common frog 11 Some other very common English language examples are hiccup zoom bang beep moo and splash Machines and their sounds are also often described with onomatopoeia honk or beep beep for the horn of an automobile and v room orb rum for the internal combustion engine In speaking of a mishap involving an audible arcing of electricity the word zap is often used and its use has been extended to describe non auditory effects of interference Human sounds sometimes provide instances of onomatopoeia as when mw a his used to represent a kiss 12 For animal sounds words like quack duck moo cow bark or woof dog roar lion meow miaow or purr cat cluck chicken and baa sheep are typically used in English both as nouns and as verbs Some languages flexibly integrate onomatopoeic words into their structure This may evolve into a new word up to the point that the process is no longer recognized as onomatopoeia One example is the English word bleat for sheep noise in medieval times it was pronounced approximately as blair t but without an R component orb let with the vowel drawled which more closely resembles a sheep noise than the modern pronunciation An example of the opposite case is cuckoo which due to continuous familiarity with the bird noise down the centuries has kept approximately the same pronunciation as in Anglo Saxon times and its vowels have not changed as they have in the word furrow Verb a dice ndi ' words of saying ' are a method of integrating onomatopoeic words and ideo phones into grammar Sometimes things are named from the sounds they make In English for example there is the universal fastener which is named for the sound it makes the zip in the UK or zipper in the U S Many birds are named after their calls such as the bobwhite quail the we ero the more pork the killdeer chickadees and jays the cuckoo the chi ff chaff the whooping crane the whip poor will and the kookaburra In Tamil and Malayalam the word for crow is k k This practice is especially common in certain languages such as M ori and so in names of animals borrowed from these languages Although a particular sound is heard similarly by people of different cultures it is often expressed through the use of different phonetic strings in different languages For example the snip of a pair of scissors is cri cri in Italian 13 ri qui ri qui in Spanish 13 terre terre 13 or tre que tre que citation needed in Portuguese kr its kr its in modern Greek 13 c k c kin Albanian citation needed and ka r ka r in Hindi citation needed Similarly the honk of a car's horn is ba ba Han in Mandarin tut tut in French pu pu in Japanese b bang b bang in Korean b rt b rt in Norwegian f om f om in Portuguese and bim bim in Vietnamese citation needed An onomatopoeic effect can also be produced in a phrase or word string with the help of alliteration and consonance alone without using any onomatopoeic words The most famous example is the phrase furrow followed free in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner The words followed and free are not onomatopoeic in themselves but in conjunction with furrow they reproduce the sound of ripples following in the wake of a speeding ship Similarly alliteration has been used in the line as the surf surged up the sun swept shore to recreate the sound of breaking waves in the poem I She and the Sea Comic strips and comic books make extensive use of onomatopoeia often being visually integrated into the images so that the drawing style emphasizes the sound Popular culture historian Tim DeForest noted the impact of writer artist Roy Crane 1901 1977 the creator of Captain Easy and Buz Sawyer In 2002 DC Comics introduced a villain named Onomatopoeia an athlete martial artist and weapons expert who is known to verbally speak sounds i e to voice onomatopoeic words such as crash and snap out loud to accompany the applicable event Advertising uses onomatopoeia for mnemonic purposes so that consumers will remember their products as in Alka Seltzer's Plop plop fizz fizz Oh what

and closing give sTic Tacit s name citation needed In many of the world's languages onomatopoeic like words are used to describe phenomena beyond the purely audit ive Japanese often uses such words to describe feelings or figurative expressions about objects or concepts For instance Japanese bara bara is used to reflect an object's state of disarray or separation and shii in is the on oma to poetic form of absolute silence used at the time an English speaker might expect to hear the sound of crickets chirping or a pin dropping in a silent room or someone coughing In Albanian tartar ec is used to describe someone who is hasty It is used in English as well with terms like bling which describes the glinting of light on things like gold chrome or precious stones In Japanese kir akira is used for glittery things A key component of language is its arbitrariness and what a word can represent clarification needed as a word is a sound created by humans with attached meaning to said sound 17 It is not possible to determine the meaning of a word purely by how it sounds However in onomatopoeic words these sounds are much less arbitrary they are connected in their imitation of other objects or sounds in nature Vocal sounds in the imitation of natural sounds does not necessarily gain meaning but can gain symbolic meaning clarification needed 18 An example of this sound symbolism in the English language is the use of words starting with sn Some of these words symbolize concepts related to the nose sneeze s not snore This does not mean that all words with that sound relate to the nose but at some level we recognize a sort of symbolism associated with the sound itself Onomatopoeia while a facet of language is also in a sense outside of the confines of language 19 In linguistics onomatopoeia is described as the connection or symbolism of a sound that is interpreted and reproduced within the context of a language usually out of mimicry of a sound 20 It is a figure of speech in a sense Considered a vague term on its own there are a few varying defining factors in classifying onomatopoeia In one manner it is defined simply as the imitation of some kind of non vocal sound using the vocal sounds of a language like the hum of a bee being imitated with a buzz sound In another sense it is described as the phenomena of making a new word entirely Onomatopoeia works in the sense of symbolizing an idea in a phonological context not necessarily constituting a direct meaningful word in the process 21 The symbolic properties of a sound in a word or a phoneme is related to a sound in an environment and are restricted in part by a language's own phonetic inventory hence why many languages can have distinct onomatopoeia for the same natural sound Depending on a language's connection to a sound's meaning that language's onomatopoeia inventory can differ proportionally For example a language like English generally holds little symbolic representation when it comes to sounds which is the reason English tends to have a smaller representation of sound mimicry than a language like Japanese which overall has a much higher amount of symbolism related to the sounds of the language In ancient Greek philosophy onomatopoeia was used as evidence for how natural a language was it was theorized that language itself was derived from natural sounds in the world around us Symbolism in sounds was seen as deriving from this 22 Some linguists hold that onomatopoeia may have been the first form of human language 19 When first exposed to sound and communication humans are biologically inclined to mimic the sounds they hear whether they are actual pieces of language or other natural sounds 23 Early on in development an infant will vary his her utterances between sounds that are well established within the phonetic range of the language s most heavily spoken in their environment which may be called tame onomatopoeia and the full range of sounds that the vocal tract can produce or wild onomatopoeia 21 As one begins to acquire one's first language the proportion of wild onomatopoeia reduces in favor of sounds which are congruent with those of the language they are acquiring During the native language acquisition period it has been documented that infants may react strongly to the more wild speech features to which they are exposed compared to more tame and familiar speech features But the results of such tests are inconclusive In the context of language acquisition sound symbolism has been shown to play an important role 18 The association of foreign words to subjects and how they relate to general objects such as the association of the words take te and ba luma with either a round or angular shape has been tested to see how languages symbolize sounds The Japanese language has a large inventory of ideo phone words that are symbolic sounds These are used in contexts ranging from day to day conversation to serious news 24 These words fall into four categories The two former correspond directly to the concept of onomatopoeia while the two latter are similar to onomatopoeia in that they are intended to represent a concept mimetic ally and per formative ly rather than referential ly but different from onomatopoeia in that they aren't just imitative of sounds For example shi into represents something being silent just as how an anglophone might say clatter crash bang to represent something being noisy That representative or per formative aspect is the similarity to onomatopoeia Sometimes Japanese onomatopoeia produces re duplicated words 22 As in Japanese onomatopoeia in Hebrew sometimes produces re duplicated verbs 25 208 There is a documented correlation within the Malay language of onomatopoeia that begin with the sound bu and the implication of something that is rounded as well as with the sound of lok within a word conveying curvature in such words like lok kel ok and tel ok ' locomotive ' ' cove ' and ' curve ' respectively 26 The Qur ' an written in Arabic documents instances of onomatopoeia 19 Of about 77 701 words there are nine words that are onomatopoeic three are animal sounds e g mooing two are sounds of nature e g thunder and four that are human sounds e g whisper or groan There is wide array of objects and animals in the Albanian language that have been named after the sound they produce Such onomatopoeic words are s hk reps e matches named after the distinct sound of friction and ignition of the match head take tu ke ashtray mimicking the sound it makes when placed on a table shi rain

fast d hak d hak to represent fear with the sound of fast beating heart ip ip to signify a leaky tap etc Movement of animals or objects is also sometimes represented with onomatopoeic words like bh in
