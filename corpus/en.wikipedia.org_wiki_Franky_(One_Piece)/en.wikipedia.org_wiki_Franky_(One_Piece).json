shape shift depending on what kind of ali ment he consumes due to his cyborg abilities During his childhood years he possessed a normal physique which he has slowly technologically modified in time In

independent man with frequent disregard for rules and traditions Nevertheless his behavior is strange and comical He has proven to be among the most matured and trusted Straw Hats by trying to make his younger comrades laugh while thinking of important things at back of his mind This honest attitude makes him find friends even in the most unlikely places such as street urchins or pirates Many

has done to his body over time Franky possesses incredible superhuman strength His years as a shipwright as well as a pre pirate bounty hunter seem to have contributed greatly to his formidable
