Inflation and interest rates stayed low and steady throughout the decade, gross world product grew from 2010 to 2019. Global economic recovery accelerated during the latter half of the decade, fueled by strong economic growth in many countries, robust consumer spending , increased investment in infrastructure , and the emergence of new technologies . However, the recovery developed unevenly. Socioeconomic crises in some countries—particularly in the Arab world —triggered political revolutions in Tunisia , Egypt , and Bahrain as well as civil wars in Libya , Syria , and Yemen in a regional phenomenon that was commonly referred to as the Arab Spring . Meanwhile, Europe had to grapple with a debt crisis that was pronounced early in the decade. Shifting social attitudes saw LGBT rights make substantial progress throughout the decade, particularly in developed countries .\n\nThe decade saw the musical and cultural dominance of dance-pop , electronic dance music , hipster culture and electropop . Globalization and an increased demand for variety and personalisation in the face of music streaming services such as Spotify , SoundCloud and Apple Music created many musical subgenres. As the decade progressed, diversity was also seen with the mainstream success of K-pop , Latin music and trap . Superhero films became box office leaders, with Avengers: Endgame becoming the highest-grossing film of all time . Cable providers saw a decline in subscribers as cord cutters switched to lower cost online streaming services such as Netflix , Amazon Prime , Hulu and Disney+ . The video game industry continued to be dominated by Nintendo , Sony , and Microsoft ; while indie games became more popular, with Minecraft becoming the best-selling game of all time. Handheld console gaming revenue was overtaken by mobile gaming revenue in 2011. The best-selling book of this decade was Fifty Shades of Grey . Drake was named the top music artist of the decade in the U.S. by Billboard .
