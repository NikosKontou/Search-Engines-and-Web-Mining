    "transformers_text": "A dwarf pl dwarfs or dwarves is a type of supernatural short human shaped being in Germanic folklore Accounts of dwarfs vary significantly throughout history They are commonly but not exclusively presented as living in mountains or stones and being skilled craftsmen In early literary sources only males are explicitly referred to as dwarfs However they are described as having sisters and daughters while male and female dwarfs feature in later saga literature and folklore Dwarfs are sometimes described as short however scholars have noted that this is neither explicit nor relevant to their roles in the earliest sources Dwarfs continue to feature in modern popular culture such as in the works of J R R Tolkien and Terry Pratchett where they are often but not exclusively presented as distinct from elves The modern English noun dwarf descends from Old English d we org It has a variety of cognates in other Germanic languages including Old Norse d verg r Old Frisian d wer ch Middle Dutch d wer ch Middle Low German d wer ch and Old High German tw erg 1 2 The common Proto Germanic form is generally reconstructed as d wer gaz 1 3 A different etymology traces it to Proto Germanic dw ez gaz with the r sound being the product of Verner's Law clarification needed citation needed Linguist Anatoly Liber man connects the Germanic word with Modern English dizzy suggesting a link between the etymology and their role in inflicting mental diseases on humans similar to some other supernatural beings in Germanic folklore such a selves 4 Before the Proto Germanic stage the origin of the word dwarf is highly debated 3 Scholars in historical linguistics and comparative mythology have suggested that dwarfs may have started out as nature spirits beings linked to death or a blend of different concepts Some theories trace the word to the Proto Indo European root d he ur ' damage ' or to dh re ugh whence modern English ' dream ' and German T rug ' deception ' Scholars have also compared it to the Sanskrit d hvar as a type of ' demonic being ' 5 Alternatively linguist Guus K roo nen has suggested that it may derive from a verb dw erg an an ' to squeeze press ' which might be attested in Middle High German z we rgen 3 In Old English the use of d we org ' dwarf ' to designate a mythological being is not conclusively attested though it is assumed to have existed based on references to an illness attributed to a supernatural being A related Old English plant name d we or ge dw ost le pennyroyal might also suggest a belief in a dwarf related malady or a connection with warding off the being responsible Additionally early place names such as Due ride ne now D war ride n Dw eri house now D wer ry house and D wer ffe hole further hint at the presence of a supernatural concept of dwarfs often associated with subterranean spaces 2 Modern English has two plurals for the word dwarf dwarfs and dwarves Dwarfs remains the most commonly employed plural The minority plural dwarves was recorded as early as 1818 However it was later popularized by the fiction of philologist and legendarium author J R R Tolkien originating as a hyper corrective mistake It was employed by Tolkien for some time before 1917 6 Regarding his use of this plural Tolkien wrote in 1937 I am afraid it is just a piece of private bad grammar rather shocking in a philologist but I shall have to go with it 6 Scholars have noted that the Sv art l far ' black elves ' appear to be the same beings as dwarfs given that both are described in the Prose Edda as the residents of Sv art lf a he i mr 7 8 Another potential synonym is d kk l far ' dark elves ' however it is unclear whether sv art l far and d kk l far were considered the same at the time of the writing of the Prose Edda 9 The partial overlap of dwarfs in Ed dic sources with elves is supported by the names of dwarfs recorded in the D verga tal section of V lus p which include l fr ' Elf ' G and l fr ' Wand elf ' V in d lf ' Wind elf ' D verga tal further lists Y ngv i a name of the god Freyr who was given lf he i mr the home of the elves to rule according to Gr mn is m l 10 11 After the Christianisation of the Germanic peoples dwarfs continued in the folklore of Germanic speaking areas of Europe and the literary works produced there 18 Opinions on the degree of continuity in beliefs on dwarfs before and after Christianisation differ significantly Some scholars such as Rudolf Simek propose that the folk beliefs remained essentially intact in the transitional period making later sources exceedingly informative on pre Christian Germanic religion In contrast others such as Sch fk e argue that there is no resemblance between Ed dic and s kal dic dwarfs and those in later sources 5 19 Dwarfs feature throughout both for n aldar s gur and rid dar as gur In V l sunga saga which details the events that unfold after Loki extorts treasure out of the dwarf And var i to pay the wer gild for his killing of tr a being whose brother Reg in is also described in some sources as either resembling or being a dwarf 20 21 In Her vara r saga ok He i reks the sword Tyr fin g is forged and subsequently cursed by a dwarf named Dva linn and another named D ul in in the H auks b k manuscript 22 In German literature many dwarfs can make themselves invisible typically via a Tarn ka ppe cloak of invisibility which has been suggested to be an ancient attribute of dwarfs 23 Depending on the story they may be hostile or friendly to humans 24 The dwarf Alberich plays a vital role in the Nibelungenlied where he guards the Nibelung's treasure and has the strength of twelve men He is defeated by Siegfried and afterwards serves the hero In Or tn it Alberich seduces the Lombardy queen spawning the hero Or tn it The dwarf then aids Or tn it in his adventures after revealing to the hero that he is his father In Das Lied vom H r nen Sey f rid Siegfried is aided by the dwarf Eug el who is the son of the dwarf king Nibelung originator of the Nibelung's treasure citation needed The hero Dietrich von Bern is portrayed in adventures involving dwarfs In Lauri n he fights against the dwarf King Lauri nat the dwarf's magical rose garden He later rescues a woman whom Lauri n had kidnapped A similar plot occurs in the fragmentary poem Gold e mar In Virginal Dietrich rescues the dwarf queen Virginal from a force of invading heathens The dwarfs Egg erich and Bal dung play a role in aiding Dietrich in the poemS ige not Bal dung gives Dietrich a magical gem that prevents him from being bitten when thrown into a snake pit whereas Egg erich helps Dietrich and Hildebrand escape In the Helden buch Prosa a dwarf takes Dietrich out of this world after the death of all the other heroes a role given to Lauri n in some different versions of Dietrich's end citation needed Dwarfs feature in the modern folklore of Germanic speaking regions of Europe such as the Simon side Dwarfs in Northumberland who are sometimes believed to use lights to lure people off paths akin to a will o ' the wisp 25 26 Some dwarfs in modern folklore have been argued to belong to a broader group of smith beings living within hollow mountains or in caves such as the Grin ken sch mie d 27 These craftsmen can be referred to explicitly as dwarfs or terms that describe their roles such as Swedish bergs med ' mountain smith ' Mounds in Denmark can also be referred to by names derived from their inhabitants such as 's meds berg ' or 's meds hoi e ' ' smith's hill ' or ' smith's mound ' 28 Anglian folklore tells that one can hear a forge from within a mound and feel furnace fires under the earth while in Switzerland the heat can be attributed to the underground kitchens of dwarfs In one example the furnace's heat is believed to increase soil fertility 29 Rather than existing a true single nature of a dwarf they vary in their characteristics not only across regions and time but also between one another in the same cultural context Some are capable of changing their form entirely The scholar r mann Jakob s son notes that accounts of dwarfs in the Eddas and the section of Y ng linga saga regarding S ve ig ir lack prominence in their narratives and cohesive identity Based on this he puts forward the idea that dwarfs in these sources are set apart from other beings by their difficulty to be defined and generalised ultimately stemming from their intrinsic nature to be hidden and as the Other that stands in contrast with humans 30 Based on the etymology of dwarf it has been proposed that the oldest conception of a dwarf was as exclusively a formless spirit potentially as in the case of disease causing dwarfs however this view is not seen in the oldest manuscript accounts 32 In the quotation of V lus p in the Prose Edda the dwarfs emerge as beings with human form mann l kun while in the Codex Regius manuscript the first two dwarfs created either dwarfs or people with human forms 33 The prose of theY ng linga saga describes a dwarf sitting standing and speaking leading to the proposal that at the time of writing dwarfs were believed to at least sometimes have a human like form It nonetheless appears to have been recognised as a dwarf however that may have been due to its behaviour instead of its physical appearance 34 In sk aldi can dEd dic sources it has been noted that their roles are what define them rather than their physical appearance which has no significant relevance 35 Many dwarf names in Ed dic sources relate to light and brightness such as Dellingr ' the gleaming one ' and Gl inn ' glowing ' Stories do not explain these names but it has been theorised that they refer to the fires in the forges the dwarfs work or to haug a eldar ' grave mound fires ' that are found in later Icelandic folklore In contrast Snorri describes d kk l far which are typically identified as dwarfs as blacker than pitch 36 A lv s s is described by Thorin A lv s sm las being as unsuitable for wedding his daughter r ras he was pale about the nostrils and resembled a urs 37 In Middle High German heroic poetry most dwarfs have long beards but some may appear childish 38 In the early Old Norse sources dwarfs are typically described vaguely with no reference to them being particularly small in the legendary sagas and later folklore however they are often described as short 5 Nor ri Su ri A us tri and Vest ri are four dwarfs potentially depicted as four anthropomorphic figures on the hog back stone in Heysham in Lancashire that according to the Prose Edda each holds up a corner of the sky that was fashioned from the skull of Ymir It has been suggested that this would imply that dwarfs could be very tall however it has been noted that the sky could have been conceived of as being close to the earth at the horizon 39 Reg in a figure identified as either a dwarf or resembling a dwarf is a similar size to the hero Sigurd on both the Rams und carving and carvings from the Hyles tad Stave Church 31 Dwarf names in Ed dic sources include Full an gr ' tall enough ' and H r ' high ' however the terms are ambiguous and do not necessarily mean the dwarfs were conceived of as tall relative to a human 40 Some names suggest a small size such as Nori and Na bbi which have been translated as tiny and little nub respectively however it has been argued that this was not necessarily the general rule 41 Not all late sagas involving dwarfs describe their size but all that do describe them as short 42 In some German stories the dwarf takes on the attributes of a knight but is most clearly separated from normal humans by his small size in some cases only reaching up to the knees 43 Despite their small size dwarfs in these contexts typically have superhuman strength either by nature or through magical means 44 Anatoly Liber man suggests that dwarfs may have been initially thought of as lesser supernatural beings which became literal smallness after Christianisation 45 Diversity in appearance is not only seen between dwarfs throughout time and region but also with individual dwarfs who can be capable of changing their shape and size such as in Reg in sm l in which the dwarf And var i lived as a pike in the water due to curse from a Norn however could also take on a human like shape 46 In later German folklore the Zw erg k nig ' Dwarf King ' is a tiny being but is capable of becoming enormously tall at will 47 In Ed dic and s kal dic sources dwarfs are almost exclusively male for example in the D verga tal every dwarf named is male Some scholars have proposed that female dwarfs were not believed to exist however they are likely attested in charms dating to the early medieval period and are explicitly described in later saga material Dwarfs are also widely referenced in these sources as having family relations with others such as brothers and sons Pairs or groups of brothers are seen relatively abundantly in Ed dic contexts as with the sons of vald i and Fjalar r and Gal arr 48 The inscription on the 8 th century Ribe skull fragment has been interpreted by some scholars as explicitly referring to ad verg yn j a ' female dwarf ' that may have been believed to have been causing harm to the user of the fragment This interpretation is paralleled in Wi D we or h XC IIIb Against a Dwarf XC IIIb in which a harmful dwarf's sister is called to prevent him from causing an afflicted person's illness 49 50 In F fn is m l the worm F f nir refers to some Norns as Dva linn's daughters Old Norse Dva lins d tr 51 while in the Prose Edda they are described as of the dwarfs ' kin Old Norse d verga t tar note 1 52 As Norns are also female this could mean that dwarfs were conceived of by the author of the poem as able to be female it is not clear whether either their mother or mothers are dwarfs or if they themselves are considered dwarfs just because they are descended from dwarfs 53 It has been noted that it may not be that female dwarfs did not exist in the folklore of this period only that no explicit references to them survive in preserved narratives It has been proposed this may be because narratives typically centre on the gods rather than dwarfs and that female dwarfs were not conceived of as of great relevance to the gods given their primary interest in obtaining goods from dwarfs which does not depend on their gender Humans being of lower power and status cannot control dwarfs as easily and require alternative strategies to obtain treasures from them potentially explaining why female dwarfs are more prominent in saga literature 53 Female dwarfs feature in the late Gibbons saga B s a saga and j a lar J ns saga where they are referred to by the term dy rg j a In these cases female dwarfs are only mentioned alongside males and are not independently important to the plot Beyond S vama the named dy rg jain j a lar J ns saga the only other explicitly named dwarf woman in saga literature is the daughter of Sind ri in or steins saga V kings sonar Herr r 54 In saga material dwarf children are also seen In or steins saga V kings sonar and Egil s saga e in he nda ok s munda r berserk jab an a central characters help these children and are rewarded in return by the father with treasures Conversely in Sigur ar saga gla the human H lf dan is cursed after he throws a rock at a dwarf child breaking its jaw and is subsequently visited by the child's father in a dream who curses him H lf dan's brother later gives the child a gold ring to at one for the harm and is rewarded by the father once more in a dream Together this suggests that dwarfs could be conceived of as loving and protective of their children by the saga authors In or steins saga V kings sonar this family love is extended to the human H lf dan who develops a fostering relation with the dwarf Li tr likely with H lf dan as the foster son 55 In German heroic legend male dwarfs are often portrayed as lusting after human women In contrast female dwarfs seek to possess the male hero in the legends 56 In Ed dic sources dwarfs are attributed with creating magical treasures for the gods such as Mj l nir S if's hair Draupnir Gull in burst i Sk bla nir Gleipnir and Gung nir while in S rla t tr they craft Br singa men for Freyja 57 They further created the Mead of Poetry from the blood of Kv a sir which grants skill in poetry to those who drink from it According to Sk ldskaparm l due to the role of dwarfs in crafting the drink poetry can be referred to by kenning s such as the Billow of the Dwarf Crag Thought's Drink of the Rock Folk the Drink of Dva linn the Dwarves ' ship and the Ale of the Dwarves 58 59 John Lindow noted that stanza 10 of the Poetic Edda poem V lus p can be read as describing the creation of human forms from the earth and follows a catalogue of dwarf names he suggests that the poem may present Ask and Em bla as having been created by dwarfs with the three gods then giving them life 60 In Ed dic and some saga sources rather than being exchanged items of value move from dwarfs to others often through extortion This has been suggested to be a critical different i at or between dwarfs and elves in pre Christian Germanic religion who maintain reciprocal and positive relationships with gods and humans Kor maks saga describes how food was to be shared with elves to heal sickness and Aust rfa rar v sur records an lf abl t being held around the early 11 th century in Sweden Dwarfs on the other hand according to these sources are a social and there are no records of them receiving bl ts or other gifts in this period 61 Dwarfs maintain their roles as reluctant donors of their possessions in some later Old Norse legends such as Vol sunga saga and Her vara r saga ok He i reks where they are forced to give up And vara naut and Tyr fin g respectively Some legendary and romance sagas diverge from this with dwarfs acting friend lily and helpfully however this is attributed to their lateness and likely do not represent perceptions that predate Christianisation 62 Typically in these later sagas fighting dwarfs is considered dishonour able in contrast to other beings such as dragons Receiving help from a dwarf however such as being healed or given a treasure was not seen as problematic it has been proposed that the worldview of the saga writers was that a hero is not defined by achieving deeds alone but by being able to both give and accept help 63 In German legends they also possess other magical objects and often appear as master smiths 23 The Codex Regius version of V lus p records that dwarfs were produced out of the earth while in the Prose Edda they form like maggots in the flesh of Ymir which became the earth 64 Beyond this in early Old Norse sources there is ambiguity between whether dwarfs live within stones or whether they are themselves stones In V lus p they are referred to as ' masters of the rocks ' Old Norse v egg bergs v sir and s kal dic kenning s for ' stone ' include ' d verg rann ' ' house of the dwarf ' and ' D urn is ni j a sal r ' ' the hall of Dur nir's kinsman ' In Y ng linga tal stanza 2 and the accompanying prose in theY ng linga saga a dwarf lures King S ve ig ir into an open stone which closes behind them whereupon he is never seen again Y ng linga saga also describes this dwarf as being afraid of the sun Old Norse dag sk jar r akin to in A lv s sm l where the poem's eponymous dwarf is turned to stone by sunlight 65 66 67 In German legends they typically live inside of hollow mountains in some cases they may live above the ground 68 while in saga literature such as or steins saga V kings sonar they commonly live in individual stones which could also serve as workshops such as in the forging of Br singa men in S rla t tr 69 67 The presentation of dwarfs living within stones continued into modern folklore surrounding specific landscape features such as the Dwarf ie Stane a chambered tomb located on the island of Hoy and the D verga stein n in Sey is fj r ur 70 71 It has been proposed by Lotte Mot z that the in habitation of mountains stones and mounds by dwarfs may be derived from their earlier association with the dead who were frequently buried in mounds and around megaliths 72 The term ' d we org ' can be used in Old English texts to describe an illness it is commonly used in medical texts derived from Greek or Latin sources where it is used to gloss symptoms such as fever 73 The Dictionary of Old English divides the definition of Old English d we org into either a dwarf or pygmy or a fever however it has been argued that the distinction between the two meanings may not have been prevalent among Germanic peoples in the Early Middle Ages due to the close association between the beings and sickness in medicinal charms 74 The 8 th century Ribe skull fragment found in Jutland bears an inscription that calls for help from three beings including Odin against either one or two harmful dwarfs 75 76 The item's function has been compared to the Sig tuna amulet I and Canterbury charm that seek to drive away a lord of ursa r that is causing an infection the latter explicitly with the help of Thor 77 A similar inscription dating between the 8 th and 11 th century is found on a lead plaque discovered near Fakenham in Norfolk which reads dead is dwarf Old English dead is dw erg and has been interpreted as another example of a written charm aiming to rid the ill person of the disease identified as a dwarf 78 The Lac nun ga contains the Anglo Saxon charm Wi D we or hX C IIIb Against a Dwarf XC IIIb that refers to a sickness as ad we org that is riding the afflicted person like a horse similar to the harmful mare in the later folklore of the Germanic speaking peoples 79 Despite the Christian elements in the Wi D we or h charms such as the saints called upon for help their foundations likely lie in a shared North Sea Germanic tradition that includes inscribed runic charms such as those found in Ribe and Norfolk 80 The conception of diseases as being caused by projectiles from supernatural beings is widespread in Germanic folklore through time such as in the phenomenon of elf shot in Wi f rst ice where they are thrown by elves se and witches and in the Canterbury charm in which an infection is caused by the ' wound spear ' Old Norse s r vara used by the lord of ursa r 81 82 In the case of dwarfs this association has continued in places into the modern period such as in the Norwegian words d verg s kotor d verg sk ott which refer to an ' animal disease ' and translate literally as ' dwarf shot ' 25 83 Placenames derived from dwarf or cognate England Dwarfs feature in modern tellings of folklore such as Walt Disney's filmS now White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 based on the Snow White folktale retold by the Brothers Grimm 85 86 Most dwarfs in modern fantasy fiction closely follow those of J R R Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings where the dwarves Tolkien's spelling were distinguished from elves most modern fantasy has continued this distinction 87 Dwarfs are also present in other fantasy literature such as C S Lewis's Narnia stories Terry Pratchett's Discworld and the Artemis Fowl novels by Eoin Colfer 88 89 90 The emergence of fantasy video games has led to differing depictions and interpretations of dwarfs In the universe of The Elder Scrolls dwarves or Dw emer are presented as a race of subterranean elves whose culture was centred around science and engineering which differs from Tolkien's conceptual is ation in that they are not particularly short and are extinct Other games like Dragon Age and Warcraft present an image of dwarfs as stout bearded mountain dwellers separate from Elves citation needed",
