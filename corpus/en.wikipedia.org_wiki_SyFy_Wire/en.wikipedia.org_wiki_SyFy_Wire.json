The Prisoner In 1992 Ruben stein and Silvers sold the channel to USA Networks then a joint venture between Paramount Pictures and Universal Pictures 3 4 Ruben stein and Silvers became vice chairs of

television series Night Gallery along with Paramount's Star Trek television series Star Trek's creator Gene Roddenberry and author Isaac Asimov were recruited by Ruben stein and Silvers to serve on the initial advisory board 5 but both Roddenberry and Asimov had died by the time the channel finally launched on September 24 1992 Ruben stein recalled The first thing that was on the screen was '
