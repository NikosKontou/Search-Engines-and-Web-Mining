previous manga Hae niwa no Zigzag published in Weekly Sh nen Jumpin 2015 failed to become a serialized work Tatsuhiko Katayama Goto u ge's first editor suggested Goto u ge to start a series with an easy to understand theme 5 Goto u ge's debut work Kaga riga ri would become the basis for an initial draft titled Kisa tsu no Nag are since it had concepts like swords and demons which would be familiar to the Japanese audience 5 However due to its serious tone lack of comic relief and dark story this draft was not accepted for serialization so Katayama asked Goto u ge to try writing a brighter more average character in the same setting 5 The original title was Kisa tsu no Yai ba but they felt the character s a tsu lit kill in the title was too overt Although it is a made up word kim e tsu seemed easy to understand so Goto u ge thought it would be interesting to abbreviate the series ' title that way the word yai ba lit blade implies a Japanese sword 5 According to Goto u ge
