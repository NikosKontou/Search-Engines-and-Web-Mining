'Blade of Demon Destruction' [ 4 ] ) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Koyoharu Gotouge . It was serialized in Shueisha 's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from February 2016 to May 2020, with its chapters collected in 23 tankōbon volumes. It has been published in English by Viz Media and simultaneously on the Manga Plus platform by Shueisha. It follows teenage Tanjiro Kamado , who joins the Demon Slayer Corps after his family is slaughtered and the sole survivor, his younger sister Nezuko , is turned into a demon , in the hopes of turning her human again.\n\nAn anime television series adaptation , produced by Ufotable , aired a 26-episode first season from April to September 2019, with a sequel film, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train , released in October 2020, which became the highest-grossing anime and Japanese film of all time.

An eight-episode fourth season aired from May to June 2024. A film trilogy sequel adapting the \"Infinity Castle\" story arc premiered in theaters in July 2025.\n\nBy July 2025, the manga had over 220 million copies in circulation, including digital versions , making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time; it was the best-selling manga of 2019 and 2020. It has received critical acclaim for its art, storyline, action scenes and characters. The Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba franchise is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.\n\nIn Taishō era Japan, a secret organization known as the \"Demon Slayer Corps\" has waged a war against demons for centuries. Demons are former humans who possess supernatural abilities such as enhanced strength, rapid regeneration, and unique powers referred to as \"Blood Demon Arts\". Demons can only be killed if they are exposed to direct sunlight, decapitated with weapons crafted from an alloy called Nichirin, or injected with a poison extracted from wisteria flowers.\n\nIn contrast, the Demon Slayers are entirely human but employ specialized elemental breathing techniques known as \"Breathing Styles\". These techniques grant them superhuman strength, heightened abilities, and increased resilience that enable them to fight demons effectively. The most formidable Demon Slayers are known as the \"Hashira\" and gain this title through multiple advancements in the Corps' ranks, culminating in killing fifty demons at the highest level or a member of the Twelve Kizuki.\n\nTanjiro Kamado is a kind-hearted and diligent boy who lives with his family in the mountains. After the death of his father, he becomes the sole provider for his household, selling charcoal in nearby villages. He returns home one day to discover his family has been slaughtered by a demon. His younger sister, Nezuko , is the only survivor, though she has been transformed into a demon herself. She exhibits the unusual trait of retaining some human emotion and cognition. The pair are discovered by Giyu Tomioka , the Water Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, who sends Tanjiro to be trained by his own former mentor, Sakonji Urokodaki . Tanjiro vows to become a Demon Slayer to avenge his family and find a way to return Nezuko to humanity.\n\nAfter mastering the \"Water Breathing\" swordsmanship style, Tanjiro passes the Corps' final selection. Nezuko, who has been placed under a hypnotic suggestion by Urokodaki to suppress her demonic urges, accompanies him. During a mission in Asakusa , they encounter Muzan Kibutsuji , the progenitor of all demons and the one responsible for the murder of their family. They also befriend Tamayo and her assistant Yushiro , two demons who have freed themselves from Muzan's control. Tamayo agrees to develop a cure for Nezuko, a process that requires blood from the powerful Twelve Kizuki, Muzan's most elite subordinates.\n\nTanjiro and Nezuko are joined in their mission by fellow Demon Slayers Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira . Together, they defeat several members of the Twelve Kizuki. During a fierce battle, Tanjiro awakens a mysterious and powerful swordsmanship technique known as \"Hinokami Kagura\". Their actions draw the attention of the Hashira, the Corps' highest-ranking swordsmen, and they are brought before the organization's leader, Kagaya Ubuyashiki . He sanctions their continued partnership, believing the siblings are pivotal to defeating Muzan.\n\nMuzan, enraged by the failures of his Lower Ranks, executes them and orders the sole survivor to kill Tanjiro. After a battle aboard a moving train, Tanjiro prevails with the aid of the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku , who is subsequently killed by the Upper Three demon, Akaza . The group continues their campaign, assisting the Sound Hashira in defeating Upper Six and later helping the Mist and Love Hashira eliminate Upper Five and Upper Four at the Swordsmith Village. During these events, Nezuko develops an immunity to sunlight, making her the key to Muzan's goal of overcoming his own fatal weakness. Tanjiro also learns his Hinokami Kagura is derived from \"Sun Breathing\", the original swordsmanship style created by Yoriichi Tsugikuni .\n\nThe Demon Slayer Corps prepares for a final confrontation as Tamayo works on a serum. Muzan launches a preemptive assault, prompting Kagaya to sacrifice himself in a suicide attack. The Hashira engage Muzan, but he traps them within the Infinity Castle, where they must battle the remaining Upper Ranks. Through great sacrifice, the demons Akaza, Doma, and Kokushibo are defeated. Muzan kills Tamayo but is severely weakened by the poison she implanted in him. Forced above ground, a desperate battle ensues as the remaining Demon Slayers fight to hold him until sunrise. Though most of the Hashira perish, Tanjiro delivers the final blow. With his last breath, Muzan transforms Tanjiro into a demon, but Nezuko, now fully human, helps reverse the transformation.\n\nIn the aftermath of Muzan's defeat, all demons under his control perish. The Demon Slayer Corps is disbanded, with only two Hashira surviving. Tanjiro and Nezuko return to their mountain home, their journey finally complete. In the ensuing years, Tanjiro marries Kanao Tsuyuri, Inosuke weds Aoi Kanzaki, and Zenitsu marries Nezuko. In a modern-day epilogue, their descendants and reincarnations live in a world free from demons.\n\nAfter Gotouge's previous manga, Haeniwa no Zigzag , published in Weekly Shōnen Jump in 2015, failed to become a serialized work, Tatsuhiko Katayama, Gotouge's first editor, suggested Gotouge to start a series with an \"easy-to-understand theme\". [ 5 ] Gotouge's debut work Kagarigari would become the basis for an initial draft, titled Kisatsu no Nagare ( 鬼殺の流れ ) since it had concepts like swords and demons, which would be familiar to the Japanese audience. [ 5 ] However, due to its serious tone, lack of comic relief, and dark story, this draft was not accepted for serialization, so Katayama asked Gotouge to try writing a brighter, more average character in the same setting. [ 5 ] The original title was Kisatsu no Yaiba ( 鬼殺の刃 ) , but they felt the character \"satsu\" ( 殺 ; lit. \"kill\") in the title was too overt. Although it is a made-up word, \"kimetsu\" ( 鬼滅 ) seemed easy to understand, so Gotouge thought it would be interesting to abbreviate the series' title that way; the word \"yaiba\" ( 刃 ; lit. \"blade\") implies a Japanese sword . [ 5 ] According to Gotouge, the series' three biggest influences are JoJo's Bizarre Adventure , Naruto and Bleach . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Tatsuhiko Katayama, an editor of the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba manga, stated that Tanjiro was partially influenced by Himura Kenshin , the protagonist of Rurouni Kenshin . [ 5 ] [ 8 ]\n\nWritten and illustrated by Koyoharu Gotouge , Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba was serialized in Shueisha 's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from February 15, 2016, to May 18, 2020.

[ 114 ] [ 115 ]\n\nRegarding the series' sudden huge success, Weekly Shōnen Jump editor-in-chief Hiroyuki Nakano stated that the manga sales shot up straight after its anime adaptation finished, explaining that a large number of people watched the series through streaming services after it ended rather than watching it weekly. Nakano also stated that it is harder for a manga series running in the magazine to become a hit, and Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba , despite having started in February 2016, did not become a major hit until late 2019, adding that its success \"hinged on word of mouth generated after the anime's run\". [ 116 ] Nakan also said that it introduced many new people and audiences to Jump . [ 117 ] On December 20, 2020, at the Jump Festa '21 , Mayumi Tanaka , voice actress of One Piece ' s Monkey D. Luffy , read aloud a message from One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda , in which he praised Gotouge's series, and wrote: \"At Jump , Demon Slayer was really amazing.

Silverman praised the plot ideas and characters but had issues with its pacing. She labeled Gotouge's art as \"unpolished and inconsistent,\" although she commended details such as those in Tanjiro and Nezuko's clothing which illustrate both the poverty and loving environment from which they come. Silverman concluded by saying that it was the work of a promising author and had positive expectations for the series' development. [ 175 ]\n\nLeroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin gave the first volume a score of 9/10. He commended the series for its \"ability to convey power in simplicity,\" explaining that Gotouge's art is \"nice\" but overly detailed, and the dialogue and exposition are straightforward. Douresseaux praised its characters and recommended the series to fans of demon-fighting heroes. [ 176 ] Nick Smith of ICv2 gave the first volume a score of 4/5. He wrote that the story is well crafted and the characters intriguing, but the setting is \"too deadly for the survival of the human race.\" Smith said that the artwork is good but not special and recommended the series to \"teens and adults who like heroes fighting back against horrific evil.\" [ 177 ] Che Gilson of Otaku USA praised the series for its plot, action and character development. Gilson said that the art was \"stiff\", but that instead of looking like rough drawings or traced photo composites, the series \"looks as if it were carved and printed from woodblocks.\" Gilson concluded: \"With an engrossing plot and characters, Volume 1 builds to a cliffhanger that makes it hard to wait for the next volume.\" [ 178 ] Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post criticized the first chapter for being \"overly wordy when just the action would suffice,\" and ultimately called it \"a work-in-progress series.\" [ 179 ] After having watched the anime adaptation, Melina Dargis of the same website was so fascinated by the story and characters that she decided to go back and review the second volume of the manga. Despite knowing what would happen, Dargis wrote that it was \"still such a delight to relive it again\" and concluded; \"It's a really great story and appeals to a wide variety of interests.\" [ 180 ]\n\nManga artists have lauded the series; Yoshihiro Togashi wrote a praising comment featured on the obi of series fourth volume; [ 181 ] [ 182 ] Osamu Akimoto wrote a praising comment featured on the obi of the series' fifth volume; [ 183 ] and Takayuki Yamaguchi praised the series and recommended it in a 2018 interview, around the time of its tenth volume.
