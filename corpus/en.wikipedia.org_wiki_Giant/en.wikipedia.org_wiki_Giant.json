    "transformers_text": "In folklore giants from Ancient Greek gigas cognate giga are beings of humanoid appearance but are at times prodigious in size and strength or bear an otherwise notable appearance The word giant is first attested in 1297 from Robert of Gloucester's chronicle 1 It is derived from the Gigantes Ancient Greek 2 of Greek mythology Fairy tales such as Jack the Giant Killer have formed the modern perception of giants as dimwitted and violent ogres sometimes said to eat humans while other giants tend to eat livestock In more recent portrayals like those of Jonathan Swift and Roald Dahl some giants are both intelligent and friendly Giants appear many times in folklore and myths Representing the human body enlarged to the point of being monstrous giants evoke terror and remind humans of their body's frailty and mortality They are often portrayed as monsters and antagonists but there are exceptions Some giants intermingle with humans in a friendly way and can even be part of human families their offspring portrayed as regular humans often referred to as half giants 3 Folklorist s and historians examine the role giants are assigned in regional geo mythologies For example Fionn mac Cum hail lis said to have built the Giant's Causeway on the island of Ireland 4 Per a 1965 examination in an American studies journal It is generally admitted today that Paul Bunyan was a synthetic figure conceived by advertising men rather than the spontaneous product of the folk mind yet he has been adopted by the American people with enthusiasm Paul and his blue ox Babe are supposed to have altered the appearance of the American continent the animal's hoof prints became the lake beds of the Northwest and from its drinking trough spilled the Mississippi River 5 Fossilized

heroes horses and war elephants are said to have died 6 Claudine Cohen in her 2002 book The Fate of the Mammoth argued that the history of human interaction with fossil bones of prehistoric megafauna was heavily influenced by giant lore 7 Per Cohen the proto scientific study of giants appears in several phases of human history Herodotus reported that the remains of Orestes were found in Te gea Pliny described a giant's skeleton found in Crete after an earthquake and seemed to refer to evolution as the process by which giants become human size over time and Saint Augustine mentions what is believed to have been the fossilized molar of an ancient Elephantidae in his City of God in a passage reflecting on the nature and meaning of the No a haci an deluge 7 The academic consideration of

intellectuals Cotton Mather and Edward Taylor 9 Genesis tells of the Ne phil im before and after Noah's Flood The word Ne phil im is loosely translated as giants in some translations of the Hebrew Bible but left untranslated in others According to Genesis 7 23 the Ne phil im were destroyed in the Flood but Ne phil im are reported after the Flood including The Book of Numbers 10 includes the discouraging report by the spies sent by Moses into Canaan We can't attack those people they are stronger than we are All the people we saw there are of great size We saw the Ne phil im there the descendants of Anak come from the Ne phil im We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes and we looked the same to them The Book of Joshua describing the actual conquest of Canaan in a later generation makes reference to such people living there in Joshua 14 12 15 and Joshua 15 13 14 The Bible also tells of Gog and Magog who later entered European folklore and of the famous battle between David and the Philistine Goliath While Goliath is often portrayed as a giant in retelling s of the Biblical narrative he appears to be significantly smaller than other giants biblical or otherwise The Masoretic Text version of the Book of Samuel gives his height as six cubits and one span possibly 313 372 centimetres 10 ft 3 in 12 ft 2 in 15 while the Septuagint the 1 st century Jewish historian
