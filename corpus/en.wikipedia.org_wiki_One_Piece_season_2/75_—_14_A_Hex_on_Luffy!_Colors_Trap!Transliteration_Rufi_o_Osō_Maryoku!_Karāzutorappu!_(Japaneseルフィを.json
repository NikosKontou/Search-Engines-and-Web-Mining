Usopp and Karoo face Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine, but instead of fighting, they let themselves be chased through the jungle. Luffy tries to destroy the wax pedestal threatening the lives of his friends, while Mr. 3 fights to keep it intact. Once Luffy sent the officer agent flying into the jungle, the captives find Luffy unwilling to help them, because Mr. 3's partner, Miss Golden Week has him firmly under control with her emotion inducing paintings. Unable to catch Karoo and Usopp, Mr. 5 resolves to use his newest piece of equipment, a revolver, which he loads, instead of with bullets, with his explosive breath.",
