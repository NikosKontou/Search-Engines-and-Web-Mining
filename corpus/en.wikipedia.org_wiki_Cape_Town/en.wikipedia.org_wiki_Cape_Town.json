largest city by population after Johannesburg and the largest city in the Western Cape 15 The city is part of the City of Cape Town metropolitan municipality The city is known for its harbour its natural setting in the Cape Floristic Region and for landmarks such as Table Mountain and Cape Point Cape Town has been named the best city in the world and world's best city for travelers numerous times including by The New York Times in 2014 16 Time Out in 2025 17 and The Telegraph for the past 8 years 2017 through 2025 18 Located on the shore of Table Bay the City Bowl area of Cape Town which contains its central business district CBD is the oldest urban area in the Western Cape with a significant cultural heritage The metropolitan area has a long coastline on the Atlantic Ocean which includes a northern section in the West Beach region as well as the False Bay area in the south The Table Mountain National Park is within the city boundaries and there are several other nature reserves and marine protected areas within and adjacent to the city These include Kirsten bosch National Botanical Garden which contains 5 of South Africa's 6 biomes and displays many plants native to the Cape region Cape Town has South Africa's highest household in comes 19 lowest rate of unemployment 20 highest level of infrastructure investment 21 strongest service delivery performance 22 largest tourism appeal 18 and most robust real estate market 23 The earliest known remnants of human occupation in the region were found at Peers Cave in Fish Hoe k and have been dated to between 15 000 and 12 000 years old 24 better source needed Bartolomeu Dias the first European to reach the area arrived in 1488 and named it Cape of Storms Cabo das Torment as It was later renamed by John II of Portugal as Cape of Good Hope Cabo da Boa Es per an a because of the great optimism engendered by the opening of a sea route to the Indian subcontinent and East Indies In 1497 Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama recorded a sighting of the Cape of Good Hope In 1510 at the Battle of Salt River the Portuguese admiral Francisco de Almeida and sixty four of his men were killed and his party was defeated 25 by the Goring hai qua in Dutch approximate spelling using cattle that were specially trained to respond to whistles and shouts 26 The Gori nai qua were one of the Khoi khoi clans who inhabited the area In the late 16 th century French Danish Dutch and English but mainly Portuguese ships regularly continued to stop over in Table Bay en route to the Indies They traded tobacco copper and iron with the Khoi khoi clans of the region in exchange for fresh meat and other essential traveling provisions In 1652 Jan van Riebeeck and other employees of the United East India Company Dutch Vere nig de Oost indische Compagnie VOC were sent to the Cape Colony to establish a way station for ships travelling to the Dutch East Indies and the Fort de Goede Hoop later replaced by the Castle of Good Hope The settlement grew slowly during this period as it was hard to find adequate labour This labour shortage prompted the local authorities to import enslaved people from Indonesia and Madagascar Many of these people are ancestors of modern day Cape Coloured and Cape Malay communities 27 28 Under Van Riebeeck and his successors as VOC commanders and later governors at the Cape a wide range of agricultural plants were introduced to the Cape Some of these including grapes cereals ground nuts potatoes apples and citrus had a large and lasting influence on the societies and economies of the region 29 With the Dutch Republic being transformed into Revolutionary France's vassal Batavian Republic Great Britain moved to take control of Dutch colonies including the colonial possessions of the VOC Britain captured Cape Town in 1795 but it was returned to the Dutch by treaty in 1803 British forces occupied the Cape again in 1806 following the Battle of Bla a uw berg when the Batavian Republic allied with Britain's rival France during the Napoleonic Wars Following the conclusion of the war Cape Town was permanently ceded to the United Kingdom in the Anglo Dutch Treaty of 1814 The city became the capital of the newly formed Cape Colony whose territory expanded very substantially through the 1800 s partially as a result of numerous wars with the ama Xhosa on the colony's eastern frontier In 1833 slavery was abolished in the colony freeing over 5500 slaves in the city almost a third of the city's population at the time 30 The Convict Crisis of 1849 marked by substantial civil upheaval bolstered the push for self governance in the Cape 31 32 With expansion came calls for greater independence from the UK with the Cape attaining its own parliament 1854 and a locally accountable Prime Minister 1872 Suffrage was established according to the non racial Cape Qualified Franchise 33 34 During the 1850 s and 1860 s additional plant species were introduced from Australia by the British authorities Notably roo ik ran s was introduced to stabilise the s and of the Cape Flats to allow for a road connecting the peninsula with the rest of the African continent 35 and eucalyptus was used to drain marshes 36 In 1859 the first railway line was built by the Cape Government Railways and a system of railways rapidly expanded in the 1870 s The discovery of diamonds in Gri qua land West in 1867 and the Witwatersrand Gold Rush in 1886 prompted a flood of immigration into South Africa 37 In 1895 the city's first public power station the Graaff Electric Lighting Works was opened Conflicts between the Boer republics in the interior and the British colonial government resulted in the Second Boer War of 1899 1902 Britain's victory in this war led to the formation of a united South Africa From 1891 to 1901 the city's population more than doubled from 67 000 to 171 000 38 As the 19 th century came to an end the economic and political dominance of Cape Town in the Southern Africa region during the 19 th century started to give way to the dominance of Johannesburg and Pretoria in the 20 th century 39 In 1910 Britain established the Union of South Africa which unified the Cape Colony with the two defeated Boer Republics and the British colony of Natal Cape Town became the legislative capital of the Union and later of the Republic of South Africa By the time of the 1936 census Johannesburg had overtaken Cape Town as the largest city in the country In 1945 the expansion of the Cape Town foreshore was completed adding an additional 194 ha 480 acres to the Cape Town CBD and by extension the City Bowl region 40 Prior to the mid twentieth century Cape Town was one of the most racially integrated cities in South Africa 41 42 In the 1948 national elections the National Party won on a platform of apartheid racial segregation under the slogan of s wart gev aar Afrikaans for black danger This led to the erosion and eventual abolition of the Cape's multiracial franchise In 1950 the apartheid government first introduced the Group Areas Act which classified and segregated urban areas according to race Formerly multi racial suburbs of Cape Town were either purged of residents deemed unlawful by apartheid legislation or demolished The most in famous example of this in Cape Town was the suburb of District Six After it was declared a whites only area in 1965 all housing there was demolished and over 60 000 residents were forcibly removed 43 Many of these residents were relocated to the Cape Flats The earliest of the Cape Flats forced removals saw the expulsion of Black South Africans to Lang a Cape Town's first and oldest township in line with the 1923 Native Urban Areas Act Under apartheid the Cape was considered a Coloured labour preference area to the exclusion of Bantu s i e Black Africans The implementation of this policy was widely opposed by trade unions civil society and opposition parties It is notable that this policy was not advocated for by any Coloured political group and its implementation was a unilateral decision by the apartheid government 44 During the student led Soweto Uprising of June 1976 school students from Lang a Gugu let hu and N yanga in Cape Town reacted to the news of the protests against Bantu Education by organising gatherings and marches of their own A number of school buildings were burnt down and the protest action was met with forceful resistance from the police 45 46 Cape Town has been home to many leaders of the anti apartheid movement In Table Bay 10 km 6 mi from the city is Robben Island This penitentiary island was the site of a maximum security prison where many famous apart heir d era political prisoners served long prison sentences Famous prisoners include activist lawyer and future president Nelson Mandela who served 18 of his 27 years of imprisonment on the island as well as two other future presidents Kg alem a Mot lan the and Jacob Zuma 47 In one of the most famous moments marking the end of apartheid Nelson Mandela made his first public speech since his imprisonment from the balcony of Cape Town City Hall hours after being released on 11 February 1990 His speech heralded the beginning of a new era for the country The first democratic election was held four years later on 27 April 1994 48 49 50 Nobel Square in the Victoria Alfred Waterfront features statues of South Africa's four Nobel Peace Prize winners Albert Luth uli Desmond Tutu F W de Klerk and Nelson Mandela relevant discuss Cape Town has undergone significant changes in the years since Apartheid Cape Town has experienced economic growth and development in the post apartheid era The city has become a major economic hub in South Africa attracting international investment and tourism The Democratic Alliance DA a liberal political party which came to power in Cape Town in 2006 has been credited with improving bureaucratic efficiency public safety and fostering economic development 51 52 Opinion polls show that South Africans view the Western Cape as the best governed province Cape Town as the best governed city in the country 53 54 Of South Africa's 257 municipalities only 38 received a clean financial audit in 2022 from the Auditor General Of those 21 were in the Western Cape 51 The city's economy has diversified with growth in sectors such as technology finance real estate and tourism The establishment of the City Centre Improvement District C CID has been particularly successful in revitalizing the city center bringing businesses and people back into the area This initiative has transformed public spaces such as Green market Square Company's Garden and St George's Mall attracting both locals and tourists 55 In 2014 Cape Town was named World Design Capital of the Year 56 Cape Town was voted the best tourist destination in Africa at the 2023 World Travel Awards in Dubai and continues to be the most important tourist destination in the country 57 58 Cape Town has been named the best travel city in the world every year since 2013 in the Telegraph Travel Awards 59 60 The legacy of apartheid's spatial planning is still evident with significant disparities between affluent areas and impoverished townships 61 60 of the city's population live in townships and informal settlements far from the city centre 62 The legacy of Apartheid means Cape Town remains one of the most racially segregated cities in South Africa 63 Many Black South Africans continue to live in informal settlements with limited access to basic services such as healthcare education and sanitation 61 64 The unemployment rate remains high at 23 though nearly 10 points lower than the nationwide average particularly among historically disadvantaged groups and economic opportunities are unevenly distributed 52 Cape Town faced a severe water shortage from 2015 to 2018 65 According to Oxfam in the face of an imminent water shortage the city of Cape Town in South Africa successfully reduced its water use by more than half in three years cutting it from 1 2 bn litres per day in February 2015 to 516 m litres per day in 2018 66 In 2021 Cape Town also experienced a violent turf war between rival mini bus taxi firms which led to the deaths of 83 people Two years later a strike by the mini bus taxi firms resulted in 5 deaths Since the 2010 s Cape Town and the wider Western Cape province have seen the rise of a small secessionist movement 67 Support for parties which have formally adopted Cape independence was around 5 in the 2021 municipal elections 68 Cape Town is located at latitude 33 55 S approximately the same as Sydney and Buenos Aires and equivalent to Casablanca and Los Angeles in the northern hemisphere and longitude 18 25 E Table Mountain with its near vertical cliffs and flat topped summit over 1 000 m 3 300 ft high and with Devil's Peak and Lion's Head on either side together form a dramatic mountainous backdrop which creates the City Bowl This area comprises the Cape Town CBD as well as numerous suburbs on the mountainside A thin strip of cloud known colloquially as the tablecloth Karo s in Afrikaans sometimes forms on top of the mountain To the immediate south of the city the Cape Peninsula is a scenic mountainous spine jutting 40 km 25 mi southward into the Atlantic Ocean and terminating at Cape Point There are over 70 peaks above 300 m 980 ft within Cape Town's official metropolitan limits Many of the city's suburbs lie on the large plain called the Cape Flats which extends over 50 km 30 mi to the east and joins the peninsula to the mainland The Cape Town region is characterised by an extensive coastline rugged mountain ranges coastal plains and inland valleys The extent of Cape Town has varied considerably over time It originated as a small settlement at the foot of Table Mountain and has grown beyond its city limits as a metropolitan area to encompass the entire Cape Peninsula to the south the Cape Flats the Helder berg basin and part of the Steen bras catchment area to the east and the Ty gerber g hills B lou berg and other areas to the north Robben Island in Table Bay is also part of Cape Town It is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and False Bay to the south To the north and east the extent is demarcated by boundaries of neighbouring municipalities within the Western Cape province The official boundaries of the city proper extend between the City Bowland the Atlantic Seaboard to the east and the Southern Suburbs to the south The City of Cape Town the metropolitan municipality that takes its name from the city covers the Greater Cape Town metropolitan area known as the Cape Metro pole extending beyond the city proper itself to include a number of satellite towns suburbs and rural areas such as Atlantis Bell ville B lou berg Bracken fell Durban ville Goodwood Gordon's Bay H out Bay Kha yel it sha Kr a a if on te in Ku il sri

Point in the north to Cape Point in the south 71 with an area of about 470 km 2 180 sq mi and it displays more topographical variety than other similar sized areas in southern Africa and consequently spectacular scenery There are diverse low nutrient soils large rocky outcrops s cree slopes a mainly rocky coastline with em bayed beaches and considerable local variation in climatic conditions 72 The sedimentary rocks of the Cape Supergroup of which parts of the G raaf water and Peninsula Formations remain were uplifted between 280 and 21 S million years ago and were largely eroded away during the Mesozoic The region was geologically stable during the Tertiary which has led to slow den ud ation of the durable sandstones Erosion rate and drainage has been influenced by fault lines and fractures leaving remnant steep sided massif s like Table Mountain surrounded by flatter slopes of deposits of the eroded material overlaying the older rocks 72 There are two internationally notable landmarks Table Mountain and Cape Point at opposite ends of the Peninsula Mountain Chain with the Cape Flats and False Bay to the east and the Atlantic Ocean to the west The landscape is dominated by sandstone plateaux and ridges which generally drop steeply at their margins to the surrounding debris slopes interrupted by a major gap at the Fish Hoe k Noord hoe k valley In the south much of the area is a low sandstone plateau with s and dunes Maximum altitude is 1113 m on Table Mountain 72 The Cape Flats Afrikaans Ka apse V lak te is a flat low lying sandy area area to the east the Cape Peninsula and west of the Helder berg much of which was wetland and dunes within recent history To the north are the Ty gerber g Hills and the Stellenbosch district The Helder berg area of Greater Cape Town previously known as the Hot ten tots Holland area is mostly residential but also a wine producing area east of the Cape Flats west of the Hot ten tots Holland mountain range and south of the Helder berg mountain from which it gets its current name The Helder berg consists of the previous municipalities of Somerset West Strand Gordon s Bay and a few other towns Industry and commerce is largely in service of the area After the Cape Peninsula Helder berg is the next most mountainous part of Greater Cape Town bordered to the north and east by the highest peaks in the region along the watershed of the Helder berg and Hot ten tots Holland Mountains which are part of the Cape Fold Belt with Cape Supergroup strata on a basement of Ty gerber g Formation rocks intruded by part of the Stellenbosch granite pluto n The region includes the entire catchment of the Louren s and Sir Lowry's rivers separated by the Sch ape nberg hill and a small part of the catchment of the Eerste River to the west The Helder berg is ecologically highly diverse rivaling the Cape Peninsula and has its own endemic ecoregions and several conservation areas To the east of the Hot ten tots Holland mountains is the valley of the Steen bras River in which the Steen bras Dam was built as a water supply for Cape Town The dam has been supplemented by several other dams around the western Cape some of them considerably larger This is almost entirely a conservation area of high biodiversity Bell ville Bracken fell Durban ville Kr a a if on te in Goodwood and Paro ware a few of the towns that make up the Northern Suburbs of Cape Town In current popular culture these areas are often referred to as being beyond the boere wor s curtain a play on the term iron curtain UNESCO declared Robben Island in the Western Cape a World Heritage Site in 1999 Robben Island is located in Table Bay some 6 km 3 7 mi west of B lou bergstra nd a coastal suburb north of Cape Town and stands some 30 m above sea level Robben Island has been used as a prison where people were isolated banished and exiled for nearly 400 years It was also used as a leper colony a post office a grazing ground a mental hospital and an outpost 73 The coastline of Cape Town is roughly 307 km long from Sil we rst room strand at 33 34 14 994 S 18 20 34 959 E 33 57083167 S 18 34304417 E 33 57083167 18 34304417 on the west coast

peninsula that juts out into the Atlantic Ocean at the south western extremity of the continent At its tip is Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope The peninsula forms the west side of False Bay and the Cape Flats On the east side are the Helder berg and Hot ten tots Holland mountains The three main rock formations are the late Precambrian Malmesbury group sedimentary and metamorphic rock the Cape Granite suit comprising the huge Peninsula Ku il sri vier Helder berg and Stellenbosch batholith s that were intruded into the Malmesbury Group about 630 million years ago and the Table Mountain group sandstones that were deposited on the eroded surface of the granite and Malmesbury series basement about 450 million years ago The s and silt and mud deposits were li th if i ed by pressure and then folded during the Cape Orogeny to form the Cape Fold Belt which extends in an arc along the western and southern coasts The present landscape is due to prolonged erosion having carved out deep valleys removing parts of the once continuous Table Mountain Group sandstone cover from over the Cape Flats and False Bay and leaving high residual mountain ridges 75 At times the sea covered the Cape Flats and Noord hoe k valley and the Cape Peninsula was then a group of islands During glacial periods the sea level dropped to expose the bottom of False Bay to weathering and erosion with the last major regression leaving the entire bottom of False Bay exposed During this period an extensive system of dunes was formed on the sandy floor of False Bay At this time the drainage outlets lay between Rocky Bank Cape Point to the west and between Rocky Bank and Hang k lip Ridge to the east with the watershed roughly along the line of the contact zone east of Seal Island and Whittle Rock 75 76 Ch 2 Cape Town has a Mediterranean climate K ppen Csb bordering Csa 77 78 79 with mild moderately wet winters and dry warm summers Winter which lasts from June to September may see large cold fronts entering for limited periods from the Atlantic Ocean with significant precipitation and strong north westerly winds Winter months in the city average a maximum of 18 C 64 F and minimum of 8 5 C 47 F Winters are snow and frost free except on Table Mountain and on other mountain peaks where light accumulation of snow and frost can sometimes occur 80 Total annual rainfall in the city averages 515 mm 20 3 in although in the Southern Suburbs close to the mountains rainfall is significantly higher and averages closer to 1 000 mm 39 4 in Summer which lasts from December to March is warm and dry with an average maximum of 26 C 79 F and minimum of 16 C 61 F The region can get uncomfortably hot when the Berg Wind meaning mountain wind blows from the Karoo interior Spring and summer generally feature a strong wind from the south east known locally as the south easter or the Cape Doctor so called because it blows air pollution away This wind is caused by a persistent high pressure system over the South Atlantic to the west of Cape Town known as the South Atlantic High which shifts latitude seasonally following the sun and influencing the strength of the fronts and their northward reach Cape Town receives about 3 100 hours of sunshine per year 81 Water temperatures range greatly between 10 C 50 F on the Atlantic Seaboard to over 22 C 72 F in False Bay Average annual ocean surface temperatures are between 13 C 55 F on the Atlantic Seaboard similar to Californian waters such as San Francisco or Big Sur and 17 C 63 F in False Bay similar to Northern Mediterranean temperatures such as Nice or Monte Carlo Unlike other parts of the country the city does not have many thunderstorms and most of those that do occur happen around October to December and March to April A 2019 paper published in PLO S One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4 5 a moderate scenario of climate change where global warming reaches 2 5 3 C 4 5 5 4 F by 2100 the climate of Cape Town in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Perth in Australia The annual temperature would increase by 1 1 C 2 0 F and the temperature of the coldest month by 0 3 C 0 54 F while the temperature of the warmest month would be 2 3 C 4 1 F higher 85 86 According to Climate Action Tracker the current warming trajectory appears consistent with 2 7 C 4 9 F which closely matches RCP 4 5 87 Moreover according to the 2022 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report Cape Town is one of 12 major African cities Abidjan Alexandria Algiers Cape Town Casablanca Dakar Dar es Salaam Durban Lagos Lom Luanda and Maputo which would be the most severely affected by future sea level rise It estimates that they would collectively sustain cumulative damages of US 65 billion under RCP 4 5 and US 86 5 billion for the high emission scenario RCP 8 5 by the year 2050 Additionally RCP 8 5 combined with the hypothetical impact from marine ice sheet instability at high levels of warming would involve up to US 137 5 billion in damages clarification needed while the additional accounting for the low probability high damage events may increase aggregate risks to US 187 billion for the moderate RCP 4 5 US 206 billion for RCP 8 5 and US 397 billion under the high end ice sheet instability scenario 88 Since sea level rise would continue for about 10 000 years under every scenario of climate change future costs of sea level rise would only increase especially without adaptation measures clarification needed 89 Cape Town's coastal water ranges from cold to mild and the difference between the two sides of the peninsula can be dramatic While the Atlantic Seaboard averages annual sea surface temperatures average between 10 and 15 C 50 and 59 F the False Bay coast is much warmer averaging between 16 and 22 C 61 and 72 F annually 91 In summer False Bay water averages slightly over 20 C 68 F with 22 C 72 F an occasional high Beaches located on the Atlantic Coast tend to have colder water due to the wind driven upwelling s which contribute to the Ben gue la Current which originates off the Cape Peninsula while the water at False Bay beaches may occasionally be warmer by up to 10 C 18 F at the same time in summer 91 In summer False Bay is thermally stratified with a vertical temperature variation of 5 to 9 C between the warmer surface water and cooler depths below 50 m while in winter the water column is at nearly constant temperature at all depths The development of a thermocline is strongest around late December and peaks in late summer to early autumn 92 8 In summer the south easterly winds generate a zone of upwelling near Cape Hang k lip where surface water temperatures can be 6 to 7 C colder than the surrounding areas and bottom temperatures below 12 C 92 10 In the summer to early autumn January March cold water upwelling near Cape Hang k lip causes a strong surface temperature gradient between the south western and north eastern corners of the bay In winter the surface temperature tends to be much the same everywhere In the northern sector surface temperature varies a bit more 13 to 22 C than in the south 14 to 20 C during the year 90 Surface temperature variation from year to year is linked to the El Ni o Southern Oscillation During El Ni o years the South Atlantic high is shifted reducing the south easterly winds so upwelling and evaporative cooling are reduced and sea surface temperatures throughout the bay are warmer while in La Ni a years there is more wind and upwelling and consequently lower temperatures Surface water heating during El Ni o increases vertical stratification The relationship is not linear 90 Occasionally eddies from the Agulhas current will bring warmer water and vagrant sea life carried from the south and east coasts into False Bay Located in a Conservation International biodiversity hotspot as well as the unique Cape Floristic Region the city of Cape Town has one of the highest levels of biodiversity of any equivalent area in the world 93 94 These protected areas are a World Heritage Site and an estimated 2 200 species of plants are confined to Table Mountain more than exist in the whole of the United Kingdom which has 1200 plant species and 67 endemic plant species 95 96 97 Many of these species including a great many types of protea s are endemic to the mountain and can be found nowhere else 98 It is home to a total of 19 different vegetation types of which several are endemic to the city and occur nowhere else in the world 99 It is also the only habitat of hundreds of endemic species 100 and hundreds of others which are severely restricted or threatened This enormous species diversity is mainly because the city is uniquely located at the convergence point of several different soil types and micro climates 101 102 Table Mountain has an unusually rich biodiversity Its vegetation consists predominantly of several different types of the unique and rich Cape Fy n bos The main vegetation type is endangered Peninsula Sandstone Fy n bos but critically endangered Peninsula Granite Fy n bos Peninsula Shale Re noster veld and Afromontane forest occur in smaller portions on the mountain Rapid population growth and urban sprawl has covered much of these ecosystems with development Consequently Cape Town now has over 300 threatened plant species and 13 which are now extinct The Cape Peninsula which lies entirely within the city of Cape Town has the highest concentration of threatened species of any continental area of equivalent size in the world 103 Tiny remnant populations of critically endangered or near extinct plants sometimes survive on road sides pavements and sports fields 104 The remaining ecosystems are partially protected through a system of over 30 nature reserves including the massive Table Mountain National Park 105 Cape Town reached first place in the 2019 i Naturalist City Nature Challenge in two out of the three categories Most Observations and Most Species This was the first entry by Cape tonian s in this annual competition to observe and record the local biodiversity over a four day long weekend during what is considered the worst time of the year for local observations 106 A worldwide survey suggested that the extinction rate of endemic plants from the City of Cape Town is one of the highest in the world at roughly three per year since 1900 partly a consequence of the very small and localised habitats and high end emi city 107 In 2025 City of Cape Town enacted the Cape Town Biodiversity Spatial Plan C TBS P 2025 a biodiversity policy aimed at guiding development in the city The plan integrates the Cape Town Bio Net 2024 Map which identifies areas to protect to ensure environmental sustainability and categorizes them into Protected Areas Critical Biodiversity Areas Ecological Support Areas and Other Natural Areas The policy will help guide spatial planning environmental assessments and natural resource management across sectors and sets a framework for the internal alignment of environmental responsibilities across all City departments 108 22 72 of Cape Town's municipal land totaling 55 697 hectares is under conservation Of this 20 039 hectares are managed by the City within 22 nature reserves and 16 Biodiversity Agreement Conservation Areas many of which are open to the public 108 The

city is divided into 116 wards each of which elects a councillor by first past the post voting The remaining 115 councillors are elected from party lists so that the total number of councillors for each party is proportional to the number of votes received by that party 109 110 In the 2021 Municipal Elections the Democratic Alliance DA kept its majority this time diminished taking 136 seats The African National Congress lost substantially receiving 43 of the seats 111 112 The Democratic Alliance candidate for the Cape Town mayoralty Geordi n Hill Lewis was elected mayor 113 In recent years Cape Town has developed a reputation for good governance with the city's infrastructure spending and upkeep political stability CBD safety and municipal service delivery being generally regarded as the best out of all the major metropolitan areas in South Africa In 2025 Cape Town was for the third year in a row the only metropolitan municipality in South Africa to receive a clean audit outcome from its Auditor General AG Tsa kani Mal ul eke 114 According to the AG municipalities that achieve clean audits display strong financial and performance management whilst adhering to legislative requirements and Cape Town is a model of governance and accountability The AG further stated that Cape Town showed strong leadership skilled personnel accurate records credible reporting to communities and good quality planning and performance management The city has maintained its clean audit status since 2021 114 Cape Town has nineteen active sister city agreements 115 The City of Cape Town has expressed explicit support for Ukraine during the 2022 invasion of the country by Russia 116 To show this support the City of Cape Town lit up the Old City Hall in the colours of the Ukrainian flagon 2 March 2022 117 118 This has differentiated the city from the officially neutral foreign policy position taken by the South African national government 117 According to the South African National Census of 2011 the population of the City of Cape Town metropolitan municipality an area that includes suburbs and ex urbs is 3 740 026 people This represents an annual growth rate of 2 6 compared to the results of the previous census in 2001 which found a population of 2 892 243 people 128 54 Of those residents who were asked about their first language 35 7 spoke Afrikaans 29 8 spoke Xhosa and 28 4 spoke English 24 8 of the population is under the age of 15 while 5 5 is 65 or older 128 64 The sex ratio is 0 96 meaning that there are slightly more women than men 128 55 Of

Cape Town is the capital and largest city is South Africa's highest by a large margin As of June 2025 the province's average household income is R 407 000 This amount is 35 higher than second place Gauteng and 50 above the national average 19 The total number of households grew from 653 085 in 1996 to 1 068 572 in 2011 which represents an increase of 63 6 128 81 The average number of household

multiple law enforcement agencies working together to ensure the laws of South Africa as well as the provincial and municipal bylaws are upheld throughout the city Different agencies have different jurisdictions granted to them by various levels of government In recent years the City of Cape Town and Western Cape province have been pushing to gain more independence from the South African Police Service and to instead have full control of its policing 262 263 In recent years the city has taken a focused and exceptionally tough approach towards combatting crime with positive impacts The Western Cape's Department of Police Oversight and Community Safety had an annual budget in 2024 of around R 800 million a large portion of which goes to Cape Town Likewise the City of Cape Town's Safety and Security Directorate has a healthy annual budget which totaled around half a billion rand for the 2024 fiscal year 264 265 Cape Town's law enforcement is overseen by the city's May co Member for Safety and Security the Western Cape Community Safety and Police Oversight ME C and the Western Cape Police Commissioner 266 267 The agencies working to ensure safety and security in the City of Cape Town are The Metro Police are responsible for crime prevention as well as the enforcement of municipal bylaws and traffic laws conducting autonomous drug and alcohol related operations executing warrants in support of the South African Police Service and conducting visible policing in specific areas Its special units include In mid 2025 Cape Town rolled out its Neighborhood Safety Officer N SO program Part of the Metro Police N SOs are officers dedicated to patrolling specific neighborhoods across the city On top of other kinds of law enforcement the program positions 5 dedicated N SOs per City of Cape Town municipal ward 269 The Metro Police make use of vehicles including the Toyota Corolla for general law enforcement the Volk wage n Golf GTI for the Flying Squad and the Toyota For tuner for the Highway Patrol The city's Traffic Service has dedicated officers for improving road safety by providing effective driving license services and traffic enforcement The Service employs specially trained peace officers While Metro Police can and do also provide traffic related enforcement the Traffic Service focuses entirely on such Cape Town's Traffic Service enforces traffic laws ensures roadworthy compliance of all motor vehicles and provides driving license services Matters it deals with include drunk driving offenses vehicle impounds animal impounds displaced people graffiti enforcement informal trading liquor enforcement metal theft rail enforcement and neighborhood safety 270 Traffic Services began using dashboard mounted cameras dash cams in 2023 for added security Cape Town's Traffic Services operates a specialized Highway Patrol unit with its own fleet of vehicles that are geared towards maintaining safety on the highways passing through the city 271 LEAP officers are specifically deployed in high crime areas They undergo separate training and exist as an entirely separate police force to Metro Police However they work closely with Metro Police as well as SAPS LEAP officers deal with matters including the confiscation of illegal firearms violence prevention drug and liquor confiscations and anti gang activities 272 The City of Cape Town partnered with the Western Cape Government to launch LEAP in 2020 as part of the latter's Western Cape Safety Plan W CSP which was launched in September 2019 273 SAPS is the national policing authority in South Africa As such they have a presence in Cape Town as with all other major metropolitan areas Their jurisdiction covers the investigation of crimes which may be handed over to them by the Metro Police SAPS employs detectives criminologists forensic pathologists and other related experts as is governed by the Department of Police in the national government 274 SAPS along with Metro Police members are held accountable by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate which investigates wrongdoing within the police service across South Africa In the City of Cape Town SAPS makes use of vehicles including the Toyota Hi lux Toyota For tuner and Nissan Nava ra In early 2025 the City of Cape Town announced its intention to merge numerous police forces info a single law enforcement agency 275 Rate payers in Cape Town fund a number Business Improvement Districts BID across the city with the assistance of the City of Cape Town As of 2025 there were 21 BIDs 277 funded by local rate payers across the city to provide localised supplementary urban management communications and social development services in their respective areas 278 The largest and oldest being the Cape Town Central City Improvement District C CID founded in the year 2000 with a focus on the Cape Town CBD 279 The C CID also employs 12 dedicated Law Enforcement officers to assist with arrests It is able to obtain access to the City of Cape Town's Strategic Surveillance Unit S SU CCTV cameras to assist with crime prevention efforts 276 The presence of BIDs like the C CID has been credited with significantly contributing to the general safety and prosperity of the city 276 280 281 282 Cape Town's Law Enforcement Auxiliary Service LEAS has been operating since 2013 as part of the city's overall public safety program LEAS comprises around 300 individuals who volunteer for a minimum of 16 hours per month LEAS volunteers operate under the supervision of permanent law enforcement officers Uniformed LEAS officers assist with duties including patrolling visible policing enforcing municipal bylaws and directing traffic Non uniformed officers assist with administrative tasks relating to law enforcement 283 LEAS officers undergo thorough vetting are divided up between the 4 geographical areas within the metro and are supported by an Auxiliary Animal Control Unit Marine Unit and Rural Safety Unit 284 The City of Cape Town's Strategic Surveillance Unit S SU uses a system of around 2 000 closed circuit television CCTV cameras 285 throughout the metropolitan area monitoring suburbs for any suspicious activity and using CCTV footage in the prosecution of crimes The CCTV network is used by among other agencies Metro Police LEAP and SAPS including for investigations Control room staff for the CCTV network are able to rapidly deploy response teams ranging from police to emergency services based on the events occurring The cameras are therefore useful not only for crime prevention but also general public safety 286 264 CCTV camera budgeting falls under the allocations of the Safety and Security Directorate which also deploys communications equipment for various Cape Town neighborhood watch organizations The city's CCTV Cameras are also used for license plate recognition by means of Automated Number Plate Recognition ANPR software This is used by units including the city's Highway Patrol In 2019 the City spent around R 20 million on upgrading this system and purchasing new security vehicles 287 264 Since 2024 Cape Town has also made use of its Eye in the Sky Eye Information Surveillance and Reconnaissance initiative an advanced drone based aerial technology system designed to provide real time monitoring of activities on the ground Forming part of a broader push to integrate surveillance technologies into public safety and urban governance Eye's unmanned aerial vehicles U A Vs have been specially designed for fighting crime and are considerably advanced as a result 288 The drones are equipped with infrared cameras and can detect body heat in cold water trace residual heat from discharged firearms and capture the thermal signatures of high speed vehicles Furthermore the drones can fly at very high altitudes operate for long periods of time and function in adverse weather conditions 288 The City uses similar drones for environmental issues such as mountain fires and illegal marine poaching Cape Town's Eye drones deliver high resolution real time intelligence to the city's security agencies and emergency response teams forming an integral part of the city's overall safety and security operations Other forms of technology added recently to the city's safety and security arsenal include dashboard mounted Automated Number Plate Recognition cameras body cams for police officers gunshot detection systems for remote alerts and handheld digital devices which are linked to the city's Emergency Policing Incident Control EPIC system for fast tracked incident logging issuing of fines and uploading of photographic evidence Cape Town continues to modernize its policing systems and in recent years has spent over R 600 million on technological advancements in the security space 264 Many Cape Town residents have access to additional security in the form of private security subscriptions from the likes of large companies with national reach such as Fidelity A DT These companies provide armed response teams for residential crime reduction with private security personnel and vehicles also being stationed around Cape Town neighborhoods for visible localized security A DT also partners with major South African fiber network operator F NO Vu mate l to monitor areas via CCTV and some suburbs ' residents have arranged for cameras to be installed around their houses for 24 7 surveillance to increase local security The city is part of the Public Emergency Call Center 107 network for crime reporting and response 289 Cape Town has been a pioneer with policing and security innovations in South Africa The City runs the country's only police reservist service that is managed by a local government in the form of the Disaster Volunteers and the Law Enforcement Auxiliary Service It was also first to launch specialized policing units including the Gang and Drug Task Team and the Metal Theft Unit 289 The city is also the only metropolitan area in South Africa to use gunfire detection systems in high risk areas and to effectively implement computer aided dispatch and integrated spatially enabled resource management through its award winning EPIC system Furthermore Cape Town employs the largest CCTV network out of all South African cities 289 As with many other forms of infrastructure Cape Town stands out amongst South Africa's metropolitan areas for having a more developed stable energy supply The city is home to the country's only nuclear power station Ko e berg as well as numerous other forms of power generating plants A second nuclear station situated in Duy ne font e in slightly south east of Ko e berg is planned The new plant received Environmental Authorization in 2025 and awaits further statutory approvals by the national government 290 Furthermore Cape Town uses a system of pumped hydro electricity storage at Steen bras to supplement its own power generation and avoid up to 2 stages of load shedding power outages when the rest of the national grid goes down due to insufficient energy to meet demand This results in not only residential homes having more sustained power feeds but also allows commercial and industrial operations to continue when other major areas in the country are without power boosting Cape Town's economic output In January 2024 it was reported that the City of Cape Town intended to leave national energy operator Esko m behind and become completely energy self sustaining Through adding 650 MW of independent power to the city's grid Cape Town aims to protect itself against the first 4 stages of Esko m load shedding by 2026 with the goal of eventually becoming entirely self sufficient meeting its own electricity demand The closing date for tender submissions for this project was 8 April 2024 291 The City aims to procure power from existing generators and will follow a two pronged structure allowing bidders to supplement dispatch able or reserve power with an optional self dispatch able component the latter being at a lower cost than the prevailing Esko m Mega flex Tariff 291 Cape Town was able to go ahead with this plan after successful advocacy to the national government for the integration of independent power producers IP Ps into the national grid The City of Cape Town took the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy D MRE and the National Energy Regulator of South Africa Ne rsa to court after Ne rsa said it could not allow for independent power production unless the Ministry made changes 292 Cape Town's progress with a holistic energy plan detached from Esko m was achieved following the gazetting of amendments to the electricity regulations for new electricity generation capacity in 2020 by then Mineral Resources and Energy Minister G we de Mantas he 292 The new regulations opened the way for municipalities in good financial standing to develop their own power generation projects President Rama ph osa announced the changes in a speech to Parliament in the same year which marked the first time municipalities were allowed to buy energy from sources other than state owned Esko m's monopolistic system 292 Recent and in progress power diversification methods include 291 The City of Cape Town announced a Cash for Power program in 2024 as part of its overall Energy Strategy The program allows for Cape Town households to earn money for selling excess power they generate via solar panels back to the city's grid a first for South Africa The City opened applications for residential households to feed power into the grid by means of grid tied solar photovoltaic PV systems and bi directional meters 293 During the announcement speech Cape Town's Mayor also criticized the national government andEs kom for not fixing the load shedding problems in South Africa and said that Cape Town would not wait for matters with the national grid to be fixed with the City instead making its own power generation plans 293 Cape Town has South Africa's most advanced plans to buy power on the open market In February 2025 the city announced that its Cash for Power program had 1 842 active participants and had paid out over R 55 million to its residents and businesses as part of the program via credits applied to their municipal energy bills 1 090 small scale generators sellers were residential customers and 752 were commercial or industrial The city also stated that it was on track to double the pay out s in the program's second year of operation 294 The City further stated that it had launched an online system for registering solar PV systems for the program and announced unveiled a cheaper bi directional meter to feed power back into the grid Customers can offset their electricity bills without registering for the Cash for Power program However registering allows them to go into a credit status with the City paying them back for any excess power generation 294 In 2025 the conclusion of a year long electricity wheeling pilot project was announced 562 800 kWh of renewable electricity was successfully wheeled during the pilot En power Trading Et an a Energy and E quite s Fund Property were the traders for the process Cape Town Mayor Geordi n Hill Lewis announced that the city would enter the next phase of the project whereby it would promote the scaling up of power trading across Cape Town's electricity grid based on bilateral and multilateral trading agreements 295 The Mayor described the milestone as an exciting leap forward to diversify Cape Town's electricity supplier base beyond Esko m and towards a future of decentralized electricity trading in South Africa 295 In June 2025 the City of Cape Town's Atlantis solar PV plant had finished the installation of around 2 400 solar panels out of a planned 12 850 panels as part of a R 200 million renewable energy project City of Cape Town Energy ME C X an the a Limber g stated that the Atlantis site would operate as a hybrid plant alongside the city's first utility scale battery storage operation totaling 8 MW There are plans for a 60 MW solar plant to be built at Paa rde vlei which is expected to provide sufficient protection from one stage of Esko m load shedding 296 Cape Town has a goal of net zero carbon municipal buildings by 2030 as well as a goal for alternative energy to meet 35 of the city's total demand by 2030 296 The city's changes to its power infrastructure represent major changes in South Africa's overall electricity network including a shift towards green energy the integration of wheeling processes a move towards energy diversification as a reaction to rising Esko m tariffs and shorter term flexible contracts in a merchant market providing businesses with easier methods to source stable power 297 The Western Cape Water Supply System WCW S S is a complex water supply system in the Western Cape region of South Africa comprising an inter linked system of six main dams pipelines tunnels and distribution networks and a number of minor dams some owned and operated by the Department of Water and Sanitation and some by the City of Cape Town 298 The Cape Town water crisis of 2017 to 2018 was a period of severe water shortage in the Western Cape region most notably affecting the City of Cape Town While dam water levels had been declining since 2015 the Cape Town water crisis peaked during mid 2017 to mid 2018 when water levels hovered between 15 and 30 percent of total dam capacity In late 2017 there were first mentions of plans for Day Zero a shorthand reference for the day when the water level of the major dams supplying the city could fall below 13 5 percent 299 300 301 Day Zero would mark the start of Level 7 water restrictions when municipal water supplies would be largely switched off and it was envisioned that residents could have to queue for their daily ration of water If this had occurred it would have made the City of Cape Town the first major city in the world to run out of water 302 303 The city of Cape Town implemented significant water restrictions in a bid to curb water usage and succeeded in reducing its daily water usage by more than half to around 500 million litres 130 000 000 US gal per day in March 2018 304 The fall in water usage led the city to postpone its estimate for Day Zero and strong rains starting in June 2018 led to dam levels recovering 305 In September 2018 with dam levels close to 70 percent the city began easing water restrictions indicating that the worst of the water crisis was over 306 Good rains in 2020 effectively broke the drought and resulting water shortage when dam levels reached 95 percent 307 Concerns have been raised however that un sustain ble demand and limited water supply could result in future drought events 308 The City of Cape Town has mapped out a New Water Program and Water Strategy which plan to add 300 million litres of water per day to the city's supply through measures including desalination tapping into groundwater and clearing invasive species 309 In mid 2024 the Cape Town municipality stated that it was embarking on an infrastructure stability program which involves refurbishing infrastructure and building new capacity with funds for the program already having been added to the city's budget 310 The City of Cape Town announced in 2024 that it planned to build a desalination plant to further strengthen Cape Town's water supply A feasibility study was planned to be completed in 2025 The facility is expected to produce between 50 million and 70 million litres of water a day with a targeted starting date of 2030 309 The plant will be located on undeveloped land at the intersection of the R 27 and N 1 in the vicinity of the Port of Cape Town The city is undertaking an environmental impact assessment process for the project 310 City of Cape Town Water and Sanitation MM C Zahid Bad roo dien stated that the proposed Pa arden Island desalination plant would feature a 22 000 square meter sea water reverse osmosis operation for use by Cape Town households The estimated capital cost of the plant was roughly R 5 billion excluding VAT and will be funded through the city's water tariff 309 As part of Cape Town's Vision 2050 project the City aims to significantly upgrade its infrastructure The 25 year project unveiled by the City in mid 2025 was opened for public comment for a period of around 2 months At the time Cape Town's Mayor stated that the project's over arching goal was for Cape Town to remain a future fit city of opportunities for all 75 of the project's goals will directly benefit lower income households 311 Some of Vision 2050's aims include 311 312 Cape Town International Airport

of the five candidate cities shortlisted by the IOC to launch official candidature s to host the 2004 Summer Olympics Although the Games ultimately went to Athens Cape Town came in third place There has been some speculation that Cape Town was seeking the South African Olympic Committee's nomination to be South Africa's bid city for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games 368 That was quashed when the International Olympic Committee awarded the 2020 Games to Tokyo The city of Cape Town has vast experience in hosting major national and international sports events The Cape Town Cycle Tour is the

Cape Town The Clovelly Country Club and Metropolitan Golf Club have 18 holes 370 The coastline of Cape Town is relatively long and the varied exposure to weather conditions makes it fairly common for water conditions to be conducive to recreational scuba diving at some part of the city's coast There is considerable variation in the underwater environment and regional ecology as there are dive sites on reefs and wrecks on both sides of the Cape Peninsula and False Bay split between two coastal marine ecoregions by the Cape Peninsula and also variable by depth zone False Bay is open to the south and the prevailing open ocean swell arrives from the southwest so the exposure varies considerably around the coastline The inshore ba thyme try near Cape Point is shallow enough for a moderate amount of refraction of long period swell but deep enough to have less effect on short period swell and acts as a filter to pass mainly the longer swell components to the Western shores although they are significantly attenuated The eastern shores get more of the open ocean spectrum and this results in very different swell conditions between the two sides at any given time The fetch is generally too short for southeasterly winds to produce good surf There are more than 20 named breaks in False Bay The north wester can have a long fetch and can produce large waves but they may also be associated with local wind and be very poorly sorted The Atlantic coast is exposed to the full power of the South westerly swell produced by the westerly winds of the southern ocean often a long way away so the swell has time to separate into similar wavelengths and there are some world class big wave breaks among the named breaks of the Atlantic shore 371 372 373 In the 1950 s the city was part of four editions of the famous Algiers Cape Town Rally during the pioneer years of trans Africa rallying and motor exploration The closing of the road to the newly founded Zaire caused the city to be dropped from the t raj ect 374 Cape Town is also home to Zee ko e vlei a fresh water lake near the False Bay coast Its primary use is for sailing and rowing Zee ko e vlei is the home of the Zee ko e
