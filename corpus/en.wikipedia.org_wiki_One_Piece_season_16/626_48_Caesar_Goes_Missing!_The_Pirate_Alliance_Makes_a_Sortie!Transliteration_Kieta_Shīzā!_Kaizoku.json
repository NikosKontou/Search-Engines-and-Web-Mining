During the dead of night, a group of sea creatures led by a pirate named Breed attacks and abducts Caesar and takes him to his island-sized ship. When Luffy, Law, and Chopper set out in theShark Submerge IIIto retake Ceasar, Law identifies the creatures as Sea Lapahns. When they arrive on the ship they are attacked by the Sea Lapahns, as well as an octopus boxer, black belt penguin, sumo capybara, and a Kung-Fu Dugong that can use Haki. After beating then it is revealed the Kung-Fu Dugong is the same one that became Luffy's disciple in Alabasta. With Chopper translating the Kung-Fu Dugong explains that after being inspired by Luffy he set out to sea and started a pirate crew with the other animals but were enslaved by Breed shortly after arriving in the New World. Breed appears and throws slime that forms a collar around Chopper's neck and forces him to attack Luffy and Law.
