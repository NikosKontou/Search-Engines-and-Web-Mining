Zoro, Sanji and Brook go to look for the samurai, who had gone to look for his torso. The children then start to fall over in pain while asking for candy. Chopper, who tested them for any sickness, reveals that they were drugged and are suffering from withdrawal. They attack the Straw Hats, who can't fight back without injuring the children, so Usopp puts them to sleep. Back in the lab, Law gives Smoker's heart to Caesar, who sent the Yeti Cool Brothers to deal with the Straw Hats. The Brothers are then shown talking to each other while Zoro, Sanji and Brook lie unconscious nearby.",
