Rufi to Rō Dai-Dasshutsu\" (Japanese:反撃開始！ルフィ・ロー大脱出) Aya Komaki Jin Tanaka July 7, 2013(2013-07-07) January 29, 2023\n\nAs the Underworld Brokers watched the video feed of the captive Straw Hats and Marines, Eustass Kid (whose has a mechanical prosthetic left arm) and Killer decided to ignore it for more important matters, such as forming an alliance between the Kid Pirates, On Air Pirates and the Hawkins Pirates. Law then decided to set his plan into motion and orders Franky to blow a fireball at a destroyed ship, creating enough smoke to block the cage from being seen from outside. Law then breaks free, explaining that he switched the sea prism stones with fakes during his stay on the island, and proceeds to free the others and restoring Tashigi and Smoker in their own bodies while securing their aid. Franky however had to leave them and protect theThousand Sunny. Meanwhile, Zoro and Nami's group are still running away from Shinokuni, and they manage to join up while escaping. Luffy's group managed to enter the lab with the aid of Law, and they opened the gate, allowing the G-5 Marines to get in before closing the gate, but the rest of the Straw Hats were still outside. Seeing their only chance of hope closing, Zoro and Kin'emon effortlessly cut the gate open, getting everyone inside safely.",
