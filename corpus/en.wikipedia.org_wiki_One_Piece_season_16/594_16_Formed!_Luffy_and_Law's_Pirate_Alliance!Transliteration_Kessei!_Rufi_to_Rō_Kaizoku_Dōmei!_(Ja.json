Law returns Franky and Chopper back to their bodies while Nami ends up in Sanji's body because Sanji is far away with Zoro and Brook. Law tells them that they can't go back once things start moving for example capturing Caesar Clown who has the Gas-Gas Fruit. He warns them that he is highly dangerous therefore, they need Haki users to beat him. Luffy says that the Haki users there are him, Law, Zoro and Sanji. The marines are continuing their fight against Caesar's men. The three centaurs open the door and see a big glop of Slime that seeps out poison gas, most of them die and two survive so they run as it chases them. Caesar calls the pet slime monster Smiley and says that the Straw Hats and the G-5 marines are being used as test subjects for it.",
