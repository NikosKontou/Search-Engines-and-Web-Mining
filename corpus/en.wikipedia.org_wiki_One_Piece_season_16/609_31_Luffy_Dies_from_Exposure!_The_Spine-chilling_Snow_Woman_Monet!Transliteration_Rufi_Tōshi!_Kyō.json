Meanwhile, Luffy faces Monet off and almost dies in the battle, due to having his body frozen, but recovers and counters with Haki. The counterattack, however, made a hole in the floor, leading to the garbage room, where Luffy fell to, and Monet gives farewell to him, as \"he can only escape flying\". Trafalgar Law prepares to attack the SAD Room, but is confronted by Vergo, who gives critical punches with his Haki-powered fists and bamboo. In the biscuit room, Monet prevents Mocha from fleeing with the candy, and the Straw Hats also help Mocha. After seriously wounding Law, Vergo is confronted by Vice-Admiral Smoker, who prepares to fight the other Vice-Admiral.",
