Aokiji tai Dofuramingo\" (Japanese:緊迫！青キジVSドフラミンゴ) Tetsuya Endō Yoshiyuki Suga December 15, 2013(2013-12-15) July 30, 2023\n\nDoflamingo prepares to finish Smoker off but is stopped by Kuzan's ice which freezes everything around the Warlord, including himself. But he manages to break free from the ice before freezing completely. After some talk, Doflamingo leaves with Baby 5 and Buffalo back to Dressrosa, as Kuzan asks for G-5 to treat Smoker. After getting treated, Smoker starts talking with Kuzan about the Marines and Underworld, insinuating that the former Admiral has \"business unseen to the government\". At the Thousand Sunny, Law tells some details about the recently formed pirate alliance, which makes some of them afraid of being targeted by an Emperor due to holding Caesar Clown captive. After having some fun, Momonosuke is introduced to the Straw Hats ship by Nami, which makes Sanji, Kin'emon, and Brook jealous of his \"luck\" with women. At night, a mysterious figure is seen making contact with Kung-Fu Dugongs that have just found the Straw Hat pirates.",
