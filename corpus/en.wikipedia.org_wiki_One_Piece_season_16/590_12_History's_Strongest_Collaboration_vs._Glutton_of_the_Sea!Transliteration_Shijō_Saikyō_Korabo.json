The Akami appears and attacksMr. Satan, Usopp andGohan, poisoning them and absorbing their energy, before disappearing again; This leaves the group with only 30 minutes to find Akami and create an antidote to its poison. After defeating Sanji,Piccolo, Franky,Gotenksand others, Akami evolves into an even more powerful monster, even gaining the ability to absorb and use the power of energy attacks intended to stop it.
