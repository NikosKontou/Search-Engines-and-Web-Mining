Luffy in his enthusiasm, votes to go to the island, though most of his crew are reluctant to go with him. The crew than receives a distress call from someone on the island who is being attacked by a samurai. They then draw sticks on who will go with Luffy, and who will stay on the ship, with Zoro, Robin, and Usopp coming with Luffy.
