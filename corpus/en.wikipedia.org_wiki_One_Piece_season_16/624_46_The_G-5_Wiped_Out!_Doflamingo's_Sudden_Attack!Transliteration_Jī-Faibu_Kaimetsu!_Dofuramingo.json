Dofuramingo Kyūshū!\" (Japanese:G5壊滅！ドフラミンゴ急襲！) Masahiro Hosoda Jin Tanaka December 8, 2013(2013-12-08) July 23, 2023\n\nOn Punk Hazard, Caesar's former minions go in search of those who were petrified by Shinokuni. All of a sudden, Doflamingo appears from the sky and throws Baby 5 and Buffalo's heads back onto their body. Before any of the G-5 soldiers could attack, Doflamingo used Conqueror's Haki and knocked out a very large majority of them. Even then, the remaining soldier couldn't move because of his devil fruit powers. Doflamingo even has some of the G-5 soldiers kill each other demanding the whereabouts of Law. Smoker steps into the fight, launching White Blow at Doflamingo. As the fight progressed, some G-5 soldiers decided to aid Smoker. Doflamingo moved to confront the soldiers, but his attack hit Smoker instead as he was moving to defend the soldiers and was severely injured. On the Sunny, Luffy asks why they are going to Dressrosa. Law states he has business to attend to. All of a sudden, the sea currents start to shift at an angle as they slide down a sea slope. After they get out of rough water, Luffy explains to the crew about the alliance and the plan to kill Kaido. Back on Punk Hazard, Doflamingo is about to unleash the final blow onto Smoker. Then, Kuzan appears and asks Doflamingo to step aside as Smoker's friend.",
