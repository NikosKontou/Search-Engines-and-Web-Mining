In a flashback, she and Sind were on a ship fleeing the poison gas. Mocha cried about missing her family, and Sind tried to comfort her, though he cried too. Caesar later found them and lied, claiming his own son died from the gas and that he wanted to save children from the same fate. As Mocha tries to protect the others, Monet recalls introducing new children in another flashback. Zoro fights Monet while Nami, Robin, and Chopper pursue Mocha. Monet uses her snow powers to attack, but Zoro blocks her strike meant for Nami. She aims to eliminate the weaker Straw Hats as a tactical move. Monet entraps them with a snow wall and nearly bites Nami, but Robin stops her. Zoro then opens a path for the others to escape. Elsewhere, Luffy and Momonosuke fall back down the garbage chute. Caesar watches the chaos and seesShinokunientering the lab as part of his plan, expecting everyone to die soon. Usopp, Kin'emon, and Brook flee the gas while searching for seastone cuffs and Momonosuke. Monet questions why Zoro won't attack her. Sanji and the G-5 arrive, with Sanji teasing Zoro before admiring Monet — until she bites some Marines, causing panic. Sanji flees with the G-5, but Tashigi stays to help Zoro battle Monet.",
