Ichimi Sentō Kaishi\" (Japanese:子供達を救え！一味戦闘開始) Aya Komaki Yoshiyuki Suga February 3, 2013(2013-02-03) September 25, 2022\n\nThe Straw Hats who escaped the prison cell end up in the Biscuit Room where they find a group of children. The samurai head scares the children. The hazmat suit guys arrive and attempt to capture the Straw Hats. Meanwhile, in Luffy's group, Usopp makes a banana boat so they can cross the river to the frozen side of Punk Hazard. Then, the centaur whom Luffy beat earlier tells his boss that the Straw Hats are heading to the frozen side of Punk Hazard. Back in Nami's group, the children beg the Straw Hats to save them as they have been on the island for over a year and want to go home. Nami's unwillingness to abandon them convinces the others to rescue them as they fight off the hazmat suit guys.",
