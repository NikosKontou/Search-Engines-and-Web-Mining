    "transformers_text": "Roro no a Zoro Roro no a Zoro spelled as Roro no a Zo lo in some English adaptations also known as Pirate Hunter Zoro Kai z oku Gari no Zoro is a fictional character in the manga series and media franchise One Piece created by Eiichiro Oda The character made his first appearance in the 3 rd chapter of the series which was first published in Japan in Shueisha's Weekly Sh nen Jump magazine on August 4 1997 Zoro is the second member of the Straw Hat Pirates and the first to join doing so after he is rescued by Monkey D Luffy from execution He is a highly skilled swordsman and serves as the crew's combatant a He possesses an extremely poor sense of direction which is a running gag throughout the series Zoro originally used two swords instead of three 4 and was originally planned to be part of Buggy the Clown's pirate crew and would have been recruited by Luffy away from Buggy Zoro's surname Roro no a is based on the Japanese pronunciation of French pirate Fran ois l ' Ol onna is's name In several Western adaptations his name was spelled as Zo lo Zoro commonly wears a plain white shirt though he can be seen wearing other types of shirts black pants and a light green hara maki sash that holds his three swords These swords ' names are Enma Wado Ichi mon ji and S and a i Kite tsu Zoro also has a black bandanna tied around his left bicep that he only wears on his head while in a serious battle This bandana was inspired by Nobuhiro Wat suki one of Oda's best friends and his mentor as well as aspects of his character Under his shirt his torso is heavily scarred from many of the battles he has fought especially since he joined the Straw Hats like the one acquired during the battle against Dracul e Mi hawk one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea He has three golden earrings in his left ear which denote his style of combat using three swords After a two year time skip Zoro has a scar across his left eye obtained during his training under Dracul e Mi hawk although not confirmed by the anime and replaces his shirt with a long dark green samurai's coat which he opens the torso while fighting against the New Fish man Pirates or when he experiences heat burning side of Punk Hazard Concerning his ethnic appearance Oda stated that he imagines Zoro to be of Japanese descent albeit in a real world context 5 Zoro has many scars on his body The most noticeable is the long scar running down his left eye which is the one he got after returning from the two year time skip It is currently unknown how he acquired it but he either can't or won't open his left eye because of it He also has a heavily scarred torso having a diagonal cut mark from the top left to the bottom right of his torso due to fighting Dracul e Mi hawk He also has scars on both of his ankles which he obtained from trying to cut his own legs off to escape the candle prison of Mr 3 in Little Garden In the original Japanese version of the One Piece anime series Zoro is voiced by Kazuya Nakai as an adult and Meg umi Urawa as a child In the first OVA Defeat Him The Pirate Gan zack from 1998 is voiced by Wataru Takagi In Ode x's dubs of the first 104 episodes of One Piece in Singapore Zoro was voiced by Brian Zimmerman In the 4 kids Entertainment's dub of the first 104 episodes of One Piece Zoro was renamed Zo lo which was later implemented in the Viz Media adaption of the manga series he was voiced by Marc Di raison and Andrew Rann ells as a child In Funimation Entertainment's dubs of the entire One Piece franchise adult Zoro is voiced by Christopher Sab at with Cynthia Cr anz playing the role of child Zoro for episode 2 and by Brin a Pale nci a for the rest of the franchise Sab at compared Zoro's characterization with Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle's Kur ogane and YuYu Hakusho's Kazuma K uwa bara describing them as the tough guy with a heart of gold As a result Sab at feared that he sometimes performs similar voices despite the fact that the characters are different He also tried seeing the original actors ' works to avoid getting a more specific delivery 6 In the game One Piece Unlimited Adventure Sab at reprises his role as adult Zoro with child Zoro voiced by Aaron D is muk e Zoro is portrayed by Mac ken yu in the live action adaptation of One Piece 7 while Maximilian Lee Piazza portrays young Zoro Zoro is a confident and serious individual who tends to act impulsively like his captain He responds in a comical short tempered way towards minor conflicts A running gag is that he always gets lost even when shown where to go having gotten lost even while walking in a straight line he is very insecure about this and always blames someone else While the crew is out at sea Zoro can usually be found sleeping or training towards his goal of becoming the world's best swordsman He and Sanji have a great rivalry often resorting to fighting and insults over the most minuscule of problems He never calls Sanji by his name in the original Japanese manga he uses phrases like dumb cook etc Sanji calls him phrases like mar imo moss head etc Though not a samurai he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido and is frequently mistaken for one Unlike Luffy and most of the Straw Hat Pirates Zoro has killed his opponents if it is necessary though never in cold blood Zoro enjoys fighting a strong opponent and he usually faces down the second strongest villain in each arc Zoro tends to have a maniacal grin and serious glare when battling a worthy opponent On the ship he normally either trains with weights or sleeps The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength and maintaining a lookout in the ship's crow's nest which on the Thousand Sunny also doubles as his gym He also likes sake almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat but like Nami he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly high endurance and tolerance for alcohol Despite his poor sense of direction he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger and react He is often displayed as being well aware of dangerous situations and the people around him Despite his stern personality Zoro had a strong sense of loyalty and mutual respect towards his crew mates when accomplishing their dreams After his humiliating loss to Dracul e Mi hawk Zoro pledged his loyalty to Luffy as his captain vowing that he will never lose again As Luffy's first mate Zoro often reminds others of the harsh reality of a sudden situation which shocks some other crew members although they usually decide he is right Zoro insisted that Us opp apologize to his crew mates before he returned to the Straw Hats from an internal conflict he caused displaying emotional maturity Zoro has stated that he does not pray to any god does not care one way or the other and has never believed in anything except himself and for him only one man is above him his captain Luffy He has also stated that he would follow Luffy till the end of his journey becoming the King of the Pirates but Luffy should not come between him and his dream either becoming the world's strongest swordsman and surpassing Dracul e Mi hawk in the process Zoro knows he still has much untapped potential and is constantly seen training and improving his fighting skills He adheres to a sword master's code of honor and never brags or lies about his abilities and outright admitting a weakness even to an enemy He never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics He is proficient in Armament and Observation Hak i and is one of the few known characters who possess Conqueror's Hak i During his battle against King Zoro unlocks an advanced form of Conqueror Hak i which allows him to coat his swords with it similar to Armament Hak i which could further enhance his attacks Although it hasn't been confirmed Zoro is heavily linked with conqueror Hak i by the beast pirate captain himself after the wound he gave him He also uses an advanced form of Armament Hak i to shoot a short blast of Hak i from a distance 8 Roro no a Zoro first appears in the manga chapter Enter Pirate Hunter Zoro Kai z oku gari no Zoro T j first published in Japan's Weekly Sh nen Jump magazine on August 4 1997 9 He first appears as a captured criminal awaiting his execution at the hands of the Marines having offended Helm ep po by killing his pet wolf 9 Before the beginning of the series ' narrative Zoro made a pact with his childhood friend Kuina vowing to become the strongest swordsman in the world only for Kuina to pass away the next day from an accident 10 For years Zoro hunts pirates as a bounty hunter for a living alongside friends Johnny and Yo s aku after getting lost trying to locate Dracul e Mi hawk When Luffy offers Zoro the opportunity to join his crew Zoro initially refuses But after Luffy saves him from execution Zoro pledges loyalty to him Zoro locates Mi hawk at the Bara tie in a chance encounter where he is easily defeated but nevertheless impresses the latter 11 Zoro's loyalty to Luffy is incomparable among the crew and develops through the series Even though he joined Luffy's crew his main goal was to become the strongest swordsman Originally Zoro threatened to kill Luffy if he ever got in the way of this goal He listens to his captain's order and follows the order until the very end On Jaya Zoro followed Luffy's orders not to fight an enemy in a bar no matter what and followed it without hesitation After fighting Daz Bone z in A la bast a Zoro's bounty is initially set at 60 000 000 but is later raised to 120 000 000 after fighting the World Government at Eni es Lobby At Water 7 Zoro upholds the authority of Luffy as captain during Luffy's fight with Us opp and Us opp's leaving of the crew Zoro pointedly refuses to allow Us opp to rejoin the crew without an apology and threatens to be the next to leave because letting Us opp back as if nothing happened was an insult to Luffy's authority as captain 12 At Thriller Bark Bartholomew Kuma knocked out the Straw Hats with Zoro trying to save Luffy and Sanji to no avail as none of the pirates were aware of Kuma's intentions of having them separated to train for the New World far away 12 Zoro encounters Mi hawk again and trains under him for two years before reuniting with the crew He receives a bounty of 320 000 000 after cutting up an antagonist as large as a mountain and assisting Luffy at the end of Do flamingo's tyrannical rule of Dress rosa After

father Roro no a Arashi was killed by pirates and his mother Tera died of illness when he was young Zoro is a descendant of the S him o tsuki family of Wa no Country through his grandmother Fu riko
