and goal reflects the three main themes of One Piece dreams freedom and friendship 4 Though Brook did not appear in the story until 2007 the idea of a skeleton musician was first conceived by Oda in 2000 about the time of La boon's introduction This was seven years before the first appearance of Brook 5 6 Oda's concept art shows Brook originally had a western cowboy hat instead of an afro This design was later incorporated as York i's cowboy hat instead 7 Brook is a combination of a gentlemanly person a and a perverted sort He speaks in a dignified educated manner at most times but has amazingly bad manners He burps and farts at dinner casually asks to see womens ' panties and picks in other peoples ' food to name only a few He takes being a skeleton lightly using any chance he can to joke about it However his backstory from Thriller Bark became the most tragic moment for Brook when he lost his crew mate along the journey before being stranded at the Florian Triangle Brook

reuniting with La boon after his adventure across the Grand Line After the Thriller Bark Arc Brook become loyal to the Straw Hats on accomplishing their dreams Despite his eccentric behavior Brook is shown to be extremely upright and compassionate person befitting of a true gentleman as Brook utterly disdains wickedness and cruelty Brook ate the Revive Revive Fruit a Paramecia type Devil Fruit which enhances the user's soul to the point where they resurrect after their first death He can possess his own deceased body which allows him to animate his body which he cannot feel injuries or attacks He even demonstrated a new form of Devil Fruit ability that allows his soul to leave the body usually by exiting his mouth and move it everywhere he wants to After his separation from the Straw Hats Brook learns how to use his Devil Fruit ability to leave his skeleton body and explore his surroundings as a disembodied soul ch 629 He even carries a shikomi zu e a Japanese cane sword and is skilled in its use He can also combine his shikomi zu e and violin to create sound based attacks He was once a fighter in the surprise attack squadron of an unknown kingdom Brook claims he can heal from most fractures to his body by drinking milk His head can also be opened up and used as a storage device Brook uses an unnamed fencing sword style and is a skilled fencer who can use quick stabs because of his skeleton anatomy 8 In addition to his sword skill Brook's lightweight skeleton body gives him great speed and the ability to jump extraordinarily high His body is so light that he is even capable of running on water 9 However Brook is still powerless if submerged in water like all Devil Fruit users and will sink if he stops running 10 Brook is an excellent musician displaying the ability to play any instrument at a highly skilled level 11 He is usually seen playing the violin ch 486 Brook can even influence people with his music to the point of making them fall asleep ch 454 While separated from the other Straw Hats and incognito as Soul King Brook he gains world fame filling concert halls with fans ch 600 He is also a skilled fencer who uses a shikomi zu e a Japanese cane sword in battle ch 454 His reduced weight allows him to jump extraordinarily high and to run across water ch 443 493 Eventually Brook learns how to use his Devil Fruit ability to leave his skeleton body and explore his surroundings as a disembodied soul ch 629 Over fifty years ago Brook was once the leader of a battle convoy in a certain kingdom At some point before becoming a pirate Brook was friends with a mysterious little girl named Gun ko who would later be revealed as a World Noble of the Man mayer Family and direct servant to Great Imu Then he became the musician swordsman of the music themed Rumba r Pirates and later Brook took over the crew as the new captain The Rumba r Pirates were all killed but the power of the Paramecia type Revive Revive Fruit Yomi Yomi no Mi allowed Dead Bones Brook to rise again and live a second life as a skeleton ch 443 12 Already pirates before the era of Gold Roger the Rumba r Pirates and the baby whale La boon enter the Grand Line La boon took a particular liking to Humming Brook 's peculiar afro and his enchanting music Promising to return after sailing the Grand Line the crew left La boon with Crocus at the lighthouse at Reverse Mountain stating that the Grand Line is too dangerous for such a small whale 13 The crew captain Calico York i Ky arak o no Y ki is forced to flee the Grand Line after he catches a disease leaving Brook to be captain 9 Brook's crew was slaughtered by an unknown pirate crew after they entered a mysterious misty area of the sea known as the Florian Triangle 9 They played one last song for La boon as they died which Brook recorded with the use of a Tone Dial ch 489 Because Brook ate the Revive Revive Fruit the spirit of his soul returned to the Grand Line However he got lost due to the intense fog in the Florian Triangle After wandering for some time he finally found his body which had decayed to nothing but bleached bones leaving only his afro which remained due to strong roots 9 Brook was returned to life as a walking talking skeleton During the time he spent alone on his former crew's ship he had almost no contact with other human beings leading to eccentric behavior at odds with social norms and a constant urge to make bone jokes and puns Eight years before meeting the Straw Hat crew he was captured by Gecko Moria who stole his shadow and placed it in the body of the legendary samurai R yuma 8 Because he could no longer be exposed to sunlight a side effect of having no shadow in One Piece Brook remains in the Florian Triangle under the protective cover of the thick fog until he meets the Straw Hat Pirates Fifty years later the Straw Hats encounter La boon and Crocus and learn the tale of the Rumba r Pirates as they enter the Grand Line 14 Brook is later introduced as a skeleton inhabiting the region of the Grand Line known as the Florian Triangle Luffy invites Brook to join his crew but Brook declines citing his inability to walk in sunlight due to his stolen shadow After Luffy defeats Moria and returns Brook's shadow Brook joins the Straw Hat crew becoming their musician ch 442 ch 443 13 Even after fifty years Brook's goal is still to fulfill his late crew's promise after the Straw Hat Pirates go through the entirety of the Grand Line ch 459 12 Brook carries a recording of the crew whose last survivors played their cheery song B ink's Sake with their dying breaths He fears La boon will not recognize him since he is all bones and so prizes and protects his distinctive afro Roro no a Zoro and Brook share respect for one another likely because they are both swordsman and in the battle with the flying fish riders in chapter 494 they do a team attack showing their abilities as two skilled swordsmen 15 While separated from the other Straw Hats and incognito as Soul King Brook he gains world fame filling concert halls with fans ch 600 Despite Franky speculating he might not ever return to the pirate life ch 601 Brook rejoins the Straw Hats after it is revealed he is a pirate ch 602 On the elephant island of Zo u Brook and the Straw Hats learn from the elders of the talking animal Mink tribe that to find the One Piece located at Laugh Tale one must find the Four Road Pone glyphs that together reveal the coordinates to Laugh Tale Two of these Road Pone glyphs were being held by two of the four pirate Emperors of the Sea Big Mom and Kai do ch 818 16 Luffy and Brook later infiltrate Whole Cake Island home to Big Mom to recover their crew mate Sanji the cook Brook attempts to steal Big Mom's road pone glyph ch 831 In the process he fights Big Mom and realizes his Devil Fruit matches up well against her Soul Soul power Brook notes that acquiring the Road Pone glyph is crucial because it allows the Straw Hats to win even if Sanji did not return to the crew ch 851 Brook managed to steal a copy of the Road Pone glyph and hide it in his head ch 855 Brook later smashes Big Mom's picture of Mother Caramel one of her only weaknesses ch 863 The success of the raid leads to Luffy being dubbed the Fifth Emperor of the Sea 17 Big Mom and Kai do then form an alliance to take down the Straw Hats but are defeated by the Straw Hats ' Ninja Pirate Mink Samurai Alliance ch 1051 Brook becomes recognized as one of Emperor of the Sea Monkey D Luffy's Senior Officers ch 1058 Brook is featured as a playable character in the video games such as Gear Spirit Unlimited Cruise and the One Piece Pirate Warriors series Brook ranked in the Top 30 of several Sh nen Jump character popularity polls making it to the 26 th position in the worldwide character popularity poll 14 Brook's connection to La boon was called one of the most notable examples of a seemingly innocuous story beat in One Piece becoming important years later but with it involving the backstory of a main character like Brook it's arguably one of the most important 18 Brook was called a perfect illustration of One Piece's brilliance So many characters initially seem silly and wacky but turn out to have tragic back stories which give that wacky presentation a haunting gravity 12",
