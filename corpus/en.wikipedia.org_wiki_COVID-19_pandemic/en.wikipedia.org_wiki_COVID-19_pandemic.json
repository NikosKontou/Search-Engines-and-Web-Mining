    "transformers_text": "The global C OVID 19 pandemic also known as the coronavirus pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 began with an outbreak in Wuhan China in December 2019 Soon afterward it spread to other parts of Asia and then worldwide in early 2020 The World Health Organization WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern PHE IC on 30 January 2020 and assessed it as having become a pandemic on 11 March 3 The WHO declared the public health emergency caused by C OVID 19 had ended in May 2023 4 C OVID 19 symptoms range from a symptomatic to deadly but most commonly include fever sore throat nocturnal cough and fatigue Transmission of the virus is often through airborne particles Mutations have produced many strains variants with varying degrees of infect iv it y and virulence 11 C OVID 19 vaccines were developed rapidly and deployed to the general public beginning in December 2020 made available through government and international programmes such asCO VAX aiming to provide vaccine equity Treatments include novel antiviral drugs and symptom control Common mitigation measures during the public health emergency included travel restrictions lockdown s business restrictions and closures workplace hazard controls mask mandates quarantines testing systems and contact tracing of the infected The pandemic caused severe social and economic disruption around the world including the largest global recession since the Great Depression 12 Widespread supply shortages including food shortages were caused by supply chain disruptions and panic buying Reduced human activity led to an unprecedented temporary decrease in pollution Educational institutions and public areas were partially or fully closed in many jurisdictions and many events were cancelled or postponed during 2020 and 2021 Tele work became much more common for white collar workers as the pandemic evolved Misinformation circulated through social media and occasionally through mass media and political tensions intensified The pandemic raised issues of racial and geographic discrimination health equity and the balance between public health imperatives and individual rights The disease has continued to circulate since 2023 As of 2024 experts were uncertain as to whether it still qualified as a pandemic 13 14 Different definitions of pandemics lead to different determinations of when they end 13 15 As of 5 December 2025 C OVID 19 has caused 7 102 566 5 confirmed deaths and 18 2 to 33 5 million estimated deaths 9 The pandemic ranks as the fifth deadliest pandemic or epidemic in history In epidemiology a pandemic is defined as an epidemic occurring over a very wide area crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people During the C OVID 19 pandemic as with other pandemics the meaning of this term has been challenged 16 The end of a pandemic or other epidemic only rarely involves the total disappearance of a disease and historically much less attention has been given to defining the ends of epidemics than their beginnings The ends of particular epidemics have been defined in a variety of ways differing according to academic field and differently based on location and social group An epidemic's end can be considered a social phenomenon not just a biological one 15 Time reported in March 2024 that expert opinions differ on whether or not C OVID 19 is currently considered endemic or pandemic and that the WHO continued to call the disease a pandemic on its website 13 During the initial outbreak in Wuhan the virus and disease were commonly referred to as coronavirus Wuhan coronavirus 17 the coronavirus outbreak and the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak 18 with the disease sometimes called Wuhan pneumonia 19 20 In January 2020 the WHO recommended 2019 n CoV 21 and 2019 n CoV acute respiratory disease 22 as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 international guidelines against using geographical locations e g Wuhan China animal species or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma 23 WHO finalised the official names C OVID 19 and SARS CoV 2 on 11 February 2020 24 WHO Director General Ted ros G he br eyes us explained CO for corona VI for virus D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified 31 December 2019 25 WHO additionally uses the C OVID 19 virus and the virus responsible for C OVID 19 in public communications 24 WHO named variants of concern and variants of interest using Greek letters The initial practice of naming them according to where the variants were identified e g Delta began as the Indian variant is no longer common 26 A more systematic naming scheme reflects the variant ' sPAN GO lineage e g Omicron's lineage is B 1 1 529 and is used for other variants 27 28 29 SARS CoV 2 is a virus closely related to bat coronavirus es 30 pangolin coronavirus es 31 32 and SARS CoV 33 The first known outbreak the 2019 2020 C OVID 19 outbreak in mainland China started in Wuhan Hubei China in December 2019 34 Many early cases were linked to people who had visited the Huan an Seafood Wholesale Market there 35 36 37 but it is possible that human to human transmission began earlier 38 39 Molecular clock analysis suggests that the first cases were likely to have been between October and November 2019 40 The scientific consensus is that the virus is most likely of a zoonotic origin from bats or another closely related mammal 38 41 42 While other explanations such as speculations that SARS CoV 2 was accidentally released from a laboratory have been proposed 43 44 45 as of 2021 these were not sufficiently supported by evidence 46 Official case counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for C OVID 19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols whether or not they experienced symptomatic disease 47 48 Due to the effect of sampling bias studies which obtain a more accurate number by extrapolating from a random sample have consistently found that total infections considerably exceed the reported case counts 49 50 Many countries early on had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms 51 52 The strongest risk factors for severe illness are obesity complications of diabetes anxiety disorders and the total number of conditions 53 During the start of the C OVID 19 pandemic it was not clear whether young people were less likely to be infected or less likely to develop symptoms and be tested 54 A retrospective cohort study in China found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected 55 Among more thorough studies preliminary results from 9 April 2020 found that in Gan gelt the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany 15 per cent of a population sample tested positive for antibodies 56 Screening for C OVID 19 in pregnant women in New York City and blood donors in the Netherlands found rates of positive antibody tests that indicated more infections than reported 57 58 S ero prevalence based estimates are conservative as some studies show that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies 59 Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number R 0 for C OVID 19 in January 2020 were between 1 4 and 2 5 60 but a subsequent analysis claimed that it may be about 5 7 with a 95 per cent confidence interval of 3 8 to 8 9 61 In December 2021 the number of cases continued to climb due to several factors including new C OVID 19 variants As of that 28 December 282 790 822 individuals worldwide had been confirmed as infected 62 As of 14 April 2022 update over 500 million cases were confirmed globally 63 Most cases are unconfirmed with the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimating the true number of cases as of early 2022 to be in the billions 64 65 One measure that public health officials and policymakers have used to monitor the pandemic and guide decision making is the test positiv it y rate percent positive According to Johns Hopkins in 2020 one benchmark for a too high per cent positive is 5 which was used by the WHO in the past 66 As of 10 March 2023 more than 6 88 million 10 deaths had been attributed to C OVID 19 The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020 68 These numbers vary by region and over time influenced by testing volume healthcare system quality treatment options government response 69 time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age sex and overall health 70 Multiple measures are used to quantify mortality 71 Official death counts typically include people who died after testing positive Such counts exclude deaths without a test 72 Conversely deaths of people who died from underlying conditions following a positive test may be included 73 Countries such as Belgium include deaths from suspected cases including those without a test there by increasing counts 74 Official death counts have been claimed to under report the actual death toll because excess mortality the number of deaths in a period compared to a long term average data show an increase in deaths that is not explained by C OVID 19 deaths alone 75 Using such data estimates of the true number of deaths from C OVID 19 worldwide have included a range from 18 2 to 33 5 million 27 4 million by 18 November 2023 by The Economist 9 75 as well as over 18 5 million by 1 April 2023 by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 76 and 18 2 million earlier deaths between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021 by a comprehensive international study 77 Such deaths include deaths due to healthcare capacity constraints and priorities as well as reluctance to seek care to avoid possible infection 78 Further research may help distinguish the proportions directly caused by C OVID 19 from those caused by indirect consequences of the pandemic 77 In May 2022 the WHO estimated the number of excess deaths by the end of 2021 to be 14 9 million compared to 5 4 million reported C OVID 19 deaths with the majority of the un reported 9 5 million deaths believed to be direct deaths due the virus rather than indirect deaths Some deaths were because people with other conditions could not access medical services 79 80 A December 2022 WHO study estimated excess deaths from the pandemic during 2020 and 2021 again concluding 14 8 million excess early deaths occurred reaffirming and detailing their prior calculations from May as well as updating them addressing criticisms These numbers do not include measures like years of potential life lost and may make the pandemic 2021's leading cause of death 81 82 67 The time between symptom onset and death ranges from 6 to 41 days typically about 14 days 83 Mortality rates increase as a function of age People at the greatest mortality risk are the elderly and those with underlying conditions 84 85 The infection fatality ratio IFR is the cumulative number of deaths attributed to the disease divided by the cumulative number of infected individuals including a symptomatic and undiagnosed infections and excluding vaccinated infected individuals 87 88 89 It is expressed in percentage points 90 Other studies refer to this metric as the infection fatality risk 91 92 In November 2020 a review article in Nature reported estimates of population weighted I FRs for various countries excluding deaths in elderly care facilities and found a median range of 0 24 to 1 49 93 I FRs rise as a function of age from 0 002 at age 10 and 0 01 at age 25 to 0 4 at age 55 1 4 at age 65 4 6 at age 75 and 15 at age 85 These rates vary by a factor of 10 000 across the age groups 86 For comparison the IFR for middle aged adults is two orders of magnitude higher than the annual is ed risk of a fatal automobile accident and much higher than the risk of dying from seasonal influenza 86 In December 2020 a systematic review and meta analysis estimated that population weighted IFR was 0 5 to 1 in some countries France Netherlands New Zealand and Portugal 1 to 2 in other countries Australia England Lithuania and Spain and about 2 5 in Italy This study reported that most of the differences reflected corresponding differences in the population's age structure and the age specific pattern of infections 86 There have also been reviews that have compared the fatality rate of this pandemic with prior pandemics such as MERS CoV 94 For comparison the infection mortality rate of seasonal flu in the United States is 0 1 which is 13 times lower than C OVID 19 95 Another metric in assessing death rate is the case fatality ratio CFR a which is the ratio of deaths to diagnoses This metric can be misleading because of the delay between symptom onset and death and because testing focuses on symptomatic individuals 96 Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics the global CFR was 1 02 percent 6 881 955 deaths for 676 609 955 cases as of 10 March 2023 10 The number varies by region and has generally declined over time 97 Several variants have been named by WHO and labelled as a variant of concern VoC or a variant of interest Vo I Many of these variants have shared the more infectious D 614 G As of May 2023 the WHO had downgraded all variants of concern to previously circulating as these were no longer detected in new infections 98 99 Sub lineages of the Omicron variant BA 1 BA 5 were considered separate VoC s by the WHO until they were downgraded in March 2023 as no longer widely circulating 99 As of 24 September 2024 update the variants of interest as specified by the WHO are BA 2 86 and JN 1 and the variants under monitoring are JN 1 7 KP 2 KP 3 KP 3 1 1 JN 1 18 LB 1 and X EC 100 Symptoms of C OVID 19 are variable ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness 103 104 Common symptoms include headache loss of smell and taste nasal congestion and runny nose cough muscle pain sore throat fever diarrhoea and breathing difficulties 103 People with the same infection may have different symptoms and their symptoms may change over time Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified one respiratory symptom cluster with cough sputum shortness of breath and fever a mus cul o skeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain headache and fatigue a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain vomiting and diarrhoea 105 In people without prior ear nose and throat disorders loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with C OVID 19 and is reported in as many as 88 of cases 106 107 108 The disease is mainly transmitted via the respiratory route when people inhale droplets and small airborne particles that form an aerosol that infected people exhale as they breathe talk cough sneeze or sing 109 110 111 112 Infected people are more likely to transmit C OVID 19 when they are physically close to other non infected individuals However infection can occur over longer distances particularly indoors 109 113 SARS CoV 2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronavirus es 114 It is a positive sense single stranded RNA s s RNA virus with a single linear RNA segment Coronavirus es infect humans other mammals including livestock and companion animals and avian species 115 Human coronavirus es are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS fatality rate 34 SARS CoV 2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people after 229 E NL 63 OC 43 H KU 1 MERS CoV and the original SARS CoV 116 The standard method of testing for presence of SARS CoV 2 is a nucleic acid test 117 which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments 118 As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus its ability to determine duration of infect iv it y of patients is limited 119 The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by an a so pharyngeal swab however a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used 120 121 The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease 122 Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated staying at home or spending more time outdoors avoiding crowded places keeping distance from others wearing a mask in public ventilating indoor spaces managing potential exposure durations washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds practising good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes nose or mouth with unwashed hands 123 124 Those diagnosed with C OVID 19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by healthcare authorities to stay home except to get medical care call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items 125 126 127 A C OVID 19 vaccine is intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 C OVID 19 Prior to the C OVID 19 pandemic an established body of knowledge existed about the structure and function of coronavirus es causing diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS This knowledge accelerated the development of various vaccine platforms during early 2020 128 The initial focus of SARS CoV 2 vaccines was on preventing symptomatic and severe illness 129 The C OVID 19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the severity and death caused by C OVID 19 130 131 As of March 2023 more than 5 5 billion people had received one or more doses 132 11 8 billion in total in over 197 countries The Oxford Astra Zen eca vaccine was the most widely used 133 According to a June 2022 study C OVID 19 vaccines prevented an additional 14 4 million to 19 8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021 134 135 On 8 November 2022 the first recombinant protein based C OVID 19 vaccine Nova vax's booster Nuva x ovid was authorised for use in adults in the United Kingdom It has subsequently received endorsement authorisation from the WHO US European Union and Australia 136 137 On 12 November 2022 the WHO released its Global Vaccine Market Report The report indicated that inequitable distribution is not unique to C OVID 19 vaccines countries that are not economically strong struggle to obtain vaccines 138 On 14 November 2022 the first in hal able vaccine was introduced developed by Chinese bio pharmaceutical company Can Sino Biologics in the city of Shanghai China 139 For the first two years of the pandemic no specific and effective treatment or cure was available 140 141 In 2021 the European Medicines Agency's EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use CH MP approved the oral antiviral protease inhibitor Pax l ovid n irma tre lv ir plus the HIV antiviral rito navi r to treat adult patients 142 FDA later gave it an EU A 143 Most cases of C OVID 19 are mild In these supportive care includes medication such as paracetamol or NSAIDs to relieve symptoms fever 144 body aches cough adequate in take of oral fluids and rest 141 145 Good personal hygiene and a healthy diet are also recommended 146 Supportive care in severe cases includes treatment to relieve symptoms fluid therapy oxygen support and prone positioning and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs 147 More severe cases may need treatment in hospital In those with low oxygen levels use of the g luc oc or tico idd exam et has one is recommended to reduce mortality 148 Non invasive ventilation and ultimately admission to an intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing 149 Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation EC MO has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure 150 151 Existing drugs such as hydroxy chloroquine lop in avi r rito navi r and iver m ect in are not recommended by US or European health authorities as there is no good evidence they have any useful effect 140 152 153 The antiviral rem des iv iris available in the US Canada Australia and several other countries with varying restrictions however it is not recommended for use with mechanical ventilation and is discouraged altogether by the WHO 154 due to limited evidence of its efficacy 140 The severity of C OVID 19 varies It may take a mild course with few or no symptoms resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold In 3 4 of cases 7 4 for those over age 65 symptoms are severe enough to cause hospital is ation 155 Mild cases typically recover within two weeks while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover Among those who have died the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks Prolonged pro thro mb in time and elevated C reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of C OVID 19 and with a transfer to intensive care units ICU 156 157 Between 5 and 50 of C OVID 19 patients experience long C OVID 158 a condition characterised by long term consequences persisting after the typical convalescence period of the disease 159 160 The most commonly reported clinical presentations are fatigue and memory problems as well as malaise headaches shortness of breath loss of smell muscle weakness low fever and cognitive dysfunction 161 162 163 164 Many countries attempted to slow or stop the spread of C OVID 19 by recommending mandating or prohibiting behaviour changes while others relied primarily on providing information Measures ranged from public advisories to stringent lockdown s Outbreak control strategies are divided into elimination and mitigation Experts differentiate between elimination strategies known as zero C OVID that aim to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community 168 and mitigation strategies commonly known as flattening the curve that attempt to lessen the effects of the virus on society but which still tolerate some level of transmission within the community 169 These initial strategies can be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine induced immunity 170 Nature reported in 2021 that 90 of researchers who responded to a survey think that the coronavirus will become endemic 171 Containment is undertaken to stop an outbreak from spreading into the general population Infected individuals are isolated while they are infectious The people they have interacted with are contacted and isolated for long enough to ensure that they are either not infected or no longer contagious Screening is the starting point for containment Screening is done by checking for symptoms to identify infected individuals who can then be isolated or offered treatment 172 The zero C OVID strategy involves using public health measures such as contact tracing mass testing border quarantine lockdown s and mitigation software to stop community transmission of C OVID 19 as soon as it is detected with the goal of getting the area back to zero detected infections and resuming normal economic and social activities 168 173 Successful containment or suppression reduces Rt to less than 1 174 Should containment fail efforts focus on mitigation measures taken to slow the spread and limit its effects on the healthcare system and society Successful mitigation delays and decreases the epidemic peak known as flattening the epidemic curve 165 This decreases the risk of overwhelming health services and provides more time for developing vaccines and treatments 165 Individual behaviour changed in many jurisdictions Many people worked from home instead of at their traditional workplaces 175 Non pharmaceutical interventions that may reduce spread include personal actions such as wearing face masks self quarantine and hand hygiene community measures aimed at reducing interpersonal contacts such as closing workplaces and schools and cancelling large gatherings community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning 176 More drastic actions such as quarantining entire populations and strict travel bans have been attempted in various jurisdictions 177 The Chinese and Australian government approaches have included many lockdown s and are widely considered the most strict The New Zealand government response included the most severe travel restrictions As part of its K Quarantine programme South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals The Singaporean government's response included so called circuit breaker lockdown s and financial support for those affected while also imposing large fines for those who broke quarantine 178 Contact tracing attempts to identify recent contacts of newly infected individuals and to screen them for infection the traditional approach is to request a list of contacts from infect ees and then telephone or visit the contacts 179 Contact tracing was widely used during the Western African Ebola virus epidemic in 2014 180 Another approach is to collect location data from mobile devices to identify those who have come in significant contact with infect ees which prompted privacy concerns 181 On 10 April 2020 Google and Apple announced an initiative for privacy preserving contact tracing 182 183 In Europe and in the US Palant ir Technologies initially provided C OVID 19 tracking services 184 WHO described increasing capacity and adapting healthcare as a fundamental mitigation 185 The E CDC and WHO's European regional office issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting resources at multiple levels including focusing laboratory services towards testing cancelling elective procedures separating and isolating patients and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing ventilators and beds 185 186 The pandemic drove widespread adoption of tele health 187 Due to supply chain capacity limitations some manufacturers began 3 D printing material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts 188 189 In one example an Italian startup received legal threats due to alleged patent infringement after reverse engineering and printing one hundred requested ventilator valves overnight 190 Individuals and groups of makers created and shared open source designs and manufacturing devices using locally sourced materials sewing and 3 D printing Millions of face shields protective gowns and masks were made Other ad hoc medical supplies included shoe covers surgical caps powered air purifying respirators and hand san it is er Novel devices were created such as ear savers non invasive ventilation helmets and ventilator splitter s 191 In July 2021 several experts expressed concern that achieving herd immunity may not be possible because Delta can transmit among vaccinated individuals 192 CDC published data showing that vaccinated people could transmit Delta something officials believed was less likely with other variants Consequently WHO and CDC encouraged vaccinated people to continue with non pharmaceutical interventions such as masking social distancing and quarantining if exposed 193 The outbreak was discovered in Wuhan in November 2019 It is possible that human to human transmission was happening before the discovery 38 39 Based on a retrospective analysis starting from December 2019 the number of cases in Hubei gradually increased reaching 60 by 20 December and at least 266 by 31 December 194 A pneumonia cluster was observed on 26 December and treated by Chinese pul monolog is t Zhang Ji xian She informed the Wuhan Jiang han CDC on 27 December 195 After analysing pneumonia patient samples a genetic sequencing company named Vision Medicals reported the discovery of a novel coronavirus to the China CDC CCD C on 28 December 196 197 Two days later a test report from Capital Bio Med lab addressed to the Wuhan Central Hospital reported an erroneous positive result for SARS causing doctors there to alert authorities Eight of those doctors including ophthalmologist Li Wen liang 1985 2020 were detained by police on 3 January for spreading false rumours 198 That evening Wuhan Municipal Health Commission WM HC issued a notice about the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause 199 The next day WM HC made the announcement public confirming 27 cases 200 201 enough to trigger an investigation 202 On 31 December the WHO office in China was notified about the cluster of unknown pneumonia cases 21 200 and immediately launched an investigation 202 Official Chinese sources claimed that the early cases were mostly linked to the Huan an Seafood Wholesale Market which also sold live animals 203 In May 2020 CCD C director George Gao initially ruled out the market as a possible origin as animal samples collected there had tested negative 204 On 11 January WHO was notified by the Chinese National Health Commission that the outbreak was associated with exposures in the market and that China had identified a new type of coronavirus which it isolated on 7 January 21 Initially the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days 205 In early and mid January the virus spread to other Chinese provinces helped by the Chinese New Year migration Wuhan was a transport hub and major rail interchange 206 On 10 January the virus ' genome was shared publicly 207 A retrospective study published in March found that 6 174 people had reported symptoms by 20 January 208 A 24 January report indicated human transmission was likely occurring and recommended personal protective equipment for health workers It also advocated testing given the outbreak's pandemic potential 209 210 On 30 January 7 818 infections had been confirmed leading WHO to declare the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern PHE IC 211 212 213 upgrading it to a pandemic on 11 March 3 On 31 January the first published modelling study warned of inevitable independent self sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally and called for large scale public health interventions 214 By 31 January Italy indicated its first confirmed infections had occurred in two tourists from China 215 The WHO announced on 11 March its assessment that the situation could be characterised as a pandemic 3 On 19 March Italy overtook China as the country with the most reported deaths 216 By 26 March the United States had overtaken China and Italy as the country with the highest number of confirmed infections 217 Genomic analysis indicated that the majority of New York's confirmed infections came from Europe rather than directly from Asia 218 Testing of prior samples revealed a person who was infected in France on 27 December 2019 219 220 and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 February 221 In October WHO reported that one in ten people around the world may have been infected or 780 million people while only 35 million infections had been confirmed 222 On 9 November Pfizer released trial results for a candidate vaccine showing a 90 per cent effectiveness in preventing infection That day Nova vax submitted an FDA Fast Track application for their vaccine 223 224 On 14 December Public Health England reported that a variant had been discovered in the UK's southeast predominantly in Kent The variant later named Alpha showed changes to the spike protein that could make the virus more infectious As of 13 December 1 108 infections had been confirmed in the UK 225 226 On 4 February 2020 US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar waived liability for vaccine manufacturers in all cases except those involving willful misconduct 227 228 On 2 January the Alpha variant first discovered in the UK had been identified in 33 countries 229 On 6 January the Gamma variant was first identified in Japanese travellers returning from Brazil 230 On 29 January it was reported that the Nova vax vaccine was 49 per cent effective against the Beta variant in a clinical trial in South Africa 231 232 The Corona Vac vaccine was reported to be 50 4 per cent effective in a Brazil clinical trial 233 On 12 March several countries stopped using the Oxford Astra Zen eca C OVID 19 vaccine due to blood clotting problems specifically cerebral venous sinus thrombosis CV ST 234 On 20 March the WHO and European Medicines Agency found no link to thrombosis leading several countries to resume administering the vaccine 235 In March WHO reported that an animal host was the most likely origin without ruling out other possibilities 2 37 The Delta variant was first identified in India In mid April the variant was first detected in the UK and two months later it had become a full fledged third wave in the country forcing the government to delay reopening that was originally scheduled for June 236 On 10 November Germany advised against the Modern a vaccine for people under 30 due to a possible association with myo card it is 237 On 24 November the Omicron variant was detected in South Africa a few days later the WHO declared it a VoC variant of concern 238 The new variant is more infectious than the Delta variant 239 On 1 January Europe passed 100 million cases amidst a surge in the Omicron variant 240 Later that month the WHO recommended the rheumatoid arthritis drug Bari citi nib for severe or critical patients It also recommended the mono cl on al antibody So tro vi mab in patients with non severe disease but only those who are at highest risk of hospital is ation 241 On 24 January the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimated that about 57 of the world's population had been infected by C OVID 19 64 65 By 6 March it was reported that the total worldwide death count had surpassed 6 million people 242 By 6 July Omicron sub variants BA 4 and BA 5 had spread worldwide 243 WHO Director General Ted ros G he br eyes us stated on 14 September 2022 that The world has never been in a better position to end the pandemic citing the lowest number of weekly reported deaths since March 2020 He continued We are not there yet But the end is in sight we can see the finish line 244 245 246 247 On 21 October the United States surpassed 99 million cases of C OVID 19 the most cases of any country 248 By 30 October the worldwide daily death toll was 424 the lowest since 385 deaths were reported on 12 March 2020 249 17 November marked the three year anniversary since health officials in China first detected C OVID 19 250 On 11 November the WHO reported that deaths since the month of February had dropped 90 per cent Director General Ted ros said this was cause for optimism 251 On 3 December the WHO indicated that at least 90 of the world's population has some level of immunity to Sars CoV 2 252 In early December China began lifting some of its most stringent lockdown measures Subsequent data from China's health authorities revealed that 248 million people nearly 18 per cent of its population had been infected in the first 20 days of that month 253 On 29 December the US joined Italy Japan Taiwan and India in requiring negative C OVID 19 test results from all people travelling from China due to the new surge in cases The EU refused similar measures stating that the BF 7 omicron variant had already spread throughout Europe without becoming dominant 254 255 On 4 January 2023 the WHO said the information shared by China during the recent surge in infections lacked data such as hospital is ation rates 256 On 10 January the WHO's Europe office said the recent viral surge in China posed no immediate threat 257 On 16 January the WHO recommended that China monitor excess mortality to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of C OVID 19 258 On 30 January the three year anniversary of the original declaration the WHO determined that C OVID 19 still met the criteria for a public health emergency of international concern PHE IC 259 On 19 March WHO Director General Ted ros indicated he was confident the C OVID 19 pandemic would cease to be a public health emergency by the end of the year 260 On 5 May the WHO downgraded C OVID 19 from being a global health emergency though it continued to refer to it as a pandemic 261 The WHO does not make official declarations of when pandemics end 4 262 The decision came after Ted ros convened with the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee where in the Committee noted that due to the decrease in deaths and hospital is at ions and the prevalence of vaccinations and the level of general immunity it was time to remove the emergency designation and transition to long term management 263 Ted ros agreed and the WHO reduced the classification to an established and ongoing health issue 263 In a press conference Ted ros remarked that the diminishing threat from C OVID 19 had allowed most countries to return to life as we knew it before C OVID 19 264 In September the WHO said it had observed concerning trends in C OVID 19 case numbers and hospital is at ions although analysis was hampered because many countries were no longer recording C OVID 19 case statistics 265 In November 2023 in response to viral mutations and changing characteristics of infection the WHO adjusted its treatment guidelines Among other changes rem des iv ir and mol n up i ravi r were now recommended only for the most severe cases and deu remi devi rand iver m ect in were recommended against 266 National reactions ranged from strict lockdown s to public education campaigns 267 WHO recommended that curfews and lockdown s should be short term measures to reorganise regroup re balance resources and protect the health care system 268 As of 26 March 2020 1 7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown 269 This increased to 3 9 billion people by the first week of April more than half the world's population 270 271 In several countries protests rose against restrictions such as lockdown s A February 2021 study found that protests against restrictions were likely to directly increase the spread of the virus 272 As of the end of 2021 Asia's peak had come at the same time and at the same level as the world as a whole in May 2021 273 However cumulatively they had experienced only half of the global average in cases 274 China opted for containment instituting strict lockdown s to eliminate viral spread 275 276 The vaccines distributed in China included the BIB P WI BP and Corona Vac 277 It was reported on 11 December 2021 that China had vaccinated 1 162 billion of its citizens or 82 5 of the total population of the country against C OVID 19 278 China's large scale adoption of zero C OVID had largely contained the first waves of infections of the disease 275 279 280 When the waves of infections due to the Omicron variant followed China was almost alone in pursuing the strategy of zero C ovid to combat the spread of the virus in 2022 281 Lockdown continued to be employed in November to combat a new wave of cases 282 283 however protests erupted in cities across China over the country's stringent measures 284 285 and in December that year the country relaxed its zero C OVID policy 286 On 20 December 2022 the Chinese State Council narrowed its definition of what would be counted as a C OVID 19 death to include solely respiratory failure which led to scepticism by health experts of the government's total death count 287 288 at a time when hospitals reported being overwhelmed with cases following the abrupt discontinuation of zero C OVID 289 The first case in India was reported on 30 January 2020 India ordered a nationwide lockdown starting 24 March 2020 290 with a phased unlock beginning 1 June 2020 Six cities accounted for around half of reported cases Mumbai Delhi Ahmedabad Chennai Pune and Kolkata 291 Post lockdown the Government of India introduced a contact tracking app called A aro gya Set u to help authorities manage contact tracing and vaccine distribution 292 India's vaccination programme was considered to be the world's largest and most successful with over 90 of citizens getting the first dose and another 65 getting the second dose 293 294 A second wave hit India in April 2021 straining healthcare services 295 On 21 October 2021 it was reported that the country had surpassed 1 billion vaccinations 296 Iran reported its first confirmed cases on 19 February 2020 in Qom 298 299 Early measures included the cancellation closure of concerts and other cultural events 300 Friday prayers 301 and school and university campuses 302 Iran became a centre of the pandemic in February 2020 303 304 More than ten countries had traced their outbreaks to Iran by 28 February indicating a more severe outbreak than the 388 reported cases 304 305 The Iranian Parliament closed after 23 of its 290 members tested positive on 3 March 2020 306 At least twelve sitting or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died by 17 March 2020 307 By August 2021 the pandemic's fifth wave peaked with more than 400 deaths in 1 day 308 C OVID 19 was confirmed in South Korea on 20 January 2020 Military bases were quarantined after tests showed three infected soldiers 309 South Korea introduced what was then considered the world's largest and best organised screening programme isolating infected people and tracing and quarantining contacts 310 Screening methods included mandatory self reporting by new international arrivals through mobile application 311 combined with drive through testing 312 and increasing testing capability to 20 000 people day 313 Despite some early criticisms 314 South Korea's programme was considered a success in controlling the outbreak without quarantining entire cities 310 315 316 The C OVID 19 pandemic arrived in Europe with its first confirmed case in Bordeaux France on 24 January 2020 and subsequently spread widely across the continent By 17 March 2020 every country in Europe had confirmed a case 317 and all had reported at least one death with the exception of Vatican City Italy was the first European nation to experience a major outbreak in early 2020 becoming the first country worldwide to introduce a national lockdown 318 By 13 March 2020 the WHO declared Europe the epicentre of the pandemic 319 320 and it remained so until the WHO announced it had been overtaken by South America on 22 May 321 By 18 March 2020 more than 250 million people were in lockdown in Europe 322 Despite deployment of C OVID 19 vaccines Europe became the pandemic's epicentre once again in late 2021 323 324 The Italian outbreak began on 31 January 2020 when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS CoV 2 in Rome 215 Cases began to rise sharply which prompted the government to suspend flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency 325 On 22 February 2020 the Council of Ministers announced a new decree law to contain the outbreak which quarantined more than 50 000 people in northern Italy 326 On 4 March the Italian government ordered schools and universities closed as Italy reached a hundred deaths Sport was suspended completely for at least one month 327 On 11 March Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte closed down nearly all commercial activity except supermarkets and pharmacies 328 329 On 19 April the first wave ebbed as 7 day deaths declined to 433 330 On 13 October the Italian government again issued restrictive rules to contain the second wave 331 On 10 November Italy surpassed 1 million confirmed infections 332 On 23 November it was reported that the second wave of the virus had led some hospitals to stop accepting patients 333 The virus was first confirmed to have spread to Spain on 31 January 2020 when a German tourist tested positive for SARS CoV 2 on La Gomera in the Canary Islands 334 Post hoc genetic analysis has shown that at least 15 strains of the virus had been imported and community transmission began by mid February 335 On 29 March it was announced that beginning the following day all non essential workers were ordered to remain at home for the next 14 days 336 The number of cases increased again in July in a number of cities including Barcelona Zaragoza and Madrid which led to re imposition of some restrictions but no national lockdown 337 338 339 340 By September 2021 Spain was one of the countries with the highest percentage of its population vaccinated 76 fully vaccinated and 79 with the first dose 341 Italy is ranked second at 75 341 Sweden differed from most other European countries in that it mostly remained open 342 Per the Swedish constitution the Public Health Agency of Sweden has autonomy that prevents political interference and the agency favoured remaining open The Swedish strategy focused on longer term measures based on the assumption that after lockdown the virus would resume spreading with the same result 343 344 By the end of June Sweden no longer had excess mortality 345 Devolution in the United Kingdom meant that each of its four countries developed its own response England's restrictions were shorter lived than the others 346 The UK government started enforcing social distancing and quarantine measures on 18 March 2020 347 348 On 16 March Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised against non essential travel and social contact praising work from home and avoiding venues such as pubs restaurants and theatres 349 350 On 20 March the government ordered all leisure establishments to close 351 and promised to prevent unemployment 352 On 23 March Johnson banned gatherings and restricted non essential travel and outdoor activity Unlike previous measures these restrictions were enforceable by police through fines and dispersal of gatherings Most non essential businesses were ordered to close 353 On 24 April 2020 it was reported that a promising vaccine trial had begun in England the government pledged more than 50 million towards research 354 On 16 April 2020 it was reported that the UK would have first access to the Oxford vaccine due to a prior contract should the trial be successful some 30 million doses would be available 355 On 2 December 2020 the UK became the first developed country to approve the Pfizer vaccine 800 000 doses were immediately available for use 356 In August 2022 it was reported that viral infection cases had declined in the UK 357 The virus arrived in the United States on 13 January 2020 358 Cases were reported in all North American countries after Saint Kitts and Nevis confirmed a case on 25 March and in all North American territories after Bonaire confirmed a case on 16 April 359 Per Our World in Data 103 436 829 5 confirmed cases have been reported in the United States with 1 228 289 5 deaths the most of any country and the nineteenth highest per capita worldwide 360 C OVID 19 is the deadliest pandemic in US history 361 it was the third leading cause of death in the US in 2020 behind heart disease and cancer 362 From 2019 to 2020 US life expectancy dropped by 3 years for Hispanic Americans 2 9 years for African Americans and 1 2 years for white Americans 363 These effects have persisted as US deaths due to C OVID 19 in 2021 exceeded those in 2020 364 In the United States C OVID 19 vaccines became available under emergency use in December 2020 beginning the national vaccination programme The first C OVID 19 vaccine was officially approved by the Food and Drug Administration on 23 August 2021 365 By 18 November 2022 while cases in the U S had declined C OVID variants BQ 1 BQ 1 1 had become dominant in the country 366 367 In March 2020 as cases of community transmission were confirmed across Canada all of its provinces and territories declared states of emergency Provinces and territories to varying degrees implemented school and daycare closures prohibitions on gatherings closures of non essential businesses and restrictions on entry Canada severely restricted its border access barring travellers from all countries with some exceptions 368 Cases surged across Canada notably in the provinces of British Columbia Alberta Quebec and Ontario with the formation of the Atlantic Bubble a travel restricted area of the country formed of the four Atlantic provinces 369 Vaccine passports were adopted in all provinces and two of the territories 370 371 Per a report on 11 November 2022 Canadian health authorities saw a surge in influenza while C OVID 19 was expected to rise during winter 372 The C OVID 19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached South America on 26 February 2020 when Brazil confirmed a case in S o Paulo 373 By 3 April all countries and territories in South America had recorded at least one case 374 On 13 May 2020 it was reported that Latin America and the Caribbean had reported over 400 000 cases of C OVID 19 infection with 23 091 deaths On 22 May 2020 citing the rapid increase of infections in Brazil the WHO declared South America the epicentre of the pandemic 375 376 As of 16 July 2021 South America had recorded 34 359 631 confirmed cases and 1 047 229 deaths from C OVID 19 Due to a shortage of testing and medical facilities it is believed that the outbreak is far larger than the official numbers show 377 The virus was confirmed to have spread to Brazil on 25 February 2020 378 when a man from S o Paulo who had travelled to Italy tested positive for the virus 379 The disease had spread to every federative unit of Brazil by 21 March On 19 June 2020 the country reported its one millionth case and nearly 49 000 reported deaths 380 381 One estimate of under reporting was 22 62 of total reported C OVID 19 mortality in 2020 382 383 384 As of 05 December 2025 Brazil with 37 903 843 5 confirmed cases and 703 536 5 deaths has the third highest number of confirmed cases and second highest death toll from C OVID 19 in the world behind only those of the United States and India 385 The C OVID 19 pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Africa on 14 February 2020 with the first confirmed case announced in Egypt 386 387 The first confirmed case in sub Saharan Africa was announced in Nigeria at the end of February 2020 388 Within three months the virus had spread throughout the continent Lesotho the last African sovereign state to have remained free of the virus reported its first case on 13 May 2020 389 390 By 26 May it appeared that most African countries were experiencing community transmission although testing capacity was limited 391 Most of the identified imported cases arrived from Europe and the United States rather than from China where the virus originated 392 Many preventive measures were implemented by different countries in Africa including travel restrictions flight cancellations and event cancellations 393 Despite fears Africa reported lower death rates than other more economically developed regions 394 In early June 2021 Africa faced a third wave of C OVID infections with cases rising in 14 countries 395 By 4 July the continent recorded more than 251 000 new C OVID cases a 20 increase from the prior week and a 12 increase from the January peak More than sixteen African countries including Malawi and Senegal recorded an up tick in new cases 396 The WHO labelled it Africa's ' Worst Pandemic Week Ever ' 397 In October 2022 WHO reported that most countries on the African continent will miss the goal of 70 per cent vaccination by the end of 2022 398 The C OVID 19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Oceania on 25 January 2020 with the first confirmed case reported in Melbourne Australia 399 400 It has since spread elsewhere in the region 401 400 Australia and New Zealand were praised for their handling of the pandemic in comparison to other Western nations with New Zealand and each state in Australia wiping out all community transmission of the virus several times even after re introduction into the community 402 403 404 As a result of the high trans miss i bil it y of the Delta variant however by August 2021 the Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria had conceded defeat in their eradication efforts 405 In early October 2021 New Zealand also abandoned its elimination strategy 406 In November and December following vaccination efforts the remaining states of Australia excluding Western Australia voluntarily gave upC OVID Zero to open up state and international borders 407 408 409 The open borders allowed the Omicron variant of C OVID 19 to enter quickly and cases subsequently exceeded 120 000 a day 410 By early March 2022 with cases exceeding 1 000 a day Western Australia conceded defeat in its eradication strategy and opened its borders 411 Despite record cases Australian jurisdictions slowly removed restrictions such as close contact isolation mask wearing and density limits by April 2022 412 On 9 September 2022 restrictions were significantly relaxed The aircraft mask mandate was scrapped nationwide and daily reporting transitioned to weekly reporting 413 414 415 On 14 September C OVID 19 disaster payment for isolating persons was extended for mandatory isolation 416 By 22 September all states had ended mask mandates on public transport including in Victoria where the mandate had lasted for approximately 800 days 417 On 30 September 2022 all Australian leaders declared the emergency response finished and announced the end of isolation requirements These changes were due in part to high levels of ' hybrid immunity ' and low case numbers 418 Due to its remoteness and sparse population Antarctica was the last continent to have confirmed cases of C OVID 19 419 420 421 The first cases were reported in December 2020 almost a year after the first cases of C OVID 19 were detected in China At least 36 people were infected in the first outbreak in 2020 422 with several other outbreaks taking place in 2021 and 2022 423 The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNSC was criticised for its slow response especially regarding the UN's global ceasefire which aimed to open up humanitarian access to conflict zones 424 425 The United Nations Security Council was criticised due to the inadequate manner in which it dealt with the C OVID 19 pandemic namely the poor ability to create international collaboration during this crisis 426 427 On 23 March 2020 United Nations Secretary General Ant nio Manuel de Oliveira Gu terre s appealed for a global ceasefire 428 429 172 UN member states and observers signed a non binding supporting statement in June 430 and the UN Security Council passed a resolution supporting it in July 431 432 On 29 September 2020 Gu terre s urged the International Monetary Fund to help certain countries via debt relief and also call for countries to increase contributions to develop vaccines 433 The WHO spearheaded initiatives such as the C OVID 19 Solidarity Response Fund to raise money for the pandemic response the UN C OVID 19 Supply Chain Task Force and the solidarity trial for investigating potential treatment options for the disease The CO VAX programme co led by the WHO GA VI and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations C EPI aimed to accelerate the development manufacture and distribution of C OVID 19 vaccines and to guarantee fair and equitable access across the world 434 435 The pandemic shook the world's economy with especially severe economic damage in the United States Europe and Latin America 436 437 A consensus report by American intelligence agencies in April 2021 concluded Efforts to contain and manage the virus have reinforced nationalist trends globally as some states turned inward to protect their citizens and sometimes cast blame on marginal is ed groups C OVID 19 inflamed partisanship and polarisation around the world as bitter arguments exploded over how to respond International trade was disrupted amid the formation of no entry enclaves 438 The pandemic led many countries and regions to impose quarantines entry bans or other restrictions either for citizens recent travellers to affected areas 439 or for all travellers 440 441 Travel collapsed worldwide damaging the travel sector The effectiveness of travel restrictions was questioned as the virus spread across the world 442 One study found that travel restrictions only modestly affected the initial spread unless combined with other infection prevention and control measures 443 444 Researchers concluded that travel restrictions are most useful in the early and late phase of an epidemic and restrictions of travel from Wuhan unfortunately came too late 445 The European Union rejected the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel zone 446 447 Several countries repatriated their citizens and diplomatic staff from Wuhan and surrounding areas primarily through charter flights Canada the United States Japan India Sri Lanka Australia France Argentina Germany and Thailand were among the first to do so 448 Brazil and New Zealand evacuated their own nationals and others 449 450 On 14 March South Africa repatriated 112 South Africans who tested negative while four who showed symptoms were left behind 451 Pakistan declined to evacuate its citizens 452 On 15 February the US announced it would evacuate Americans aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship 453 and on 21 February Canada evacuated 129 Canadians from the ship 454 In early March the Indian government began repatriating its citizens from Iran 455 456 On 20 March the United States began to withdraw some troops from Iraq 457 The pandemic and responses to it damaged the global economy On 27 February 2020 worries about the outbreak crushed US stock indexes which posted their sharpest falls since 2008 458 Tourism collapsed due to travel restrictions closing of public places including travel attractions and advice of governments against travel Airlines cancelled flights while British regional airline Fly be collapsed 459 The cruise line industry was hard hit 460 and train stations and ferry ports closed 461 International mail stopped or was delayed 462 The retail sector faced reductions in store hours or closures 463 Retailers in Europe and Latin America faced traffic declines of 40 per cent North America and Middle East retailers saw a 50 60 per cent drop 464 Shopping centres faced a 33 43 per cent drop in foot traffic in March compared to February Mall operators around the world coped by increasing sanitation installing thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers and cancelling events 465 Hundreds of millions of jobs were lost 466 467 including more than 40 million jobs in the US 468 According to a report by Yelp about 60 of US businesses that closed will stay shut permanently 469 The International Labour Organization ILO reported that the income generated in the first nine months of 2020 from work across the world dropped by 10 7 or 3 5 trillion 470 Pandemic fears led to panic buying emptying groceries of essentials such as food toilet paper and bottled water Panic buying stemmed from perceived threat perceived scarcity fear of the unknown coping behaviour and social psychological factors e g social influence and trust 471 Supply shortages were due to disruption to factory and logistic operations shortages were worsened by supply chain disruptions from factory and port shutdowns and labour shortages 472 Shortages continued as managers underestimated the speed of economic recovery after the initial economic crash The technology industry in particular warned of delays from underestimates of semiconductor demand for vehicles and other products 473 According to WHO Secretary General Ted ros G he br eyes us demand for personal protective equipment PPE rose one hundredfold pushing prices up twenty fold 474 475 PPE stocks were exhausted everywhere 476 477 478 In September 2021 the World Bank reported that food prices remained generally stable and the supply outlook remained positive However the poorest countries witnessed a sharp increase in food prices reaching the highest level since the pandemic began 479 480 The Agricultural Commodity Price Index stabilised in the third quarter but remained 17 higher than in January 2021 481 480 By contrast petroleum products were in surplus at the beginning of the pandemic as demand for gasoline and other products collapsed due to reduced commuting and other trips 482 The 2021 global energy crisis was driven by a global surge in demand as the world economy recovered Energy demand was particularly strong in Asia 483 484 The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were profoundly affected by the pandemic Both organisations ' and individuals ' operations have been impacted globally By March 2020 across the world and to varying degrees museums libraries performance venues and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions events and performances cancelled or postponed 485 A 2021 UNESCO report estimated ten million job losses worldwide in the culture and creative industries 486 487 Some services continued through digital platforms 488 489 490 such as live streaming concerts 491 or web based arts festivals 492 The pandemic affected political systems causing suspensions of legislative activities 493 isolation s or deaths of politicians 494 and rescheduled elections 495 Although they developed broad support among epidemiologists NP Is non pharmaceutical interventions were controversial in many countries Intellectual opposition came primarily from other fields along with heterodox epidemiologists 496 The pandemic and the response of Brazilian politicians to it led to widespread panic confusion and pessimism in Brazil 497 When questioned regarding record deaths in the country in April 2020 Brazilian president Jair Bol sonar o said So what I'm sorry What do you want me to do about it 498 Bol sonar o disregarded WHO recommended mitigation techniques and instead downplayed the risks of the virus promoted increased economic activity spread misinformation about the efficacy of masks vaccines and public health measures and distributed unproven treatments including hydroxy chloroquine and iver m ect in 497 A series of federal health ministers resigned or were dismissed after they refused to implement Bol sonar o's policies 499 Disagreements between federal and state governments led to a chaotic and delayed response to the rapid spread of the virus 500 exacerbated by preexisting social and economic disparities in the country 497 501 Employment investment and valuation of the Brazilian real plummeted to record lows 497 502 Brazil was also heavily affected by the Delta and Omicron variants 503 At the height of the outbreak in the spring of 2021 3 000 Brazilians were dying per day 504 505 Bol sonar o's loss to Lula da Silva in the 2022 presidential election is widely credited to the former's mishandling of the pandemic 506 507 508 Multiple provincial level administrators of the Chinese Communist Party CCP were dismissed over their handling of quarantine measures Some commentators claimed this move was intended to protect CCP General Secretary Xi J in ping 509 The US intelligence community claimed that China intentionally under reported its C OVID 19 caseload 510 The Chinese government maintained that it acted swiftly and transparently 511 512 Journalists and activists in China who reported on the pandemic were detained by authorities 513 514 including Zhang Zh an who was arrested and tortured 515 516 In early March 2020 the Italian government criticised the EU's lack of solidarity with Italy 517 518 519 On 22 March 2020 after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte Russian president Vladimir Put in ordered the Russian army to send military medics disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy 520 521 In early April Norway and EU states like Romania and Austria started to offer help by sending medical personnel and disinfectant 522 and European Commission president Ursula von der Le yen offered an official apology to the country 523 Beginning in mid April 2020 protestors objected to government imposed business closures and restrictions on personal movement and assembly 525 Simultaneously essential workers protested unsafe conditions and low wages by participating in a brief general strike 526 Some political analysts claimed that the pandemic contributed to US president Donald Trump's 2020 defeat 527 528 The C OVID 19 pandemic in the United States prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries including universal health care universal child care paid sick leave and higher levels of funding for public health 529 530 531 The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that preventable hospital is at ions of un vaccinated Americans in the second half of 2021 cost US 13 8 billion 532 There were also protest in regards to vaccine mandates in the United States 533 In January 2022 the US Supreme Court struck down an OSHA rule that mandated vaccination or a testing regimen for all companies with greater than 100 employees 534 535 The number of journalists imprisoned or detained increased worldwide some detentions were related to the pandemic 536 537 The planned NATO Defender 2020 military exercise in Germany Poland and the Baltic states the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War was held on a reduced scale 538 539 The Iranian government was heavily affected by the virus which infected some two dozen parliament members and political figures 305 540 Iranian president Hassan Rou hani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020 due to a lack of access to international markets 541 Saudi Arabia which had launched a military intervention in Yemen in March 2015 declared a ceasefire 542 Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened 543 South Korea criticised Japan's ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts after Japan announced travellers from South Korea must quarantine for two weeks 544 South Korean society was initially polarised on president Moon Jae in's response to the crisis many Koreans signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment or praising his response 314 Some countries passed emergency legislation Some commentators expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power 545 546 In Hungary the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orb n to rule by decree indefinitely suspend parliament and elections and punish those deemed to have spread false information 547 In countries such as Egypt 548 Turkey 549 and Thailand 550 opposition activists and government critics were arrested for allegedly spreading fake news 551 In India journalists criticising the government's response were arrested or issued warnings by police and authorities 552 The pandemic disrupted food systems worldwide 553 554 hitting at a time when hunger and under nourishment were rising an estimated 690 million people lacked food security in 2019 555 Food access fell driven by falling in comes lost remittances and disruptions to food production 556 In some cases food prices rose 553 555 The pandemic and its accompanying lockdown s and travel restrictions slowed movement of food aid According to the WHO 811 million people were undernourished in 2020 likely related to the fallout of C OVID 19 557 437 The pandemic impacted educational systems in many countries Many governments temporarily closed educational institutions often replaced by online education Other countries such as Sweden kept their schools open As of September 2020 approximately 1 077 billion learners were affected due to school closures School closures impacted students teachers and families with far reaching economic and societal consequences 558 They shed light on social and economic issues including student debt digital learning food in security and homelessness as well as access to childcare health care housing internet and disability services The impact was more severe for disadvantaged children 559 Many countries including Bangladesh granted auto promotion to the public examination candidates 560 The Higher Education Policy Institute reported that around 63 of students claimed worsened mental health as a result of the pandemic 561 The pandemic impacted global health for many conditions Hospital visits fell 562 Visits for heart attack symptoms declined by 38 in the US and 40 in Spain 563 The head of cardiology at the University of Arizona said My worry is some of these people are dying at home because they're too scared to go to the hospital 564 People with strokes and appendicitis were less likely to seek treatment 565 566 564 Medical supply shortages impacted many people 567 The pandemic impacted mental health 568 569 increasing anxiety depression and post traumatic stress disorder affecting healthcare workers patients and quarantined individuals 570 571 In late 2022 during the first northern hemisphere autumn and winter seasons following the widespread relaxation of global public health measures North America and Europe experienced a surge in respiratory viruses and co infections in both adults and children 572 This formed the beginning of the 2022 2023 pae di at ric care crisis and what some experts termed a triple demi c of seasonal influenza respiratory syncytial virus RSV and SARS CoV 2 throughout North America 573 574 In the United Kingdom pae di at ric infections also began to spike beyond pre pandemic levels albeit with different illnesses such as Group A streptococcal infection and resultant scarlet fever 575 576 As of mid December 2022 19 children in the UK had died due to Strep A and the wave of infections had begun to spread into North America and Mainland Europe 577 578 The B Yamagata lineage of influenza B might have become extinct in 2020 2021 due to C OVID 19 pandemic measures 579 580 There have been no naturally occurring cases confirmed since March 2020 581 582 In 2023 the WHO concluded that protection against the Yamagata lineage was no longer necessary in the seasonal flu vaccine reducing the number of lineages targeted by the vaccine from four to three 581 582 The pandemic and the reaction to it positively affected the environment and climate as a result of reduced human activity During the an thro pause fossil fuel use decreased resource consumption declined and waste disposal improved generating less pollution 584 Planned air travel and vehicle transportation declined In China lockdown s and other measures resulted in a 26 decrease in coal consumption and a 50 reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions 584 585 586 In 2020 a worldwide study on mammalian wildlife responses to human presence during C OVID lockdown s found complex patterns of animal behaviour Carnivores were generally less active when humans were around while herbivores in developed areas were more active Among other findings this suggested that herbivores may view humans as a shield against predators highlighting the importance of location and human presence history in understanding wildlife responses to changes in human activity in a given area 587 A wide variety of largely mammalian species both captive and wild have been shown to be susceptible to SARS CoV 2 with some encountering a particularly high degree of fatal outcomes 588 In particular both farmed and wild mink have developed highly symptomatic and severe C OVID 19 infections with a mortality rate as high as 35 55 according to one study 589 590 White tailed deer on the other hand have largely avoided severe outcomes but have effectively become natural reservoirs of the virus with large numbers of free ranging deer infected throughout the US and Canada including approximately 80 of Iowa's wild deer herd 591 592 An August 2023 study appeared to confirm the status of white tailed deer as a disease reservoir noting that the viral evolution of SARS CoV 2 in deer occurs at triple the rate of its evolution in humans and that infection rates remained high even in areas rarely frequented by humans 593 Heightened prejudice xenophobia and racism toward people of Chinese and East Asian descent were documented around the world 595 596 Reports from February 2020 when most confirmed cases were confined to China cited racist sentiments about Chinese people ' deserving ' the virus 597 598 599 Individuals of Asian descent in Europe and North America reported increasing instances of racially motivated abuse and assaults as a result of the pandemic 600 601 602 US president Donald Trump was criticised for referring to SARS CoV 2 as the Chinese Virus and Kung Flu terms which were condemned as being racist and xenophobic 603 604 605 Age based discrimination against older adults increased during the pandemic This was attributed to their perceived vulnerability and subsequent physical and social isolation measures which coupled with their reduced social activity increased dependency on others Similarly limited digital literacy left the elderly more vulnerable to isolation depression and loneliness 606 In a correspondence published in The Lancet in 2021 German epi de mio logi st G nter Kampf described the harmful effects of inappropriate stigma tis ation of un vaccinated people who include our patients colleagues and other fellow citizens noting the evidence that vaccinated individuals play a large role in transmission 607 American bio ethic is t Arthur Ca plan responded to Kampf writing Criticising the un vaccinated who wind up in hospitals and morgues in huge numbers put stress on finite resources and prolong the pandemic is not stigma ti sing it is deserved moral condemnation 608 In January 2022 Amnesty International urged Italy to change their anti C OVID 19 restrictions to avoid discrimination against un vaccinated people saying that the government must continue to ensure that the entire population can enjoy its fundamental rights The restrictions included mandatory vaccination over the age of 50 and mandatory vaccination to use public transport 609 The pandemic triggered massive changes in behaviour from increased Internet commerce to cultural changes in the workplace Online retailers in the US posted 791 70 billion in sales in 2020 an increase of 32 4 from 598 02 billion the year before 610 Home delivery orders increased while indoor restaurant dining shut down due to lockdown orders or low sales 611 612 Hackers cyber criminals and scam mers took advantage of the changes to launch new online attacks 613 Education in some countries temporarily shifted from physical attendance to video conferencing 614 Massive layoffs shrank the airline travel hospitality and other industries 615 616 Despite most corporations implementing measures to address C OVID 19 in the workplace a poll from Catalyst found that as many as 68 of employees around the world felt that these policies were only per formative and not genuine 617 The pandemic led to a surge in remote work According to a Gallup poll only 4 of US employees were fully remote before the pandemic compared to 43 in May 2020 Among white collar workers that shift was more pronounced with 6 increasing to 65 in the same period 618 That trend continued in later stages of the pandemic with many workers choosing to remain remote even after workplaces reopened 619 620 Many Nordic European and Asian companies increased their recruitment of international remote workers even as the pandemic waned partially to save on labour costs 621 622 This also led to a talent drain in the global south and in remote areas in the global north 622 623 High cost of living and dense urban areas also lost office real estate value due to remote worker exodus 624 By May 2023 due to increasing layoffs and concerns over productivity some white collar workplaces in the US had resorted to performance review penalties and indirect incentives e g donations to charity to encourage workers to return to the office 625 A 2021 study noted that the C OVID 19 pandemic had increased interest in epidemics and infectious diseases among both historians and the general public Prior to the pandemic these topics were usually overlooked by general history and only received attention in the history of medicine 626 Many comparisons were made between the C OVID 19 and 1918 influenza pandemics 627 628 including the development of anti mask movements 629 630 the widespread promotion of misinformation 631 632 and the impact of socioeconomic disparities 633 In some areas religious groups exacerbated the spread of the virus through large gatherings and the dissemination of misinformation 634 635 636 Some religious leaders decried what they saw as violations of religious freedom 637 In other cases religious identity was a beneficial factor for health increasing compliance with public health measures and protecting against the negative effects of isolation on mental wellbeing 638 639 640 Some news organisations removed their online pay walls for some or all of their pandemic related articles and posts 641 Many scientific publishers provided pandemic related journal articles to the public free of charge as part of the National Institutes of Health's C OVID 19 Public Health Emergency Initiative 642 643 According to one estimate from researchers at the University of Rome 89 5 of C OVID 19 related papers were open access compared to an average of 48 8 for the ten most deadly human diseases 644 The share of papers published on pre print servers prior to peer review increased dramatically 645 During the pandemic Web G IS technology was leveraged to provide up to date visualisation s of data related to the pandemic with the public 646 Employing this technology the Johns Hopkins University C OVID 19 dashboard served as the first global visualisation of C OVID 19 data which established it as the default method for government agencies to disse men i ate relevant spatial information 647 648 These dashboards were described by Jonathan Evert s as the most striking cultural artefact of the current coronavirus SARS CoV 2 pandemic 647 and during the pandemic every state government in the United States maintained one 649 Misinformation and conspiracy theories about the pandemic have been widespread they travel through mass media social media and text messaging 650 In March 2020 WHO declared an info demi c of incorrect information 651 Cognitive biases such as confirmation bias are linked to conspiracy beliefs including C OVID 19 vaccine hesitancy 652 The C OVID 19 pandemic had a major impact on popular culture It was included in the narratives of ongoing pre pandemic television series and become a central narrative in new ones with mixed results 653 Writing for The New York Times about the then upcoming BBC sitcom Pandemonium on 16 December 2020 David Segal asked Are we ready to laugh about C ovid 19 Or rather is there anything amusing or recognizable in a humorous way about life during a plague with all of its indignities and setbacks not to mention its rituals and rules 654 The pandemic had driven some people to seek peaceful escapism in media while others were drawn towards fictional pandemics e g zombie apocalypses as an alternate form of escapism 655 Common themes have included contagion isolation and loss of control 656 Many drew comparisons to the fictional film Contagion 2011 657 658 praising its ac curacies while noting some differences 659 such as the lack of an orderly vaccine rollout 660 661 As people turned to music to relieve emotions evoked by the pandemic Spot if y listener ship showed that classical ambient and children's genres grew while pop country and dance remained relatively stable 662 A March 2022 review declared a transition to endemic status to be inevitable 663 In June 2022 an article in Human Genomics said that the pandemic was still raging but that now is the time to explore the transition from the pandemic to the endemic phase 664 Another review that month predicted that the virus that causes C OVID 19 would become the fifth endemic seasonal coronavirus alongside four other human coronavirus es 665 A February 2023 review of the four common cold coronavirus es concluded that the virus would become seasonal and like the common cold cause less severe disease for most people 666 Another 2023 review stated that the transition to endemic C OVID 19 may take years or decades 667 On 5 May 2023 the WHO declared that the pandemic was no longer a public health emergency of international concern 668 This led several media outlets to incorrectly report that this meant the pandemic was over The WHO commented to Full Fact that it was unlikely to declare the pandemic over in the near future and mentioned cholera which it considers to have been a pandemic since 1961 i e continuously for the last 64 years 669 The WHO does not have an official category for pandemics or make declarations of when pandemics start or end 4 262 670 13 In June 2023 Hans Kluge director of the WHO in Europe commented that While the international public health emergency may have ended the pandemic certainly has not The WHO in Europe launched a transition plan to manage the public health response to C OVID 19 in the coming years and prepare for possible future emergencies 671 Epidemics and pandemics usually end when the disease becomes endemic and when the disease becomes an accepted manageable part of normal life in a given society 15 As of March 2024 there was no widely agreed definition of when a disease is or is not a pandemic though efforts at a formal definition were underway Experts asked by Time that month noted that C OVID 19 continued to circulate and cause disease but expressed uncertainty as to whether it should still be described as a pandemic 13 Despite strong economic rebounds following the initial lockdown s in early 2020 towards the latter phases of the pandemic many countries began to experience long term economic effects Several countries saw high inflation rates which had global impacts particularly in developing countries 672 Some economic impacts such as supply chain and trade operations were seen as more permanent as the pandemic exposed major weaknesses in these systems 673 In Australia the pandemic caused an increase in occupational burnout in 2022 674 During the pandemic a large percentage of workers in Canada came to prefer working from home which had an impact on the traditional work model Some corporations made efforts to force workers to return to work on site while some embraced the idea 675 There was a travel boom causing air travel to recover at rates faster than anticipated and the aviation industry became profitable in 2023 for the first time since 2019 before the pandemic 676 However economic issues meant some predicted that the boom would begin to slow down 677 Business travel on airlines was still below pre pandemic levels and is predicted not to recover 678 An increase in excess deaths from underlying causes not related to C OVID 19 has been largely blamed on systematic issues causing delays in health care and screening during the pandemic which has resulted in an increase of non C OVID 19 related deaths 679 During the pandemic millions of children missed out on vaccinations as countries focused efforts on combating C OVID 19 Efforts were made to increase vaccination rates among children in low income countries These efforts were successful in increasing vaccination rates for some diseases though the UN noted that post pandemic measles vaccinations were still falling behind 680 Some of the decrease in im munis ation was driven by an increase in mistrust of public health officials This was seen in both low income and high income countries Several African countries saw a decline in vaccinations due to misinformation around the pandemic flowing into other areas 681 Im munis ation rates have yet to recover in the United States 682 and the United Kingdom 683",
