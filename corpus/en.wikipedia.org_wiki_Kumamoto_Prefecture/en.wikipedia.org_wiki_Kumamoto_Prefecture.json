The current Japanese orthography for Kumamoto literally means \"bear root/origin,\" or \"origin of the bear.\" However, Man'yōgana -like phonetic transcriptions based on the kanji for \"a ball, a sphere\" (球 /ku/ ~ /kjū/) and \"to polish, to grind, to brush (one's teeth)\" (磨 /ma/) are used for the names of the Kuma River (球磨川) and Kuma District (球磨郡).

[ 8 ]\n\nThe prefecture has a mascot named \" Kumamon \", a black bear with red cheeks, who was created to attract tourists to the region after the Kyushu Shinkansen line opened.
