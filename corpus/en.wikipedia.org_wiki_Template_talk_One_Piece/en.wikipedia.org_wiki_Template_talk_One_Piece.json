    "transformers_text": "Ahem Yes I know their a we ful Lol But that can be changed after Its been completed right Angel Em fr bl 12 07 23 July 2006 UTC reply For the color scheme perhaps making the top bar yellow with the other bars being sky blue The One Piece on the top bar will be dark blue while the words on the other bars are orange I don't know the codes for the colors so can anyone else do this Sigma sonic X 22 01 24 July 2006 UTC reply General Cut ty fl am 10 05 25 July 2006 UTC reply I edited the template yesterday with some minor changes Angel Em fr bl reverted it Since I really don't want to start an edit war I've put it up for discussion got Whiskey Peak Little Garden etc etc Like the original list on the old main page A Main Character to Straw Hat Pirates Duh they're the main characters B Editing Lucci and Span dam out the entire CP 9 in C Villi an s to Enemies Buggy and Wa pol can hardly be called evil Neither does Ged a tsu and some others but that's D D Re entering B W CP 9 and Sky pie a's Priests in the Enemies part Crocodile is merely the enemy in Araba st a you've still got Little Garden and Whiskey Peak both in which B W were the enemy just not C roc Like the original list where you had Baroque Works Sir Crocodile Skype i a's Priests En eru and just the CP 9 near the end of the list Objections If we include every enemy it'll get quite crowded Only the main villains should be included just like how the Character List used to be If you mean just putting for example Cipher Pol under the Villains section then that would be pointless because they are already under Other Factions Sigma sonic X 01 25 27 July 2006 UTC reply I'm not suggesting removal of the section just slight modification Hardly noticeable Kuri giri 21 26 27 July 2006 UTC reply Personally I think we should just have the leaders of the organizations in the Enemies section After all if we include Baroque Works along with Sir Crocodile there why shouldn't we include Bellamy Pirates along with Bellamy and so on I feel it would make the template too top heavy so I think it would be best for the leader and the organization to be kept seperate Or alternatively we could simply for go the leaders ' articles and place the crews in the Enemy section though this would make the Pirate Crew section practically useless Sigma sonic X 15 57 30 July 2006 UTC reply The edits I made to the Enemies section was only in order for it to match the original list from the past version of the main One Piece article Still because during the B W saga c roc is only the enemy in arabs ta and you've still got two islands without no enemy Very not OP like Kuri giri 20 35 30 July 2006 UTC reply I have a suggestion for the factions section Why not have it Or is this suggesting too much Angel Em fr bl 09 01 27 July 2006 UTC reply Well I set up the basics of this page today so added it back in can't say I'm proud of my effort Because I didn't know how to approach it Hmm Everyone agree with it on whether its okay to replace that It was removed previously Angel Em fr bl 10 52 27 July 2006 UTC reply A ck I'm trying to save a dozen pages related to One Piece now because someone stepped in One of the changes he has noted is the size of the template compared to some of the pages I don't think its worth going back to two different templates so anyone any ideas how to s trink this Man all this is making my head spin thinking about it Ideas anyone ' Angel Em fr bl 12 55 27 July 2006 UTC reply Most of the early translations are putting it down as ' 4 Emperors ' so for now its what I can only write it as Angel Em fr bl 10 13 25 October 2006 UTC reply Is it really nec cesar y to have Gar p's and Dragon's full name in the template it's just spoilers We could write just Gar p and Dragon right Kuri giri 22 07 22 November 2006 UTC reply I wanted to bring up the idea of designs of new templates for the One Piece articles The Templates look like this Story Arcs Related Articles Factions Characters Each Navi Template has a link to the other Templates and as you can see are smaller and neater but still allow easy movement through the articles Also the change to the General will look like this As you can see general has been split into five separate templates each to be placed on the pages featured in the template Reckless Fire 21 31 4 January 2007 UTC reply Sunday I reverted the templates back to the org in al Reason being is the same as the discussions we had a long time ago Everyone prefers one single template according to the discussion on the Main One Piece Talk Page For now though the characters template has also been removed as per discussion on how to improve things The characters now are only access able on the main template via their factions pages Then you can aces s other characters by the Character Template The trouble if we put the character back on to this template is that its likely to led to the same old template too big problem In short we are going to have to accept things as they are until we can think up something better Its s uti able have their links accessed via the factions pages this is generally a standard and acceptable layout on other anime or otherwise wikipedia pages so we shouldn't have any problems with it here Other changes include the removal of the sagas section This was because they are gone now deleted merged into one article Other all the template is now smaller and essentially a lot more suitable to wikipedia The character template needs tweaking we'll have a discussion on that later Any further suggestions anyone has feel free to bring them up We can't touch the English adp at ions bit for now due to a c ir rent discussion Otherwise this is the state of the template as of my signing this comment Angel Em fr bl 09 46 30 January 2007 UTC reply The template does not appear to be displaying season 11 on my machine despite clearing cache and giving the template a decent amount of time to update 04 06 10 January 2009 UTC reply oi season 10 is too big it needs to be broken up Like at the archipelago arc on to the current episodes should be season 11 instead of merging it together with the thriller back arc s a iyo November 13 2009",
