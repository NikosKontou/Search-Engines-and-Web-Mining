    "transformers_text": "The Latin adverbs ic s k ' thus ' ' so ' and ' in this manner ' is inserted after a quotation to indicate that the quoted matter has been transcribed or translated as found in the original source including erroneous archaic or unusual spelling punctuation and grammar 1 2 3 Sic also applies to any surprising assertion faulty reasoning or other matter that might otherwise be interpreted as an error of transcription The typical editorial usage of sic is to in form the reader that any errors in a quotation did not arise from editorial errors in the transcription but are intentionally reproduced as they appear in the original source being quoted thus sic is placed inside brackets to indicate it is not part of the quotation 1 Sic can also be used derisively to direct the reader's attention to the writer's spelling mistakes and erroneous logic or to show disapproval of the content or form of the material 1 4 In the English language the Latin adverbs ic is used as an adverb and derivative ly as a noun and as a verb 5 The adverbs ic meaning ' intentionally so written ' first appeared in English c 1856 6 It is derived from the Latin adverbs c which means ' so ' ' thus ' ' in this manner ' 7 According to the Oxford English Dictionary the verbal form of sic meaning ' to mark with asic ' emerged in 1889 E Belfort Bax's work in The Ethics of Socialism being an early example 8 On occasion sic has been misidentified as an acronym 9 and therefore sometimes misspelled with periods s i c is said to stand for spelled said in copy context spelling is correct spelled incorrectly and other such folk etymology phrases These are all incorrect and are simply backronym s from sic Use of sic greatly increased in the mid 20 th century 10 For example in United States state court opinions before 1944 sic appeared 1 239 times in the West law database in those from 1945 to 1990 it appeared 69 168 times over 55 times as many 4 Its use as a form of ridicule has been cited as a major factor in this increase 4 The immoderate use of sic has created some controversy leading some editors including bibliographical scholar Simon Nowell Smith and literary critic Leon Edel to speak out against it 11 The bracketed form sic is most often inserted into quoted or reprinted material to indicate meticulous accuracy in reproducing the preceding text despite appearances to the reader of an incorrect or unusual orthography spelling punctuation grammar syntax fact logic etc 4 12 Several usage guides recommend that a bracketed sic be used primarily as an aid to the reader not as an indicator of disagreement with the source 4 13 Sic may show that an uncommon or archaic expression is reported faithfully 14 such as when quoting the U S Constitution The House of Representatives shall ch use sic their Speaker However several writing guidebooks discourage its use with regard to dialect such as in cases of American and British English spelling differences 10 13 15 The appearance of a bracketed sic after the word analyse in a book review led Bryan A Garner to comment all the quote r or overzealous editor demonstrated was ignorance of British usage 4 Occasionally a writer places sic after their own words to indicate that the language has been chosen deliberately for special effect especially where the writer's ironic meaning may otherwise be unclear 16 Bryan A Garner dubbed this use of sic ironic providing the following example from Fred Rode ll's 1955 book Nine Men 4 I n 1951 it was the blessing bestowed on Judge Harold Medina's prosecution a sic of the eleven so called ' top native Communists ' which blessing meant giving the Smith Act the judicial nod of constitutionality Where sic follows the quotation it takes brackets sic 17 The word sic is often treated as a loanword that does not require italics and the style manuals of New Zealand Australian and British media outlets generally do not require italic is ation 13 However italic iz ation is common in the United States where authorities including APA Style insist upon it 18 Because sic is not an abbreviation placing a full stop period inside the brackets after the word sic is erroneous 19 20 although the California Style Manual suggests styling it as a parenthetical sentence only when used after a complete sentence like so Sic 17 Some guides including The Chicago Manual of Style recommend quiet copy editing unless where inappropriate or uncertain instead of inserting a bracketed sic such as by substituting in brackets the correct word in place of the incorrect word or by simply replacing an incorrect spelling with the correct one 4 21 Alternatively to show both the original and the suggested correction as they often are in palaeo graph y one may use the Latin adverb rect e meaning rightly 22 in the form of writing the actual form followed by rect e and the correct form together in brackets For example An Iraqi battalion has consumed rect e assumed control of the former American military base and our forces are now about 40 minutes outside the city According to the Journal of Seventeenth Century Music Style Sheet there should be no punctuation for example no colon before the correct form when using rect e 23 A third alternative is to follow an error with sic a comma or colon read and the correct reading all within square brackets as in the following example Item 26 ' Plan of space alongside E ving hews sic read Evening News Printing Works and overlooked by St Giles House University Hall ' Edinburgh 24",
