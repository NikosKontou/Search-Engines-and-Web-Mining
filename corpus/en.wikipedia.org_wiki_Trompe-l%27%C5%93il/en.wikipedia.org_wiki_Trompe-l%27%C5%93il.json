    "transformers_text": "Trompe l ' il French for ' deceive the eye ' tr mp l tromp LO Y French t pl j is an artistic term for the highly realistic optical illusion of three dimensional space and objects on a two dimensional surface Trompe l ' il which is most often associated with painting tricks the viewer into perceiving painted objects or spaces as real Forced perspective is a related illusion in architecture and Op art a modern style mostly dealing with geometric patterns The phrase which can also be spelled without the hyphen and ligature in English as trompe l ' oeil 1 originates with the artist Louis L opold Boil ly who used it as the title of a painting he exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1800 2 Although the term gained currency only in the early 19 th century the illusionistic technique associated with trompe l ' il dates much further back 3 It was and is often employed in murals Instances from Greek and Roman times are known for instance in Pompeii A typical trompe l ' il mural might depict a window door or hallway intended to suggest a larger room A version of an of t told ancient Greek story concerns a contest between two renowned painters Z eux is born around 464 BC produced a still life painting so convincing that birds flew down to peck at the painted grapes A rival Parr has ius asked Z eux is to judge one of his paintings that was behind a pair of tattered curtains in his study Parr has ius asked Z eux is to pull back the curtains but when Z eux is tried he could not as the curtains were included in Parr has ius's painting making Parr has ius the winner 4 A fascination with perspective drawing arose during the Renaissance But Giotto had begun using perspective at the end of the 13 th century with the cycle of Assisi in Saint Francis stories Many Italian painters of the late Quattrocento such as Andrea Mantegna 1431 1506 and Mel ozz o da Forl 1438 1494 began painting illusionistic ceiling paintings generally in fresco that employed perspective and techniques such as foreshortening to create the impression of greater space for the viewer below This type of trompe l ' il illusion is m as specifically applied to ceiling paintings is known as di s otto in s meaning from below upward in Italian The elements above the viewer are rendered as if viewed from true vanishing point perspective Well known examples are the Camera degli Sposi in Mantua and Antonio da Cor reggio's 1489 1534 Assumption of the Virgin in the Parma Cathedral Similarly Vittorio Car pac cio 1460 1525 and Jacopo de ' Barbari c 1440 before 1516 added small trompe l ' il features to their paintings playfully exploring the boundary between image and reality For example a painted fly might appear to be sitting on the painting's frame or a curtain might appear to partly conceal the painting a piece of paper might appear to be attached to a board or a person might appear to be climbing out of the painting altogether all in reference to the contest of Z eux is and Parr has ius Perspective theories in the 17 th century allowed a more fully integrated approach to architectural illusion which when used by painters to open up the space of a wall or ceiling is known as quadra tura Examples include Pietro da Cort on a's Allegory of Divine Providence in the Palazzo Barberini and Andrea P ozz o's Apotheosis of St Ignatius on the ceiling of the Roman church of Sant ' Ignaz io in Campo Marzio The Mannerist and Baroque style interiors of Jesuit churches in the 16 th and 17 th centuries often included such trompe l ' il ceiling paintings which optically open the ceiling or dome to the heavens with a depiction of Jesus ' Mary's or a saint's ascension or assumption An example of a perfect architectural trompe l ' il is the illusionistic dome in the Jesuit church Vienna by Andrea P ozz o which is only slightly curved but gives the impression of true architecture Trompe l ' il paintings became very popular in Flemish and later in Dutch painting in the 17 th century arising from the development of still life painting The Flemish painter Cornelis Norbert us Gy s brecht s created a chan tour n painting showing an easel holding a painting Chan tour n literally means ' cut out ' and refers to a trompe l ' il representation designed to stand away from a wall 5 The Dutch painter Samuel Dirks z van Hoo g stra ten was a master of the trompe l ' il and theorized on the role of art as the lifelike imitation of nature in his 1678 book the Introduction to the Academy of Painting or the Visible World In ley ding to t de hoo ge school e der s childe rk on st anders de zi ch tb aere were lt Rotterdam 1678 6 7 A fanciful form of architectural trompe l ' il quo d li bet features realistically rendered paintings of such items as paper knives playing cards ribbons and scissors apparently accidentally left lying around 8 Trompe l ' il can also be found painted on tables and other items of furniture on which for example a deck of playing cards might appear to be sitting on the table A particularly impressive example can be seen at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire where one of the internal doors appears to have a violin and bow suspended from it in a trompe l ' il painted around 1723 by Jan van der Va art 9 Another example can be found in the Painted Hall at the Old Royal Naval College Greenwich London This Wren building was painted by Sir James Thornhill the first British born painter to be knighted and is a classic example of the Baroque style popular in the early 18 th century The American 19 th century still life painter William Harnett specialized in trompe l ' il In the 20 th century from the 1960 s on the American Richard Haas and many others painted large trompe l ' il murals on the sides of city buildings From the beginning of the 1980 s when German artist Rainer Maria La tz ke began to combine classical fresco art with contemporary content trompe l ' il became increasingly popular for interior murals The Spanish painter Salvador Dal utilized the technique for a number of his paintings 10 Trompe l ' il in the form of forced perspective has long been used in stage theater set design so as to create the illusion of a much deeper space than the existing stage A famous early example is the Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza with Vincenzo Scam ozz i's seven forced perspective streets 1585 which appear to recede into the distance Trompe l ' il is employed in Donald O ' Connor's famous Running up the wall scene in the film Singin ' in the Rain 1952 During the finale of his Make ' em Laugh number he first runs up a real wall Then he runs towards what appears to be a hallway but when he runs up this as well we realize that it is a large trompe l ' il mural More recently Roy Andersson has made use of similar techniques in his feature films 11 Matte painting is a variant of trompe l ' il and is used in film production with elements of a scene are painted on glass panels mounted in front of the camera Elsa S chia p are lli frequently made use of trompe l ' il in her designs most famously perhaps in her Bow knot Sweater which some consider to be the first use of trompe l ' il in fashion The Tears Dress which she did in collaboration with Salvador Dal features both appliqu tears on the veil and trompe l ' il tears on the dress itself 12 Fictional trompe l ' il appears in many Looney Tunes such as the Road Runner cartoons where for example Wile E Coyote paints a tunnel on a rock wall and Road Runner then races through the fake tunnel This is usually followed by the coyote's foolishly trying to run through the tunnel after the road runner only to smash into the hard rock face This sight gag was employed in Who Framed Roger Rabbit In Chicago's Near North Side Richard Haas used a 16 story 1929 apartment hotel converted into a 1981 apartment building for trompe l ' il murals in homage to Chicago school architecture One of the building's sides features the Chicago Board of Trade Building intended as a reflection of the building located two miles south 13 14 Several contemporary artists use chalk on pavement or sidewalk to create trompe l ' il works a technique called street painting or pavement art These creations last only until washed away and therefore must be photographed to be preserved Practitioners of this form include Julian Be ever Edgar Mueller Leon Kee r and Kurt We nner The Palazzo Sal is of Ti rano Italy has over centuries and throughout the palace used trompe l ' il in place of more expensive real masonry doors staircases balconies and draperies to create an illusion of sumptuous ness and opulence 15 Trompe l ' il in the form of illusion architecture and L ft l male rei is common on fa ades in the Alpine region Trompe l ' il in the form of illusion painting is also used in contemporary interior design where illusion ary wall paintings experienced a renaissance since around 1980 Significant artists in this field are the German muralist Rainer Maria La tz ke who invented in the 1990 s a new method of producing illusion paintings fresco graph y and the English artist Graham Rust OK Go's music video for The Writing's on the Wall uses a number of trompe l ' il illusions alongside other optical illusions captured through a one shot take 16 Trompe l ' il illusions have been used as gameplay mechanics in video games such as The Witness and Super lim in al 17 Japanese filmmaker and animator Isao Taka hat a regarded achieving a sense of trompe l ' il to be important for his work stating that an animated world should feel as if it existed right there so that people believe in a fantasy world and characters that no one has seen in reality 18 Tourist attractions employing large scale illusory art allowing visitors to photograph
