or less commonly the vinegar fly po mace fly a 5 or banana fly 6 In the wild D melanogaster are attracted to rotting fruit and fermenting beverages and they are often found in orchards kitchens and pubs Starting with Charles W Wood worth's 1901 proposal of the use of this species as a model organism 7 8 D melanogaster continues to be widely used for biological research in genetics physiology microbial pathogen es is and life history evolution In 1946 D melanogaster was the first animal to be launched into space 9 As of 2017 six Nobel Prizes have been awarded to dr oso phi lists for their work using the insect 10 11 Drosophila melanogaster is typically used in research owing to its rapid life cycle relatively simple genetics with only four pairs of chromosomes and large number of offspring per generation 12 It was originally an African species with all non African lineages having a common origin 13 Its geographic range includes all continents including islands 14 D melanogaster is a common pest in homes restaurants and other places where food is served 15 Flies belonging to the family Te phr it i dae are also called fruit flies This can cause confusion especially in the Mediterranean Australia and South Africa where the Mediterranean fruit fly Cer at it is capita ta is an economic pest The term Drosophila meaning dew loving is a modern scientific Latin adaptation from Greek words dr sos dew and phil a lover The term melanogaster meaning black belly comes from Ancient Greek m las black and gast r belly citation needed Wild type fruit flies are yellow brown with brick red eyes and transverse black rings across the abdomen The fly's body is divided into three main parts head thorax and abdomen The head is relatively round and features large prominent red compound eyes These eyes are made up of hundreds of ommatidia and occupy most of the head's surface The brick red color of the eyes of the wild type fly are due to two pigments x an thomm at in which is brown and is derived from tryptophan and d ros opt erin s which are red and are derived from guano sine triphosphate 16 Between the eyes are short antennae which look like tiny feathery or bristled projections and are used for detecting odors air currents and vibrations 17 Drosophila also has bristles short stiff hairs distributed across the head and body which are useful for tactile sensing The thorax is robust and bears three pairs of legs and one pair of wings The wings are clear and membranous with fine veins visible and span approximately 4 mm 18 They are held flat over the back when the fly is at rest Just behind the wings are small knob like structures called halteres which are modified hindwings These help the fly maintain balance and orientation in flight 19 The drosophila legis composed of five leg segments the cox a trochanter femur tibia and tarsus They have five tarsal segments in their tarsus ending with the fly foot which has multiple structures including the claw and adhesive structures The pul vil lus a flexible elongated structure underneath the claw and set a e hair like structures that are spatula shaped and in set the pul villi are the main attachment devices used by D melanogaster Although their claws may be used for attachment on to rough surfaces 20 Males also have sex combs located on the first tarsal segment which are tiny bristle like structures on their front legs used to attach to females during mating Extensive images are found at Fly Base 21 The abdomen is segmented and tapers toward the end It often appears striped with alternating bands of light and dark pigmentation In males the abdomen is typically darker and more rounded while females have a more pointed and striped abdomen The black portions of the abdomen are the inspiration for the species name melanogaster black bellied They exhibit sexual dimorphism females are about 2 5 mm 0 10 in long while males are slightly smaller Females have bodies that are up to 30 larger than an adult male 22 23 Unlike humans the sex and physical appearance of fruit flies is not influenced by hormones 24 The appearance and sex of fruit flies is determined only by genetic information 24 Drosophila melanogaster can be distinguished from related species by the following combination of features gen a 1 10 diameter of eye at greatest vertical height wing hyaline and with cost al index 2 4 male pro tarsus with a single row of 12 set a e forming a sex comb male ep and rial posterior lobe small and nearly triangular female abdominal ter g it e 6 with dark band running to its ventral margin female ovis capt small pale without dor so distal depression and with 12 13 peg like outer ovis en silla 25 26 Under optimal growth conditions at 25 C 77 F the D melanogaster lifespan is about 50 days from egg to death 27 The developmental period forD melanogaster varies with temperature as with many ect other mic species The shortest development time egg to adult seven days is achieved at 28 C 82 F 28 29 Development times increase at higher temperatures 11 days at 30 C or 86 F due to heat stress Under ideal conditions the development time at 25 C 77 F is 8 1 2 days 28 29 30 at 18 C 64 F it takes 19 days 28 29 and at 12 C 54 F it takes over 50 days 28 29 Under crowded conditions development time increases 31 while the emerging flies are smaller 31 32 Females lay some 400 eggs embryos about five at a time into rotting fruit or other suitable material such as decaying mushrooms and sap fluxes Drosophila melanogaster is a hol o meta bo lou s insect so it undergoes a full metamorphosis Their life cycle is broken down into four stages embryo larva pupa adult 33 The eggs which are about 0 5 mm long hatch after 12 15 hours at 25 C or 77 F 28 29 The resulting larvae grow for about four days at 25 C while molting twice into second and third in star larvae at about 24 and 48 hours after hatching 28 29 During this time they feed on the microorganisms that decompose the fruit as well as on the sugar of the fruit itself The mother puts feces on the egg sacs to establish the same microbial composition in the larvae's guts that has worked positively for herself 34 Then the larvae encapsulate in the pupa rium and undergo a four day long metamorphosis at 25 C after which the adults e close emerge 28 29 Males perform a sequence of five behavioral patterns to court females First males orient themselves while playing a courtship song by horizontally extending and vibrating their wings Soon after the male positions himself at the rear of the female's abdomen in a low posture to tap and lick the female genitalia Finally the male curls his abdomen and attempts copulation Females can reject males by moving away kicking and extruding their ovipositor 35 Copulation lasts around 15 20 minutes 36 during which males transfer a few hundred very long 1 76 mm sperm cells in seminal fluid to the female 37 Females store the sperm in a tubular receptacle and in two mushroom shaped sperm a the cae sperm from multiple matings compete for fertilization A last male precedence is believed to exist the last male to mate with a female sires about 80 of her offspring This precedence was found to occur through both displacement and incapacitation 38 The displacement is attributed to sperm handling by the female fly as multiple matings are conducted and is most significant during the first 1 2 days after copulation Displacement from the seminal receptacle is more significant than displacement from the sperm a the cae 38 Incapacitation of first male sperm by second male sperm becomes significant 2 7 days after copulation The seminal fluid of the second male is believed to be responsible for this incapacitation mechanism without removal of first male sperm which takes effect before fertilization occurs 38 The delay in effectiveness of the incapacitation mechanism is believed to be a protective mechanism that prevents a male fly from incapacitating his own sperm should he mate with the same female fly repetitive ly Sensory neurons in the uterus of female D melanogaster respond to a male protein sex peptide which is found in semen 39 This protein makes the female reluctant to copulate for about 10 days after insemination The signal pathway leading to this change in behavior has been determined The signal is sent to a brain region that is a homolog of the hypothalamus and the hypothalamus then controls sexual behavior and desire 39 Gona do tropic hormones in Drosophila maintain homeostasis and govern reproductive output via a cyclic interrelationship not unlike the mammalian estro us cycle 40 Sex peptide perturbs this homeostasis and dramatically shifts the endocrine state of the female by inciting juvenile hormone synthesis in the corpus all atum 41 D melanogaster is often used for life extension studies such as to identify genes purported to increase lifespan when mutated 42 D melanogaster is also used in studies of aging Werner syndrome is a condition in humans characterized by accelerated aging It is caused by mutations in the ge neW RN that encodes a protein with essential roles in repair of DNA damage Mutations in the D melanogaster homolog of W RN also cause increased ph y sio logic signs of aging such as shorter lifespan higher tumor incidence muscle degeneration reduced climbing ability altered behavior and reduced loco motor activity 43 Mei o tic recombination in D melanogaster appears to be employed in repairing damage in germ line DNA as indicated by the findings that mei o tic recombination is induced by the DNA damaging agents ultraviolet light 44 and mito my c in C 45 Females become receptive to courting males about 8 12 hours after emergence 46 Specific neuron groups in females have been found to affect copulation behavior and mate choice One such group in the abdominal nerve cord allows the female fly to pause her body movements to copulate 39 Activation of these neurons induces the female to cease movement and orient herself towards the male to allow for mounting If the group is in activated the female remains in motion and does not copulate Various chemical signals such as male pheromones often are able to activate the group 39 Also females exhibit mate choice copying When virgin females are shown other females copulating with a certain type of male they tend to copulate more with this type of male afterwards than na ve females which have not observed the copulation of others This behavior is sensitive to environmental conditions and females copulate less in bad weather conditions 47 D melanogaster males exhibit a strong reproductive learning curve That is with sexual experience these flies tend to modify their future mating behavior in multiple ways These changes include increased selectivity for courting only intra specifically as well as decreased courtship times Sexually na veD melanogaster males are known to spend significant time courting inter specifically such as with D si mulan s flies Na veD melanogaster will also attempt to court females that are not yet sexually mature and other males D melanogaster males show little to no preference forD melanogaster females over females of other species or even other male flies However after D si mulan s or other flies incapable of copulation have rejected the males ' advances D melanogaster males are much less likely to spend time courting non specifically in the future This apparent learned behavior modification seems to be evolutionarily significant as it allows the males to avoid investing energy into futile sexual encounters 48 In addition males with previous sexual experience modify their courtship dance when attempting to mate with new females the experienced males spend less time courting so have lower mating latencies meaning that they are able to reproduce more quickly This decreased mating latency leads to a greater mating efficiency for experienced males over na ve males 49 This modification also appears to have obvious evolutionary advantages as increased mating efficiency is extremely important in the eyes of natural selection Both male and female D melanogaster flies act polygamous ly having multiple sexual partners at the same time 50 In both males and females polygamy results in a decrease in evening activity compared to virgin flies more so in males than females 50 Evening activity consists of those in which the flies participate other than mating and finding partners such as finding food 51 The reproductive success of males and females varies because a female only needs to mate once to reach maximum fertility 51 Mating with multiple partners provides no advantage over mating with one partner so females exhibit no difference in evening activity between polygamous and monogamous individuals 51 For males however mating with multiple partners increases their reproductive success by increasing the genetic diversity of their offspring 51 This benefit of genetic diversity is an evolutionary advantage because it increases the chance that some of the offspring will have traits that increase their fitness in their environment The difference in evening activity between polygamous and monogamous male flies can be explained with courtship For polygamous flies their reproductive success increases by having offspring with multiple partners and therefore they spend more time and energy on courting multiple females 51 On the other hand monogamous flies only court one female and expend less energy doing so 51 While it requires more energy for male flies to court multiple females the overall reproductive benefits it produces has kept polygamy as the preferred sexual choice 51 The mechanism that affects courtship behavior in Drosophila is controlled by the oscillator neurons DN 1 s and L NDs 52 Oscillation of the DN 1 neurons was found to be effected by socio sexual interactions and is connected to mating related decrease of evening activity 52 D melanogaster remains one of the most studied organisms in biological research particularly in genetics and developmental biology It is also employed in studies of environmental mutagen es is citation needed D melanogaster was among the first organisms used for genetic analysis and today it is one of the most widely used and genetically best known of all eukaryotic organisms All organisms use common genetic systems therefore comprehending processes such as transcription and replication in fruit flies helps in understanding these processes in other eukaryotes including humans 53 Thomas Hunt Morgan began using fruit flies in experimental studies of heredity at Columbia University in 1910 in a laboratory known as the Fly Room The Fly Room was cramped with eight desks each occupied by students and their experiments They started off experiments using milk bottles to rear the fruit flies and handheld lenses for observing their traits The lenses were later replaced by microscopes which enhanced their observations Morgan and his students eventually elucidated many basic principles of heredity including sex linked inheritance epistasis multiple alleles and gene mapping 53 D melanogaster had historically been used in laboratories to study genetics and patterns of inheritance However D melanogaster also has importance in environmental mutagen es is research allowing researchers to study the effects of specific environmental mutagens 54 There are many reasons the fruit fly is a popular choice as a model organism citation needed Genetic markers are commonly used in Drosophila research for example within balancer chromosomes or P element inserts and most phenotypes are easily identifiable either with the naked eye or under a microscope In the list of a few common markers below the allele symbol is followed by the name of the gene affected and a description of its phenotype Note Recessive alleles are in lower case while dominant alleles are capitalised Drosophila genes are traditionally named after the phenotype they cause when mutated For example the absence of a particular gene in Drosophila will result in a mutant embryo that does not develop a heart Scientists have thus called this genet in man named after the Oz character of the same name 58 Likewise changes in the Shaven baby gene cause the loss of dorsal cut icu lar hairs in Drosophila sec hell i a larvae 59 This system of nomenclature results in a wider range of gene names than in other organisms The genome of D melanogaster sequenced in 2000 and curate d at the Fly Base database 55 contains four pairs of chromosomes an X Y pair and three auto some s labeled 2 3 and 4 The fourth chromosome is relatively very small and therefore often ignored aside from its important eyeless gene The D melanogaster sequenced genome of 139 5 million base pairs has been annotated 82 and contains around 15 682 genes Ensemble release 73 including 13 822 protein coding genes 83 More than 60 of the genome appears to be functional non protein coding DNA 84 Determination of sex in Drosophila occurs by the X A ratio of X chromosomes to auto some s not because of the presence of a Y chromosome as in human sex determination Although the Y chromosome is entirely he t ero chromatic it contains at least 16 genes many of which are thought to have male related functions 85 There are three transfer r in ortho logs all of which are dramatically divergent from those known in chordate models 86 A June 2001 study by National Human Genome Research Institute comparing the fruit fly and human genome estimated that about 60 of genes are conserved between the two species 87 About 75 of known human disease genes have a recognizable match in the genome of fruit flies 88 and 50 of fly protein sequences have mammalian homolog s citation needed An online database called Homo phil a is available to search for human disease gene homologue s in flies and vice versa 89 Drosophila is being used as a genetic model for several human diseases including the neuro degenerative disorders Parkinson's Huntington's s pino cerebella r a taxi a and Alzheimer's disease 90 The fly is also being used to study mechanisms underlying aging and oxidative stress immunity diabetes and cancer as well as drug abuse 91 92 93 The life cycle of this insect has four stages fertilized egg larva pupa and adult 14 Embryo genesis in Drosophila has been extensively studied as its small size short generation time and large brood size makes it ideal for genetic studies It is also unique among model organisms in that cleavage occurs in a syncytium During oogenesis cytoplasmic bridges called ring canals connect the forming oo cyte to nurse cells Nutrients and developmental control molecules move from the nurse cells into the oo cyte In the figure to the left the forming oo cyte can be seen to be covered by follicular support cells citation needed After fertilization of the oo cyte the early embryo or syncytial embryo undergoes rapid DNA replication and 13 nuclear divisions until about 5000 to 6000 nuclei accumulate in the un separated cytoplasm of the embryo By the end of the eighth division most nuclei have migrated to the surface surrounding the yolk sac leaving behind only a few nuclei which will become the yolk nuclei After the 10 th division the pole cells form at the posterior end of the embryo segregating the germ line from the syncytium Finally after the 13 th division cell membranes slowly in vagina te dividing the syncytium into individual somatic cells Once this process is completed gastrulation starts 94 Nuclear division in the early Drosophila embryo happens so quickly no proper checkpoints exist so mistakes may be made in division of the DNA To get around this problem the nuclei that have made a mistake detach from their centrosomes and fall into the centre of the embryo yolk sac which will not form part of the fly citation needed The gene network transcriptional and protein interactions governing the early development of the fruit fly embryo is one of the best understood gene networks to date especially the patterning along the antero posterior AP and dor so ventral DV axes See under morphogenesis 94 The embryo undergoes well characterized morphogenetic movements during gastrulation and early development including germ band extension formation of several furrows ventral in vagina tion of the mesoderm and posterior and anterior in vagina tion of endoderm gut as well as extensive body segmentation until finally hatching from the surrounding cuticle into a first in star larva citation needed During larval development tissues known as i magi nal discs grow inside the larva I magi nal discs develop to form most structures of the adult body such as the head legs wings thorax and genitalia Cells of the i magi nal disks are set aside during embryo genesis and continue to grow and divide during the larval stages unlike most other cells of the larva which have differentiated to perform specialized functions and grow without further cell division At metamorphosis the larva forms a pupa inside which the larval tissues are reabsorbed and the i magi nal tissues undergo extensive morphogenetic movements to form adult structures Biotic and abiotic factors experienced during development will affect developmental resource allocation leading to phenotypic variation also referred to as developmental plasticity 95 96 As in all insects 96 environmental factors can influence several aspects of development in Drosophila melanogaster 97 98 Fruit flies reared under a hypoxia treatment experience decreased thorax length while hyper o xia produces smaller flight muscles suggesting negative developmental effects of extreme oxygen levels 99 Circadian rhythms are also subject to developmental plasticity Light conditions during development affect daily activity patterns in Drosophila melanogaster where flies raised under constant dark or light are less active as adults than those raised under a 12 hour light dark cycle 100 Temperature is one of the most pervasive factors influencing arthropod development In Drosophila melanogaster temperature induced developmental plasticity can be beneficial and or detrimental 101 102 Most often lower developmental temperatures reduce growth rates which influence many other physiological factors 103 For example development at 25 C increases walking speed thermal performance breadth and territorial success while development at 18 C increases body mass wing size all of which are tied to fitness 98 101 Moreover developing at certain low temperatures produces proportionally large wings which improve flight and reproductive performance at similarly low temperatures See acclimation 104 While certain effects of developmental temperature like body size are irreversible in ect other ms others can be reversible 96 105 When Drosophila melanogaster develop at cold temperatures they will have greater cold tolerance but if cold reared flies are maintained at warmer temperatures their cold tolerance decreases and heat tolerance increases over time 105 106 Because insects typically only mate in a specific range of temperatures their cold heat tolerance is an important trait in maximizing reproductive output 107 While the traits described above are expected to manifest similarly across sexes developmental temperature can also produce sex specific effects in D melanogaster adults Drosophila flies have both X and Y chromosomes as well as auto some s Unlike humans the Y chromosome does not confer maleness rather it encodes genes necessary for making sperm Sex is instead determined by the ratio of X chromosomes to auto some s 112 Furthermore each cell decides whether to be male or female independently of the rest of the organism resulting in the occasional occurrence of gy n and ro morphs Three major genes are involved in determination of Drosophila sex These are sex lethal sister less and deadpan Deadpan is an autosomal gene which inhibits sex lethal while sister less is carried on the X chromosome and inhibits the action of deadpan An A A X cell has twice as much deadpan as sister less so sex lethal will be inhibited creating a male However an A A XX cell will produce enough sister less to inhibit the action of deadpan allowing the sex lethal gene to be transcribed to create a female Later control by deadpan and sister less disappears and what becomes important is the form of the sex lethal gene A secondary promoter causes transcription in both males and females Analysis of the c DNA has shown that different forms are expressed in males and females Sex lethal has been shown to affect the splicing of its own mRNA In males the third exon is included which encodes a stop codon causing a truncated form to be produced In the female version the presence of sex lethal causes this exon to be missed out the other seven amino acids are produced as a full peptide chain again giving a difference between males and females 113 Presence or absence of functional sex lethal proteins now go on to affect the transcription of another protein known as double sex In the absence of sex lethal double sex will have the fourth exon removed and be translated up to and including exon 6 DS X M ale while in its presence the fourth exon which encodes a stop codon will produce a truncated version of the protein DS X F e male DS X F causes transcription of Yolk proteins 1 and 2 in somatic cells which will be pumped into the oo cyte on its production The D melanogaster immune system can be divided into two responses humoral and cell mediated The former is a systemic response mediated in large part through the tollan dIm d pathways which are parallel systems for detecting microbes Other pathways including the stress response pathways JAK STAT and P 38 nutritional signalling via FOX O and J NK cell death signalling are all involved in key physiological responses to infection D melanogaster has an organ called the fat body which is analogous to the human liver The fat body is the primary secretory organ and produces key immune molecules upon infection such as seri ne protease s and antimicrobial peptides AMPs AMPs are secreted into the he mo lymph and bind infectious bacteria and fungi killing them by forming pores in their cell walls or inhibiting intracellular processes The cellular immune response instead refers to the direct activity of blood cells he mo cyte s in Drosophila which are analogous to mammalian monocytes macrophages He mo cyte s also possess a significant role in mediating humoral immune responses such as theme la niz ation reaction 114 The immune response to infection can involve up to 2 423 genes or 13 7 of the genome Although the fly's transcriptional response to microbial challenge is highly specific to individual pathogens Drosophila differential ly expresses a core group of 252 genes upon infection with most bacteria This core group of genes is associated with gene ontology categories such as antimicrobial response stress response secretion neuron like reproduction and metabolism among others 115 116 Drosophila also possesses several immune mechanisms to both shape the micro biota and prevent excessive immune responses upon detection of microbial stimuli For instance secreted PG RPs with amida se activity scavenge and degrade immuno sti mula tory DAP type PG N in order to block I md activation 117 Unlike mammals Drosophila have innate immunity but lack an adaptive immune response However the core elements of this innate immune response are conserved between humans and fruit flies As a result the fruit fly offers a useful model of innate immunity for disentangling genetic interactions of signalling and effect or function as flies do not have to contend with interference of adaptive immune mechanisms that could confuse results Various genetic tools protocols and as says make Drosophila a classical model for studying the innate immune system 118 which has even included immune research on the international space station 119 Multiple elements of the Drosophila JAK STAT signalling pathway bear direct homolog y to human JAK STAT pathway genes JAK STAT signalling is induced upon various organism al stresses such as heat stress dehydration or infection JAK STAT induction leads to the production of a number of stress response proteins including Th io ester containing proteins T EPs 120 Turandot s 121 and the putative antimicrobial peptide List eric in 122 The mechanisms through which many of these proteins act is still under investigation For instance the T EPs appear to promote phagocytosis of Gram positive bacteria and the induction of the toll pathway As a consequence flies lacking T EPs are susceptible to infection by toll pathway challenges 120 Circulating he mo cyte s are key regulators of infection This has been demonstrated both through genetic tools to generate flies lacking he mo cyte s or through injecting micro glass beads or lipid droplets that saturate he mo cyte ability to ph ago cyto se a secondary infection 123 124 Flies treated like this fail to ph ago cyto se bacteria upon infection and are correspondingly susceptible to infection 125 These he mo cyte s derive from two waves of he mato poi es is one occurring in the early embryo and one occurring during development from larva to adult 126 However Drosophila he mo cyte s do not renew over the adult lifespan and so the fly has a finite number of he mo cyte s that decrease over the course of its lifespan 127 He mo cyte s are also involved in regulating cell cycle events and apoptosis of aberrant tissue e g cancerous cells by producing E iger a tumor necrosis factor signalling molecule that promotes J NK signalling and ultimately cell death and apoptosis 128 In 1971 Ron Konopka and Seymour Benzer published Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster a paper describing the first mutations that affected an animal's behavior Since then Benzer and others have used behavioral screens to isolate genes involved in vision olfaction audition learning memory courtship pain aggression grooming and other processes such as longevity citation needed Wild type flies show an activity rhythm with a frequency of about a day 24 hours Benzer and others found mutants with faster and slower rhythms as well as broken rhythms flies that move and rest in random spurts Work over the following 30 years has shown that these mutations and others like them affect a group of genes and their products that form a biochemical or biological clock This clock is found in a wide range of fly cells but the clock bearing cells that control activity are several dozen neurons in the fly's central brain citation needed The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 2017 was awarded to Jeffrey C Hall Michael Ros bash Michael W Young for their works using fruit flies in understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm 129 Following the pioneering work of Alfred Henry Sturtevant 130 and others Benzer and colleagues 56 used sexual mosaics to develop a novel fate mapping technique This technique made it possible to assign a particular characteristic to a specific anatomical location For example this technique showed that male courtship behavior is controlled by the brain 56 Mosaic fate mapping also provided the first indication of the existence of pheromones in this species 131 Males distinguish between con specific males and females and direct persistent courtship preferentially toward females thanks to a female specific sex pheromone which is mostly produced by the female's tergites Male flies sing to the females during courtship using their wings to generate sound and some of the genetics of sexual behavior have been characterized In particular the fruitless gene has several different splice forms and male flies expressing female splice forms have female like behavior and vice versa The TRP channels no mpC nan chung and inactive are expressed in sound sensitive Johnston's organ neurons and participate in the transduction of sound 132 133 Mutating the Gender blind gene also known as CG 6070 alters the sexual behavior of Drosophila turning the flies bisexual 134 The first learning and memory mutants dunce rutabaga etc were isolated by William Chip Quinn while in Benzer's lab and were eventually shown to encode components of an intracellular signaling pathway involving cyclic AMP protein kina se A and a transcription factor known as C REB These molecules were shown to be also involved in synaptic plasticity in A ply sia and mammals 135 The compound eye of the fruit fly contains 760 unit eyes or ommatidia and are one of the most advanced among insects Each ommatidium contains eight photoreceptor cells R 1 8 support cells pigment cells and a cornea Wild type flies have reddish pigment cells which serve to absorb excess blue light so the fly is not blinded by ambient light Eye color genes regulate cellular ves icu lar transport The enzymes needed for pigment synthesis are then transported to the cell's pigment granule which holds pigment precursor molecules 68 Each photoreceptor cell consists of two main sections the cell body and the rh ab do mere The cell body contains the nucleus while the 100 m long rh ab do mere is made up of toothbrush like stacks of membrane called microvilli Each microvillus is 1 2 m in length and about 60 nm in diameter 136 The membrane of the rh ab do mere is packed with about 100 million ops in molecules the visual protein that absorbs light The other visual proteins are also tightly packed into the microvilli leaving little room for cytoplasm About two thirds of the Drosophila brain is dedicated to visual processing 137 Although the spatial resolution of their vision is significantly worse than that of humans their temporal resolution is around 10 times better Flies use a modified version of Bloom filters to detect novelty of odors with additional features including similarity of novel odor to that of previously experienced examples and time elapsed since previous experience of the same odor 138 Like many other hex a pod insects Drosophila typically walk using a tripod gait 140 This means that three of the legs swing together while the other three remain stationary or in stance Specifically the middle leg moves in phase with the contra lateral front and hind legs However variability around the tripod configuration exists along a continuum meaning that flies do not exhibit distinct transitions between different gaits 141 At fast walking speeds the walking configuration is mostly tripod three legs in stance but at slower walking speeds flies are more likely to have four tetrapod or five legs in stance wave 142 143 These transitions may help to optimize static stability 144 Because flies are so small inertial forces are negligible compared with the elastic forces of their muscles and joints or the viscous forces of the surrounding air 145 Flies fly via straight sequences of movement interspersed by rapid turns called s acca des 146 During these turns a fly is able to rotate 90 degrees in less than 50 milliseconds 146 Characteristics of Drosophila flight may be dominated by the viscosity of the air rather than the inertia of the fly body but the opposite case with inertia as the dominant force may occur 146 However subsequent work showed that while the viscous effects on the insect body during flight may be negligible the aerodynamic forces on the wings themselves actually cause fruit flies ' turns to be damped viscous ly 147 Drosophila is one of the few animals C elegans being another where detailed neural circuits connect ome s of the brain and nerve cord are available The larval brain and nerve cord consist of 3 016 neurons and 548 000 synapses 148 The Drosophila adult central nervous system brain plus ventral nerve cord has been reconstructed in both the male 149 and the female 150 and contains around 160 000 neurons and over 200 million synapses These datasets allow scientists to generate testable hypotheses about how the brain processes information and gives rise to behavior 151 Drosophila is sometimes referred to as a pest due to its tendency to live in human settlements where fermenting fruit is found Flies may collect in homes restaurants stores and other locations 15 The name and behavior of this species of fly have led to the misconception that it is a biological security risk in Australia and elsewhere While other fruit fly species do pose a risk D melanogaster is attracted to fruit that is already rotting rather than causing fruit to rot 152 153",
