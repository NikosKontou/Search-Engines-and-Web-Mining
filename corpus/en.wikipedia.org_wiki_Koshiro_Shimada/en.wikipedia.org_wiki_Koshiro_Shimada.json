[ 8 ]\n\nShimada began the season by winning gold on the junior level of the 2016 Asian Open Trophy . He then went on to compete on the 2016–17 Junior Grand Prix series, he won the bronze medal at 2016 JGP France and finishing fourth at 2016 JGP Estonia . Following a second-place finish in the junior level and a seventh-place finish of the 2016–17 Japan Championships , Shimada was assigned to compete at the 2017 World Junior Championships in Taipei , Taiwan, where he placed fourteenth. [ 8 ]\n\nIn the spring of 2017, Shimada relocated to Champéry , Switzerland to train under Stéphane Lambiel . [ 9 ]\n\nDuring the off-season, Shimada tore his left hip abductor muscle. In July, he underwent rehabilitation with a physiotherapist in Toronto , Canada. [ 10 ]\n\nHe did end up competing on the 2017–18 Junior Grand Prix series, finishing fifth at 2017 JGP Croatia and seventh at 2017 JGP Poland . Shimada would not compete for the remainder of the season. [ 7 ]\n\nAfter almost a full year of not competing, Shimada started the season by competing on the 2018–19 Junior Grand Prix series. He won the silver medal at 2018 JGP Austria and the bronze medal at 2018 JGP Slovenia . With these results, Shimada qualified for the 2018–19 Junior Grand Prix Final in Vancouver, British Columbia , Canada. [ 8 ]\n\nFollowing a bronze medal win at the 2018–19 Japan Junior Championships , Shimada won also win bronze at the Junior Grand Prix Final.

Shimada then finished the season by placing tenth at the 2019–20 Japan Championships . [ 7 ]\n\nAlthough Shimada was assigned to compete at the 2020 Internationaux de France, the event was ultimately cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] His only other competition was the 2020–21 Japan Championships , where he finished eighth.

[ 13 ] He was only sixth in the free skate, struggling with a number of jumps, but he remained second overall, less than two points ahead of bronze medalist Kazuki Tomono . [ 14 ] Despite being the national silver medalist, the Japan Skating Federation 's selection criteria for the 2023 World Championships led to his not being named to one of Japan's three berths, which drew protest from Shimada's friend and training partner, Japanese national champion Shoma Uno .

He ultimately placed tenth at the event, and said he hoped his ankle would be healed in time for his second Grand Prix event. [ 18 ] He went on to finish sixth at the 2023 Grand Prix of Espoo . [ 19 ] “I feel better than at the GP in France,” he said after the free skate. [ 20 ]\n\nHe would close the season with an eleventh-place finish at the 2023–24 Japan Championships . [ 8 ]\n\nDuring the off-season, Shimada was cast to portray a younger version of the character Tokio , played by Takurō Ōno , as well as several other roles in the cross-genre ice show Hyoen - The Miracle of the Cross , a loose adaptation of Kenji Miyazawa's novel Night on the Galactic Railroad , starring Daisuke Takahashi .\n\nBeginning his season by competing on the 2024–25 Grand Prix series, Shimada finished sixth at 2024 Skate America .

[ 8 ] [ 21 ] Shimada expressed elation at this result, saying, \"I still can't believe that I am here in the medals. I've worked with Stéphane for such a long time, I appreciate his support so much. I want to thank him dearly for all of put hard work together. Last night he told me “you're the best”, and put me in a really positive mindset. I was really calm ahead of my skate today and in a really positive mindset.\" [ 22 ]\n\nIn December, Shimada placed ninth at the 2024–25 Japan Championships . [ 8 ]\n\nIn May, it was announced that Shimada had teamed up with fellow singles skater, Ikura Kushida , with the intention switching to the ice dance discipline. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] It was subsequently announced that the pair would be coached by Cathy Reed at the Kinoshita Academy in Kyoto . [ 25 ]\n\nDuring the summer, Shimada was cast as Inukai Takeru in the storytelling ice show Hyoen – Mirror-Patterend Demon , starring Daisuke Takahashi and Takahisa Masuda . [ 26 ]\n\nIn late October, Kushida/Shimada debuted as a team at the 2025 Western Sectional Championships, a qualifying competition for the Japanese National Championships , where they won the event, almost sixteen points ahead of the second placed team, Sasaki/Ikeda.
