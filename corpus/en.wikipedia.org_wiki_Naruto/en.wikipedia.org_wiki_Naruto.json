honorable mention in the 1996 Hop Step Award Dissatisfied with subsequent draft proposals Kishimoto began developing a new project 2 An early concept featured Naruto as a chef but this version was never published Kishimoto then developed a one shot for the summer 1997 issue of Aka maru Jump based on an idea of a boy who could transform into a fox 3 4 Despite positive reader feedback Kishimoto revised the concept into a ninja themed story due to dissatisfaction with the art and narrative 5 The first eight chapters were planned prior to serialization in Weekly Sh nen Jump Initial drafts featured detailed illustrations of Konoha village but by the debut the art emphasized characters over backgrounds 5 Although Kishimoto was concerned that the use of chakra might make the series overly Japanese he believed it remained engaging 6 Inspired by Godzilla Kishimoto incorporated the tailed beasts mythology to include monster designs 7 The central theme of Part I is mutual acceptance exemplified through Naruto's character development 8 In Part II Kishimoto simplified panel layouts and plot structures to enhance readability and avoid excessive stylistic conventions 9 His artistic style shifted from a classic manga aesthetic toward greater realism 9 To conclude the Sasuke Uchiha arc within one volume volume 43 contained additional chapters leading Kishimoto to apologize for the higher cost 10 Kishimoto drew inspiration from other sh nen manga while developing characters aiming for distinctiveness within a Japanese cultural framework 11 Characters were organized into teams to highlight specialized skills and complementary weaknesses 12 While romance was challenging to write it received greater emphasis in Part II starting with volume 28 8 Villains were introduced to contrast moral values and highlight ideological conflicts 13 An ellipsis was used to allow younger characters to age and develop strength as they were initially out matched by antagonists 14 Kishimoto incorporated the Chinese zodiac tradition which has a significant history in Japan the hand signs used in the series derive from this 6 The design of Konoha was conceived spontaneously drawing from the scenery of Kishimoto's hometown in Okayama 15 The unspecified time period allowed the inclusion of modern elements such as convenience stores though projectile weapons and vehicles were excluded 15 16 Kishimoto's childhood proximity to Hiroshima and his grandfather's wartime accounts influenced his portrayal of conflict He believed that war results from accumulated historical tensions and aimed to depict a nuanced background for the manga's final arc Unlike his grandfather's stories Kishimoto intended the Fourth Great Ninja War to convey a sense of hope 17 The narrative arc involving Naga to established thematic foundations for the ending particularly through Naruto's forgiveness which paralleled his eventual reconciliation with Sasuke 14 The series ' conclusion was delayed due to unspecified issues Upon the release of volume 66 Kishimoto noted he had reached a long awaited narrative moment 18 From the outset Kishimoto planned to conclude with a battle between Naruto and Sasuke though he initially considered their backgrounds asymmetrical Naruto not having experienced war directly unlike Sasuke whose family was killed to prevent civil war 19 Kishimoto selected H in at a Hyuga as Naruto's romantic partner early in the series citing her consistent admiration and respect for him as a foundation for a believable relationship 20 Although romantic subplots were initially considered significant development was reserved for the 2014 film The Last Naruto the Movie for which Kishimoto collaborated with screenwriter Maru o Ky oz uk a 21 22 23 Naruto's relationship with his son Bor u to was further explored in the 2015 film Bor u to Naruto the Movie concluding Naruto's character arc as an adult this was briefly depicted in the manga's finale 24 Written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto Naruto was serialized for a 15 year run in Shueisha's magazine Weekly Sh nen Jump from September 21 1999 25 26 to November 10 2014 27 28 Shueisha collected its chapters in 72 tank

manga as the volume count went over 40 124 Several reviewers commented on Naruto's balance between fight scenes and plot development A E Sparrow of IGN and Casey Brien za of Anime News Network felt that the result was a strong storyline 125 126 but Carl Kimlinger also writing for the same website suggested that there were too many fights which slowed down the plot 127 Kimlinger liked the character designs and approved of the fight scenes themselves 127 which also drew positive comments from Rik Span jer s who felt that the excitement of the scenes depended on Kishimoto's skill in depicting action 127 Javier Lugo writing for Manga Life agreed describing the artwork as dramatic exciting and just right for the story he's telling 128 Brian a Lawrence from Mania Entertainment said the growth of the characters gave Part II an adult feel 129 Writing for IGN Ramsey Is ler called Jutsu one of the most entertaining concepts in Naruto stating as well that their diversity complex signs required for techniques the unique physical features and the sheer destructive power of N in jutsu are the elements that have made the series widely popular 130 In a review of volume 28 Brien za also praised Part II's storyline and characterization though she commented that not every volume reached a high level of quality 125 The fights across Part II received praise most notably Naruto's and Sasuke's resulting in major changes into their character arcs 131 132 133 Meanwhile the final battle between the two characters in the finale earned major praise for the choreography and art provided as well as how in depth the two's personalities were shown in the aftermath However some writers criticized Ka guy a being the least entertaining villain making the showdown between Naruto and Sasuke more appealing as a result The finale earned nearly perfect scores from both Anime News Network and Comic Book Bin with the latter acclaiming the popularity of the title character 134 135 136 Responding to Naruto's success Kishimoto said in Naruto Collector Winter 2007 2008 that he was very glad that the American audience has accepted and understood ninja It shows that the American audience has good taste because it means they can accept something previously unfamiliar to them 137 G It a professor in the manga department of Tokyo Polytechnic University compared the series ' development to the manga of Dragon Ball saying that both manga present good illustrations of three dimensional body movements that successfully capture the characters ' martial arts G felt readers could empathize with the characters in Naruto via their inner monologue during battles 138 The series also influenced the 2010 Scott Pilgrim vs The World with director Edgar Wright saying he was inspired by how whenever there was a killer move in the manga it led to an impact in the background following any technique's usage 139 When the manga ended multiple authors from the magazine expressed congratulations to Kishimoto for his work 140 The fight scenes in general earned acclaim for how well written they were something game developer Cyber Connect 2 took into account when developing the Naruto games 141 142 143 144 Christ el Hoo lans managing director of Kana and Le Lombard called Naruto the first long running series after Dragon Ball to become a classic in France 145 Naruto won the Quill Award for graphic novel in 2006 146 147 In April 2007 volume 14 earned the Viz the Manga Trade Paperback of the Year Gem Award from Diamond Comic Distributors 148 The manga was nominated for Favorite Manga Series in Nickelodeon Magazine's 2009 Comics Awards 149 It won the 16 th Spanish Manga Barcelona award for the shonen category in 2010 150 In 2015 the manga was nominated for the 19 th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize 151 Kishimoto was the winner of Rookie of the Year for the series in the Japanese government's Agency for Cultural Affairs 2014 Minister of Education Culture Sports Science and Technology Fine Arts Recommendation Awards 152 On TV Asahi's Manga S sen kyo 2021 poll in which 150 000 people voted for their top 100 manga series Naruto ranked seventh 153 Amy Plumb argues that Kishimoto's use of references to Japanese mythology in Naruto is intended to add further layers to the story Kishimoto expects his readers to decode the references which allows him to avoid direct explanations One example is Itachi who has three ninja techniques named after Shinto deities Tsuki yomi Amaterasu and Susano o Plumb also cites Sasuke's clan's heraldic symbol a fan known as an uchiwa These fans are used in Japanese myths to exorcise evil by blowing it away Sasuke discovers late in the series that he has the ability to blow away the influence of the Nine Tailed Fox on Naruto Foxes kitsune tsuki are tricksters in Japanese mythology and in some stories they take over human bodies Plumb comments on the obvious similarities to the Nine Tail sealed in Naruto and the pranks Naruto plays 154 Christopher A Born notes that the Naruto storyline contains traditional Confucian values and suggests that students who analyse manga such as Naruto and Bleach will learn more about Confucianism than they would from studying its abstract ideas 155 Norman Mel chor Robles Jr evaluated the portrayal of both positive and negative ideas in Naruto by counting words in the script which were associated with either violence or positive values he found that a small majority of tagged words were violent but commented that the portrayal of violence seemed organized to show how positive strategies on the part of the protagonists could overcome the violence 156 She u o Hui Gan considers the series to have a set of traditional ethical values She also compares the treatment of alienation in Naruto which Naruto overcomes by joining his society to the portrayal of alienation in Akira and Neon Genesis Evangelion where the main characters remain alienated 157 Naruto has been described by several critics as a coming of age story 158 159 160 Psychologist Lawrence C Rubin suggests that the storylines would appeal to readers of any age who have lost loved ones having difficulty finding friends or who are in other situations shown in the series 158 In Yukari Fujimoto's view as the characters mature they show respect to the adults who have raised and taught them making it a conservative storyline in comparison to other manga of the same time period such as One Piece and Air Gear 159 Rik Span jer s sees the difference between Sasuke a loner and Naruto an optimist as tragic arguing that the contrast between the two protagonists ' approach to the world is fundamental to the plot Naruto's strength grows as he gains more loved ones to protect while Sasuke remains alone and is increasingly absorbed by his quest for revenge 160 O mote Tomoyuki points out that there are many humorous moments in the story despite the difficulties Naruto finds himself in but the comedic elements diminish dramatically over time as Naruto grows into a teenager particularly once Part II begins Sh nen Jump began to serialize comedies such as Ginta ma and Reborn from 2003 onwards and in Tomoyuki's view this is part of the reason for the change in emphasis Naruto was not supposed to provide laughter anymore 161 Fujimoto argues that the story contains overly traditional gender roles noting its representations suggest that men are men and women are women and that they differ naturally regarding aptitude and vocation For example the girls initially outperform the boys in the Ninja Academy but once the boys get serious the girls cannot keep pace Fujimoto points out that this does not upset Sakura who is now surpassed by Naruto Character development based on female roles when it does occur again uses stereotypical roles T sun a de for example a middle aged woman with large breasts is a clear mother figure and when she teaches Sakura to be a medical ninja which requires special skills possessed only by women the story reinforces the idea that women only belong on the battlefield as medics T sun a de herself who is a figure of authority in Naruto is portrayed as ridiculous in a way that men in the same position are not Fujimoto suggests this presentation of women may explain why the female characters are often the most disliked characters among readers of the manga 162 Language notes General notes",
