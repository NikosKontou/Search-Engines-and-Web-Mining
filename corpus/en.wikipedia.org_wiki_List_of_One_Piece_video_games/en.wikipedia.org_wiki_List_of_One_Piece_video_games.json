    "transformers_text": "The One Piece video games are based on Eiichiro Oda 's manga and anime series of the same name . Most games are published by Bandai Namco Entertainment , formerly Bandai and Banpresto . The games take place in the fictional world of One Piece , and the stories revolve around the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his Straw Hat Pirates , the franchise's protagonists.\n\nGames have been released for many home video game consoles , handheld game consoles , and mobile phones. The series features various genres, mostly role-playing games (the predominant type in the series' early years) and fighting games , such as the games in the Grand Battle! sub-series. The series contains 56 games including 11 mobile games, not counting appearances in crossover entries.\n\nThe video game series debuted in Japan on July 19, 2000, with From TV Animation – One Piece: Become the Pirate King! (One Piece: Mezase Kaizoku Ou!) for the Bandai WonderSwan Color handheld game console. [ 1 ] More than five years after the video game series debuted in Japan, One Piece: Grand Battle! Rush was the first One Piece video game to be localized and released in North America, on September 7, 2005, for Nintendo GameCube .
