In 2023, India overtook China to become the most populous country in the world. The COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath marked the early 2020s. The first reports of the virus were published on 31 December 2019, though the first cases are said to have appeared nearly a month earlier. The pandemic led to a global economic recession , sustained rise in global inflation , and supply chain crisis . The World Health Organization declared the virus a global state of emergency . With multiple extreme weather events and ecological crises continuing to escalate, several world leaders have called the 2020s the \"decisive decade\" for climate action . The years 2023 and 2024 both broke yearly global temperature records , with 2024 breaching 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels .\n\nGlobal economic inequality skyrocketed. Widespread democratic backsliding continued and many countries' governance shifted from liberal democracy and towards authoritarianism , marking the end of the Post–Cold War era . Far-right extremist and authoritarian politics became prominent in China , South Korea , Israel , Europe , and Russia . Conservative and right-wing populist leaders maintained or returned to power, such as Donald Trump , Benjamin Netanyahu , and Vladimir Putin , while liberal leaders such as Kamala Harris , Keir Starmer , and Volodymyr Zelenskyy were defeated or are struggling.\n\nAnti-government demonstrations and revolts occurred, such as the Gen Z protests including the \" Asian Spring \" in Asian countries, predominantly led by the eponymous Generation Z , in response to inequality , declining standards of living , corruption , democratic backsliding and authoritarianism . Social media has been a common tool for activism and coordination. Protests against responses to COVID-19, against racism and police brutality by the Black Lives Matter movement, and against various forms of governmental jurisdiction, corruption , and authoritarianism occurred; along with citizen riots throughout the United States and Brazil attempting to overturn election results, seen by supporters as stolen, taking place. Among democracies in 2024, its elections saw 80% of incumbent parties lose support worldwide, as with the 2024 United States presidential election . In 2025, Trump triggered a global trade war , marking a new era of economic nationalism and the end of free trade .

The acts, often called the Farm Bills, had been described as \"anti-farmer laws\" by many farmer unions, and politicians from the opposition who said that the three laws would leave farmers at the \"mercy of corporates\" since the farmer-trader disputes were taken to SDM instead of judiciary. The protests demanded the creation of a minimum support price (MSP) bill, to ensure that corporates cannot control the prices. The Union Government , however, maintained that the laws would make it effortless for farmers to sell their produce directly to big buyers, and stated that the protests are based on misinformation. Related endemic legacy issues include farmer suicides and low farmer incomes. Despite India being largely self-sufficient in foodgrain production and having welfare schemes, hunger and nutrition remain serious issues, with India ranking as one of the worst countries in the world in food security parameters. Due to unfulfilled previous demands 2024 Indian farmers' protest started on 13 of February 2024.\n\nSoon after the acts were introduced, unions began holding local protests, mostly in Punjab state. After two months of protests, farmer unions—mainly from Punjab and neighbouring Haryana —began a movement named Dilli Chalo ( transl. Let's go to Delhi ), in which tens of thousands of union members marched towards the nation's capital. The Indian government ordered the police and law enforcement of various states to stop the protesters using water cannons, batons, and tear gas to prevent them entering Haryana and then Delhi . November 2020 saw a nationwide general strike in support of the farmers and thousands converging at various border points on the way to Delhi. Eleven rounds of talks took place between the central government and farmers represented by the farm unions between 14 October 2020 and 22 January 2021; all were inconclusive with agreement on only two relatively minor points. Smaller but richer states of Haryana and Punjab , with large surplus food production, are the massive provider of food security to India as they provide 70-90% of wheat and 28-44% of rice of India's total PDS . Hence, farm reform was considered to be a more sensitive issue in these food surplus states as compared to other net food consumer states with negative food security such as BIMARU states .
