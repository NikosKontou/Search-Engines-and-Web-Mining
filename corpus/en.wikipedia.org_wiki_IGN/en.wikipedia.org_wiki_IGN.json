Daily Radar brand In February 1999 PC Magazine named IGN one of the hundred best websites alongside competitors GameSpot and CNET Game center 3 That same month Imagine Media incorporated a spin off that included IGN and its affiliate channels as Affiliation Networks while Simpson Bint remained at the former company In September the newly spun out standalone internet media company changed its name to Snowball com At the same time small entertainment website The Den merged into IGN and added non gaming content to the growing network Snowball held an IPO in 2000 but shed most of its other properties during the dot com bubble IGN prevailed with growing audience numbers and a newly established subscription service called IGN Insider later IGN Prime which led to the shedding of the name

Gamer Network and its properties in May 2024 for an undisclosed sum These included Eurogamer Rock Paper Shotgun VG 247 and others As a result some layoffs were made due to redundancies 19 A member of the IGN staff writes a review for a game and gives it a score between 0 1 and 10 0 which is assigned by increments of 0 1 and determines how much the game is recommended The score is given according to the individual aspects of a game like presentation graphics sound gameplay and lasting appeal Each game is given a score in each of these categories but the overall score for the game is an independent evaluation not an average of the scores in each category 20 On August 3 2010 IGN announced that the site would be changing to a new scoring scale Instead of a 100 point scale where games are scored in increments of 0 1 all future reviews would use a 20 point scale where games are scored in increments of 0 5 Under both systems the maximum possible score a game can receive is 10 0 The scoring change was not retroactive all scores on reviews written before the change would remain the same This change also did not affect the scoring system for reader reviews On September 13 2012 IGN revealed that as part of its new review format all future reviews would follow a 100 point scale again but without using decimals meaning a score of 8 5 would become an 85 Unlike the previous conversion to the 20 point scale this latest scoring system change was retroactive and all previous IGN review scores were to be updated to follow the new system However despite the announcement the article included a short addition post release it stated that after much discussion they had decided to retain the decimal point in all upcoming scores 21 In early 2014 IGN introduced a new policy in which a game's review score can be re reviewed and improved provided that continuous updates form a significant change compared to the game at launch Examples of games that have been re reviewed were League of Legends Heroes of the Storm War frame and the pocket edition of Minecraft 22 In January 2020 IGN revealed that reviews would be reverted to a 10 point scale from 1 to 10 finding that the finer distinction of the 100 point scale was difficult to maintain whereas a 10 point scale would still be true to its reviews and would be easier to promote 23 IGN's ' Best of ' is an end of year event to annually honor the year's best games films television shows and comics 24 Winners of each award category are selected by IGN staff from a list of nominees while readers are able to cast their own votes online to determine the ' People's Choice ' award for each category In 2000 Snowball com purchased a nE federation called the Internet Wrestling Organization IWO 25 Since Snowball owned both
