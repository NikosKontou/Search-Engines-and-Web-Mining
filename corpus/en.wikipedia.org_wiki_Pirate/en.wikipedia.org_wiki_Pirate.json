    "transformers_text": "Piracy is an act of robbery or criminal violence by ship or boat borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area typically with the goal of stealing cargo and valuable goods or taking hostages Those who conduct acts of piracy are called pirates and vessels used for piracy are called pirate ships The earliest documented instances of piracy were in the 14 th century BC when theSe a Peoples a group of ocean raiders attacked the ships of the Aegean and Mediterranean civilisations Narrow channels which funnel shipping into predictable routes have long created opportunities for piracy 1 as well as for privateer ing and commerce raiding Historic examples of such areas include the waters of Gibraltar the Strait of Malacca Madagascar the Gulf of Aden and the English Channel whose geographic structures facilitated pirate attacks 2 3 The term piracy generally refers to maritime piracy although the term has been generalized to refer to acts committed on land 4 in the air on computer networks and in science fiction outer space Piracy usually excludes crimes committed by the perpetrator on their own vessel e g theft as well as privateer ing which implies authorization by a state government Piracy or pirating is the name of a specific crime under customary international law and also the name of a number of crimes under the municipal law of a number of states In the 21 st century seaborne piracy against transport vessels remains a significant issue with estimated worldwide losses of US 25 billion in 2023 5 increased from US 16 billion in 2004 6 The waters between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean off the Somali coast and in the Strait of Malacca and Singapore have frequently been targeted by modern pirates armed with automatic firearms and occasionally explosive weaponry They often use small motorboats to attack and board ships a tactic that takes advantage of the small number of crew members on modern cargo vessels and transport ships The international community is facing many challenges in bringing modern pirates to justice as these attacks often occur in international waters 7 Nations have used their naval forces to repel and pursue pirates and some private vessels use armed security guards high pressure water cannons or sound cannons to repel boarders and use radar to avoid potential threats Romantic is ed accounts of piracy during the Age of Sail have long been a part of Western pop culture The two volume A General History of the Pyrates published in London in 1724 is generally credited with bringing key piratical figures and a semi accurate description of their milieu in the Golden Age of Piracy to the public's imagination A General History inspired and informed many later fictional depictions of piracy most notably the novels Treasure Island 1883 and Peter Pan 1911 both of which have been adapted and re adapted for stage film television and other media across over a century More recently pirates of the golden age were further stereotyped and popularized by the Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise which began in 2003 The English word pirate is derived from the Latin pirata pirate corsair sea robber which comes from Greek pei rat s brigand 8 from pei r oma i I attempt from pe ra attempt experience 9 The meaning of the Greek word pei rat s literally is anyone who attempts something Over time it came to be used of anyone who engaged in robbery or brigand ry on land or sea 10 The term first appeared in English c 1300 11 Spelling did not become standardised until the eighteenth century and spellings such as pirro t pyr ate and pyr at occurred until this period 12 13 The earliest documented instances of piracy are the exploits of theSe a Peoples who threatened the ships sailing in the Aegean and Mediterranean waters in the 14 th century BC In classical antiquity the Phoenicians Illyrians and Tyrrhenian s were known as pirates In the pre classical era the ancient Greeks condoned piracy as a viable profession it apparently was widespread and regarded as an entirely honourable way of making a living 14 References are made to its perfectly normal occurrence in many texts including in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey and abduction of women and children to be sold into slavery was common By the era of Classical Greece piracy was looked upon as a disgrace to have as a profession 14 15 In the 3 rd century BC pirate attacks on Olympus in Lycia brought impoverishment Among some of the most famous ancient pirate e ring peoples were the Illyrians a people populating the western Balkan peninsula Constantly raiding the Adriatic Sea the Illyrians caused many conflicts with the Roman Republic It was not until 229 BC when the Romans decisively beat the Illyrian fleets that their threat was ended 16 During the 1 st century BC there were pirate states along the Anatolian coast threatening the commerce of the Roman Empire in the eastern Mediterranean On one voyage across the Aegean Sea in 75 BC 17 Julius Caesar was kidnapped and briefly held by Cilicia n pirates and held prisoner in the Dodecanese islet of P harm a cus a 18 The Senate invested the general Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus with powers to deal with piracy in 67 BC the Lex Gabi nia and Pompey after three months of naval warfare managed to suppress the threat As early as 258 AD the Gothic Her uli c fleet ravaged towns on the coasts of the Black Sea and Sea of Marmara The Aegean coast suffered similar attacks a few years later In 264 the Goths reached Galatia and C appa do cia and Gothic pirates landed on Cyprus and Crete In the process the Goths seized enormous booty and took thousands into captivity citation needed In 286 AD Cara us ius a Roman military commander of Gaulish origins was appointed to command the Class is Britannica and given the responsibility of eliminating Frankish and Saxon pirates who had been raiding the coasts of Armorica and Belgic Gaul In the Roman province of Britannia Saint Patrick was captured and enslaved by Irish pirates The most widely recognized and far reaching pirates in medieval Europe were the Vikings 19 seaborne warriors from Scandinavia who raided and looted mainly between the 8 th and 12 th centuries during the Viking Age in the Early Middle Ages They raided the coasts rivers and inland cities of all Western Europe as far as Seville which was attacked by the Norse in 844 Vikings also attacked the coasts of North Africa and Italy and plundered all the coasts of the Baltic Sea Some Vikings ascended the rivers of Eastern Europe as far as the Black Sea and Persia In the Late Middle Ages the Frisian pirates known as Arumer Z warte Hoop led by Pier Gerlofs Donia and Wijerd Jelckama fought against the troops of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V with some success Toward the end of the 9 th century Moorish pirate havens were established along the coast of southern France and northern Italy 20 In 846 Moor raiders sacked the extra muros Basilicas of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in Rome In 911 the bishop of Narbonne was unable to return to France from Rome because the Moors from Fra xi net controlled all the passes in the Alps Moor pirates operated out of the Balearic Islands in the 10 th century From 824 to 961 Arab pirates in the Emirate of Crete raided the entire Mediterranean In the 14 th century raids by Moor pirates forced the Venetian Duke of Crete to ask Venice to keep its fleet on constant guard citation needed After the Slavic invasions of the former Roman province of Dalmatia in the 5 th and 6 th centuries a tribe called the Naren tines revived the old Illyrian piratical habits and often raided the Adriatic Sea starting in the 7 th century Their raids in the Adriatic increased rapidly until the whole Sea was no longer safe for travel The Naren tines took more liberties in their raiding quests while the Venetian Navy was abroad as when it was campaigning in Sicilian waters in 827 882 As soon as the Venetian fleet would return to the Adriatic the Naren tines momentarily outcast their habits again even signing a Treaty in Venice and b apt ising their Slavic pagan leader into Christianity In 834 or 835 they broke the treaty and again they raided Venetian traders returning from Benevento All of Venice's military attempts to punish them in 839 and 840 utterly failed Later they raided the Venetians more often together with the Arabs In 846 the Naren tines broke through to Venice itself and raided its lagoon city of Caorle This caused a Byzantine military action against them that brought Christianity to them After the Arab raids on the Adriatic coast circa 872 and the retreat of the Imperial Navy the Naren tines continued their raids of Venetian waters causing new conflicts with the Italians in 887 888 The Venetians futilely continued to fight them throughout the 10 th and 11 th centuries Dom ago j was accused of attacking a ship which was bringing home the papal legates who had participated in the Eighth Catholic Ecumenical Council after which Pope John VIII addresses to Dom ago j with request that his pirates stop attacking Christians at sea 21 22 In 937 Irish pirates sided with the Scots Vikings Picts and Welsh in their invasion of England Athelstan drove them back The Slavic piracy in the Baltic Sea ended with the Danish conquest of the Rani stronghold of Ark on a in 1168 In the 12 th century the coasts of western Scandinavia were plundered by Cur on ian san dOes eli an s from the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea In the 13 th and 14 th century pirates threatened the Hanseatic routes and nearly brought sea trade to the brink of extinction The Victual Brothers of Gotland were a companionship of privateers who later turned to piracy as the Liked eel ers They were especially noted for their leaders Klaus St rte be ker and G de ke Michel s Until about 1440 maritime trade in both the North Sea the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Bothnia was seriously in danger of attack by the pirates H Thomas Mil horn mentions a certain Englishman named William Maurice convicted of piracy in 1241 as the first person known to have been hanged drawn and quartered 23 which would indicate that the then ruling King Henry III took an especially severe view of this crime The ush kui nik s were Novgorod ian pirates who looted the cities on the Volga and Kama Rivers in the 14 th century As early as Byzantine times the Mani ots one of Greece's toughest populations were known as pirates The Mani ots considered piracy as a legitimate response to the fact that their land was poor and it became their main source of income The main victims of Mani ot pirates were the Ottomans but the Mani ots also targeted ships of European countries Zap ori zhi an Sich was a pirate republic in Europe from the 16 th through to the 18 th century Situated in Cossack territory in the remote steppe of Eastern Europe it was populated with Ukrainian peasants that had run away from their feudal masters outlaws destitute gentry run away slaves from Turkish galleys etc The remoteness of the place and the rapids at the Dnieper river effectively guarded the place from invasions of vengeful powers The main target of the inhabitants of the Zap ori zhi an Sich who called themselves Cossacks were rich settlements at the Black Sea shores of Ottoman Empire and Crimean Khanate citation needed By 1615 and 1625 Zap oro zhi an Cossacks had even managed to raze townships on the outskirts of Istanbul forcing the Ottoman Sultan to flee his palace citation needed Don Cossacks under St enka Raz in even ravaged the Persian coasts 24 unreliable source Though less famous and romanticized than Atlantic or Caribbean pirates corsairs in the Mediterranean equaled or outnumbered the former at any given point in history 25 Mediterranean piracy was conducted almost entirely with galleys until the mid 17 th century when they were gradually replaced with highly maneuverable sailing vessels such as xe be cs and brigantines They were of a smaller type than battle galleys often referred to as gali ots or fu st as 26 Pirate galleys were small nimble lightly armed but often crewed in large numbers in order to overwhelm the often minimal crews of merchant ships In general pirate craft were extremely difficult for patrolling craft to actually hunt down and capture Anne Hilari on de Tourville a French admiral of the 17 th century believed that the only way to run down raiders from the in famous corsair Moroccan port of Sal was by using a captured pirate vessel of the same type 27 Using oared vessels to combat pirates was common and was even practiced by the major powers in the Caribbean Purpose built galleys or hybrid sailing vessels were built by the English in Jamaica in 1683 28 and by the Spanish in the late 16 th century 29 Specially built sailing frigates with oar ports on the lower decks like the James Galley and Charles Galley and oar equipped sloops proved highly useful for pirate hunting though they were not built in sufficient numbers to check piracy until the 1720 s 30 The expansion of Muslim power through the Ottoman conquest of large parts of the eastern Mediterranean in the 15 th and 16 th century resulted in extensive piracy on sea trading The so called Barbary pirates began to operate out of North African ports in Algiers Tunis Tripoli Morocco around 1500 preying primarily on the shipping of Christian powers including massive slave raids at sea as well as on land The Barbary pirates were nominally under Ottoman suzerainty but had considerable independence to prey on the enemies of Islam The Muslim corsairs were technically often privateers with support from legitimate though highly belligerent states They considered themselves as holy Muslim warriors or ghazi s 31 carrying on the tradition of fighting the incursion of Western Christians that had begun with the First Crusade late in the 11 th century 32 Coastal villages and towns of Italy Spain and islands in the Mediterranean were frequently attacked by Muslim corsairs and long stretches of the Italian and Spanish coasts were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants After 1600 the Barbary corsairs occasionally entered the Atlantic and struck as far north as Iceland According to Robert Davis between 1 million and 1 25 million Europeans were captured by Barbary corsairs and sold as slaves in North Africa and the Ottoman Empire between the 16 th and 19 th centuries The most famous corsairs were the Ottoman Albanian Hay redd in and his older brother Or u Reis Red beard Turgut Reis known as Drag ut in the West Kurt og lu known as Cur to goli in the West Kemal Reis S a lih Reis and Ko ca Murat Reis A few Barbary corsairs such as the Dutch Jan Janszoon and the English John Ward Muslim name Yusuf Reis were renegade European privateers who had converted to Islam 33 34 The Barbary pirates had a direct Christian counterpart in the military order of the Knights of Saint John that operated first out of Rhodes and after 1530 Malta though they were less numerous and took fewer slaves Both sides waged war against the respective enemies of their faith and both used galleys as their primary weapons Both sides also used captured or bought galley slaves to man the oars of their ships The Muslims relied mostly on captured Christians the Christians used a mix of Muslim slaves Christian convicts and a small contingency of buona v og lie free men who out of desperation or poverty had taken to rowing 32 Historian Peter Earle has described the two sides of the Christian Muslim Mediterranean conflict as mirror image s of maritime predation two businesslike fleets of plunderers set against each other 35 This conflict of faith in the form of privateer ing piracy and slave raiding generated a complex system that was upheld financed operated on the trade in plunder and slaves that was generated from a low intensive conflict as well as the need for protection from violence The system has been described as a massive multinational protection racket 36 the Christian side of which was not ended until 1798 in the Napoleonic Wars The Barbary corsairs were quelled as late as the 1830 s effectively ending the last vestiges of counter crusading jihad 37 Piracy off the Barbary coast was often assisted by competition among European powers in the 17 th century France encouraged the corsairs against Spain and later Britain and Holland supported them against France By the second half of the 17 th century the greater European naval powers began to initiate reprisals to intimidate the Barbary States into making peace with them The most successful of the Christian states in dealing with the corsair threat was England citation needed From the 1630 s onwards England had signed peace treaties with the Barbary States on various occasions but invariably breaches of these agreements led to renewed wars Albanian piracy mainly centered in the town of Ulcinj thus came to be known as Dulcigno tt i flourished during the 15 th to the 19 th century 38 France which had recently emerged as a leading naval power achieved comparable success soon afterwards with bombardments of Algiers in 1682 1683 and 1688 securing a lasting peace while Tripoli was similarly coerced in 1686 In 1783 and 1784 the Spaniards bombarded Algiers in an effort to stem the piracy The second time Admiral Barcel damaged the city so severely that the Algerian Dey asked Spain to negotiate a peace treaty From then on Spanish vessels and coasts were safe for several years citation needed Until the American Declaration of Independence in 1776 British treaties with the North African states protected American ships from the Barbary corsairs Morocco which in 1777 was the first independent nation to publicly recognize the United States became in 1784 the first Barbary power to seize an American vessel after independence While the United States managed to secure peace treaties these obliged it to pay tribute for protection from attack Payments in ransom and tribute to the Barbary states amounted to 20 of United States government annual expenditures in 1800 39 leading to the Barbary Wars that ended the payment of tribute Algiers broke the 1805 peace treaty after only two years and refused to implement the 1815 treaty until compelled to do so by Britain in 1816 In 1815 the sacking of Palma on the island of Sardinia by a Tunisian squadron which carried off 158 inhabitants roused widespread indignation Britain had by this time banned the slave trade and was seeking to induce other countries to do likewise This led to complaints from states which were still vulnerable to the corsairs that Britain's enthusiasm for ending the trade in African slaves did not extend to stopping the enslavement of Europeans and Americans by the Barbary States In order to neutral is e this objection and further the anti slavery campaign in 1816 Lord Exmouth was sent to secure new concessions from Tripoli Tunis and Algiers including a pledge to treat Christian captives in any future conflict as prisoners of war rather than slaves and the imposition of peace between Algiers and the kingdoms of Sardinia and Sicily On his first visit he negotiated satisfactory treaties and sailed for home While he was negotiating a number of Sardinian fishermen who had settled at Bona on the Tunisian coast were brutally treated without his knowledge As Sardinian s they were technically under British protection and the government sent Exmouth back to secure reparation On August 17 in combination with a Dutch squadron under Admiral Van de Capelle n he bombarded Algiers 40 Both Algiers and Tunis made fresh concessions as a result Securing uniform compliance with a total prohibition of slave raiding which was traditionally of central importance to the North African economy presented difficulties beyond those faced in ending attacks on ships of individual nations which had left slavers able to continue their accustomed way of life by preying on less well protected peoples Algiers renewed its slave raiding though on a smaller scale Measures to be taken against the city's government were discussed at the Congress of Aix la Chapelle in 1818 In 1820 another British fleet under Admiral Sir Harry Neal again bombarded Algiers Corsair activity based in Algiers did not entirely cease until its conquest by France in 1830 40 In thal as socratic Austronesian cultures in Island Southeast Asia maritime raids for slaves and resources against rival polities have ancient origins It was associated with prestige and prowess and often recorded in tattoos Reciprocal raiding traditions were recorded by early European cultures as being prevalent throughout Island Southeast Asia 41 42 43 44 45 With the advent of Islam and the colonial era slaves became a valuable resource for trading with European Arab and Chinese slavers and the volume of piracy and slave raids increased significantly 45 Numerous native peoples engaged in sea raiding they include theIr a nun and Bala ngu ingui slavers of Sulu the I ban headhunters of Borneo the Bugis sailors of South Sulawesi and the Malays of western Southeast Asia Piracy was also practiced by foreign seafarers on a smaller scale including Chinese Japanese and European traders renegades and outlaws 43 The volume of piracy and raids were often dependent on the ebb and flow of trade and monsoons with pirate season known colloquially as the Pirate Wind starting from August to September 42 Slave raids were of high economic importance to the Muslim Sultanates in the Sulu Sea the Sultanate of Sulu the Sultanate of Ma guin dana o and the Confederation of Sultanates in Lana o the modern Moro people It is estimated that from 1770 to 1870 around 200 000 to 300 000 people were enslaved by Iran un and Bangu ingui slavers 41 42 David P Forsythe put the estimate much higher at around 2 million slaves captured within the first two centuries of Spanish rule of the Philippines after 1565 46 These slaves were taken from piracy on passing ships as well as coastal raids on settlements as far as the Malacca Strait Java the southern coast of China and the islands beyond the Makassar Strait Most of the slaves were Tagalog s Visayan s and Malays including Bugis M and are se I ban and Makassar There were also occasional European and Chinese captives who were usually ransomed off through Tau s ug intermediaries of the Sulu Sultanate Slaves were the primary indicators of wealth and status and they were the source of labor for the farms fisheries and workshops of the sultanates While personal slaves were rarely sold they trafficked extensively in slaves purchased from the Iran un and Bangu ingui slave markets By the 1850 s slaves constituted 50 or more of the population of the Sulu archipelago 41 43 42 The scale was so massive that the word for pirate in Malay became la nun a nexon y m of the Iran un people The economy of the Sulu sultanates was largely run by slaves and the slave trade Male captives of the Iran un and the Bangu ingui were treated brutally even fellow Muslim captives were not spared They were usually forced to serve as galley slaves on the la nong and garay warships of their captors Female captives however were usually treated better There were no recorded accounts of rapes though some were starved for discipline Within a year of capture most of the captives of the Iran un and Bangu ingui would be bartered off in Jol o usually for rice opium bolts of cloth iron bars brass ware and weapons The buyers were usually Tau su gda tu from the Sultanate of Sulu who had preferential treatment but buyers also included European Dutch and Portuguese and Chinese traders as well as Visayan pirates re nega dos 42 Spanish authorities and native Christian Filipinos responded to the Moro slave raids by building watchtowers and forts across the Philippine archipelago many of which are still standing today In Northern Luzon particularly in the Pangasinan Ilocos and Cagayan the coastal villages and towns were frequently raided by Moro and Chinese pirates locally known a st rong or cum aw raiders attackers or pirates These pirates looted and burned villages barrios and captured women and children for enslavement To counter these threats Spanish authorities constructed circular adobe watchtowers or bal u artes measuring 6 to 7 meters high These structures built strategically along the coastline using coral blocks bonded with a mixture of lime and egg whites served as both lookout points and defensive fortifications to protect villages from pirate attacks 47 48 49 Some provincial capitals were also moved further inland Major command posts were built in Manila Ca vite Cebu Ilo ilo Zambo an ga and I liga n Defending ships were also built by local communities especially in the Visayas Islands including the construction of war barangay an es bal an gay that were faster than the Moro raiders and could give chase As resistance against raiders increased La nong warships of the Iran un were eventually replaced by the smaller and faster garay warships of the Bangu ingui in the early 19 th century The Moro raids were eventually subdued by several major naval expeditions by the Spanish and local forces from 1848 to 1891 including retaliatory bombardment and capture of Moro settlements By this time the Spanish had also acquired steam gunboats vapor which could easily overtake and destroy the native Moro warships 41 50 51 Several famous pirates such as In tj eh Co hd j a and Was s in grana were hunted by the VOC for hijacking their merchant ships in the Eastern salient of Java 52 Aside from the Iran un and Bangu ingui pirates other polities were also associated with maritime raiding The Bugis sailors of South Sulawesi were in famous as pirates who used to range as far west as Singapore and as far north as the Philippines in search of targets for piracy 53 The Orang la ut pirates controlled shipping in the Straits of Malacca and the waters around Singapore 54 and the Malay and Sea Day ak pirates preyed on maritime shipping in the waters between Singapore and Hong Kong from their haven in Borneo 55 In East Asia by the ninth century populations centered mostly around merchant activities in coastal Shandong and Jiangsu Wealthy benefactors including Chang Pogo established Silla Buddhist temples in the region Chang Pogo had become incensed at the treatment of his fellow countrymen who in the unstable milieu of late Tang often fell victim to coastal pirates or inland bandits After returning to Silla around 825 and in possession of a formidable private fleet headquartered at Cheong hae Wan do Chang Pogo petitioned the Silla king Heung de ok r 826 836 to establish a permanent maritime garrison to protect Silla merchant activities in the Yellow Sea Heung de ok agreed and in 828 formally established the Cheong hae clear sea Garrison at what is today Wan do island off Korea's South Jeolla province Heung de ok gave Chang an army of 10 000 men to establish and man the defensive works The remnants of Cheong hae Garrison can still be seen on Jang islet just off Wan do's southern coast Chang's force though nominally bequeathed by the Silla king was effectively under his own control Chang became arbiter of Yellow Sea commerce and navigation 56 From the 13 th century Wok ou based in Japan made their debut in East Asia initiating invasions that would persist for 300 years The wok ou raids peaked in the 1550 s but by then the wok ou were mostly Chinese smugglers who reacted strongly against the Ming dynasty's strict prohibition on private sea trade During the Qing period Chinese pirate fleets grew increasingly large The effects large scale piracy had on the Chinese economy were immense They preyed voraciously on China's junk trade which flourished in Fujian and Guangdong and was a vital artery of Chinese commerce Pirate fleets exercised hegemony over villages on the coast collecting revenue by exacting tribute and running extortion rackets In 1802 the menacing Zheng Yi inherited the fleet of his cousin captain Zheng Qi whose death provided Zheng Yi with considerably more influence in the world of piracy Zheng Yi and his wife Zheng Yi Sao who would eventually inherit the leadership of his pirate confederacy then formed a pirate coalition that by 1804 consisted of over ten thousand men Their military might alone was sufficient to combat the Qing navy However a combination of famine Qing naval opposition and internal rifts crippled piracy in China around the 1820 s and it has never again reached the same status In the 1840 s and 1850 s United States Navy and Royal Navy forces campaigned together against Chinese pirates Major battles were fought such as those atTy ho Bay and the Tonkin River though pirate junks continued operating off China for years more However some British and American individual citizens also volunteered to serve with Chinese pirates to fight against European forces The British offered rewards for the capture of westerners serving with Chinese pirates During the Second Opium War and the Taiping Rebellion piratical junks were again destroyed in large numbers by British naval forces but ultimately it was not until the 1860 s and 1870 s that fleets of pirate junks ceased to exist Chinese Pirates also plagued the Tonkin Gulf area 57 58 Pirates in theM in gera tended to come from populations on the geographic periphery of the state 59 They were recruited largely from the lower classes of society including poor fishermen and many were fleeing from obligatory labor on state building projects organized by the dynasty These lower class men and sometimes women may have fled taxation or conscription by the state in the search of better opportunities and wealth and willingly joined local pirate bands 60 61 These local lower class individuals seem to have felt unrepresented and traded the small amount of security afforded them from their allegiance to the state for the promise of a relatively improved existence engaging in smuggling or other illegal trade Originally pirates in the coastal areas near Fujian and Zhejiang may have been Japanese suggested by the Ming government referring to them as wok ou but it is probable that piracy was a multi ethnic profession by the 16 th century although coastal brigands continued to be referred to as wok ou in many government documents 62 Most pirates were probably Han Chinese but Japanese and even Europeans engaged in pirate activities in the region 63 Pirates engaged in a number of different schemes to make a living Smuggling and illegal trade overseas were major sources of revenue for pirate bands both large and small 64 As the Ming government mostly outlawed private trade overseas at least until the overseas silver trade contributed to a lifting of the ban pirates basically could almost by default control the market for any number of foreign goods 64 65 66 The geography of the coastline made chasing pirates quite difficult for the authorities and private overseas trade began to transform coastal societies by the 15 th century as nearly all aspects of the local society benefitted from or associated with illegal trade 67 The desire to trade for silver eventually led to open conflict between the Ming and illegal smugglers and pirates This conflict along with local merchants in southern China helped persuade the Ming court to end the hai j in ban on private international trade in 1567 66 Pirates also projected local political authority 68 Larger pirate bands could act as local governing bodies for coastal communities collecting taxes and engaging in protection schemes In addition to illegal goods pirates ostensibly offered security to communities on land in exchange for a tax 69 These bands also wrote and codified laws that redistributed wealth punished crimes and provided protection for the taxed community 68 These laws were strictly followed by the pirates as well 70 The political structures tended to look similar to the Ming structures 70 Pirates did not tend to stay pirates permanently It seems to have been relatively easy both to join and leave a pirate band and these raiding groups were more interested in maintaining a willing force 71 Members of these pirate groups did not tend to stay longer than a few months or years at a time 71 There appears to have been a hierarchy in most pirate organizations Pirate leaders could become very wealthy and powerful especially when working with the Chinese dynasty and consequently so could those who served under them 69 These pirate groups were organized similarly to other escape societies throughout history and maintained a re distributive system to reward looting the pirates directly responsible for looting or pillaging got their cut first and the rest was allocated to the rest of the pirate community 69 There seems to be evidence that there was an egalitarian aspect to these communities with capability to do the job being rewarded explicitly The pirates themselves had some special privileges under the law when they interacted with communities on land mostly in the form of extra allotments of redistributed wealth 69 Pirates of course had to sell their loot They had trading relationships with land communities and foreign traders in the southeastern regions of China Zhu Wan who held the office of Grand Coordinator for Coastal Defense documented that pirates in the region to which he had been sent had the support of the local elite gentry class 72 These pirates in gowns and caps directly or indirectly sponsored pirate activity and certainly directly benefitted from the illegal private trade in the region When Zhu Wan or other officials from the capital attempted to eliminate the pirate problem these local elites fought back having Zhu Wan demoted and eventually even sent back to Beijing to possibly be executed 73 The gentry who benefitted from illegal maritime trade were too powerful and influential and they were clearly very invested in the smuggling activities of the pirate community 74 In addition to their relationship with the local elite class on the coast pirates also had complicated and often friendly relationships and partnerships with the dynasty itself as well as with international traders 75 When pirate groups recognized the authority of the dynasty they would often be allowed to operate freely and even profit from the relationship There were also opportunities for these pirates to ally themselves with colonial projects from Europe or other overseas powers 76 Both the dynasty and foreign colonial projects would employ pirates as mercenaries to establish dominance in the coastal region 77 Because of how difficult it was for established state powers to control these regions pirates seem to have had a lot of freedom to choose their allies and their preferred markets 78 Included in this list of possible allies sea marauders and pirates even found opportunities to bribe military officials as they engaged in illegal trade 79 They seem to have been in centi viz ed mostly by money and loot and so could afford to play the field with regards to their political or military allies Because pirate organizations could be so powerful locally the Ming government made concerted efforts to weaken them The presence of colonial projects complicated this however as pirates could ally themselves with other maritime powers or local elites to stay in business The Chinese government was clearly aware of the power of some of these pirate groups as some documents even refer to them as sea rebels a reference to the political nature of pirates 76 Pirates like Zheng Zhi long and Zheng Chenggong accrued tremendous local power eventually even being hired as naval commanders by the Chinese dynasties and foreign maritime powers 80 Ba war ij were Sindhi pirates named for their distinctive bar j a warships 81 who were active between 251 and 865 AD 82 Their frequent piracy and the incident in which they looted two treasure ships coming from Ceylon became the c asus belli for the Umayyad conquest of Sindh 83 Pirates who accepted the Royal Pardon from the Chola Empire would get to serve in the Chola Navy as K all a rani They would be used as coast guards or sent on recon missions to deal with Arab piracy in the Arabian Sea Their function is similar to the 18 th century privateers used by the Royal Navy Starting in the 14 th century the Deccan Southern Peninsular region of India was divided into two entities on the one side stood the Muslim Bah mani Sultanate and on the other stood the Hindu kings rallied around the Vijayanagara Empire Continuous wars demanded frequent resupplies of fresh horses which were imported through sea routes from Persia and Africa This trade was subjected to frequent raids by thriving bands of pirates based in the coastal cities of Western India One of such was Timo ji who operated off Anja dip Island both as a privateer by seizing horse traders that he rendered to the raja of Hon avar and as a pirate who attacked the Kerala merchant fleets that traded pepper with Gujarat During the 16 th and 17 th centuries there was frequent European piracy against Mughal Indian merchants especially those en route to Mecca for Hajj The situation came to a head when the Portuguese attacked and captured the vessel Rahim i which belonged to Mariam Zamani the Mughal queen which led to the Mughal seizure of the Portuguese town Daman 84 In the 18 th century the famous Maratha privateer Kan hoji An gre ruled the seas between Mumbai and Go a 85 The Marathas attacked British shipping and insisted that East India Company ships pay taxes if sailing through their waters 86 The southern coast of the Persian Gulf was known to the British from the late 18 th century as the Pirate Coast where control of the seaways of the Persian Gulf was asserted by the Qa was im Al Qasim i and other local maritime powers Memories of the privations carried out on the coast by Portuguese raiders under Albuquerque were long and local powers antipathetic as a consequence to Christian powers asserting dominance of their coastal waters 87 Early British expeditions to protect the Imperial Indian Ocean trade from competitors principally the Al Qasim i from Ras Al Khaimah and Ling eh led to campaigns against those headquarters and other harbours along the coast in 1809 and then after a relapse in raiding again in 1819 88 This led to the signing of the first formal treaty of maritime peace between the British and the rulers of several coastal sheikhdoms in 1820 This was cemented by the Treaty of Maritime Peace in Perpetuity in 1853 resulting in the British label for the area ' Pirate Coast ' being softened to the ' Trucial Coast ' with several emirates being recognised by the British as Trucial States 87 At one point there were nearly 1 000 pirates located in Madagascar 89 le Sainte Marie was a popular base for pirates throughout the 17 th and 18 th centuries The most famous pirate utopia is that of the probably fictional Captain Misson and his pirate crew who allegedly founded the free colony of Libert at iain northern Madagascar in the late 17 th century until it was destroyed in a surprise attack by the island natives in 1694 90 The classic era of piracy in the Caribbean lasted from circa 1650 until the mid 1720 s 91 By 1650 France England and the United Provinces began to develop their colonial empires This involved considerable seaborne trade and a general economic improvement there was money to be made or stolen and much of it traveled by ship French buccaneers were established on northwestern part of Hispaniola after the devastation s of Osorio as early as 1625 92 but lived at first mostly as hunters rather than robbers their transition to full time piracy was gradual and motivated in part by Spanish efforts to wipe out both the buccaneers and the prey animals on which they depended The buccaneers ' migration from Hispaniola's mainland to the more defensible offshore island of Tortuga limited their resources and accelerated their piratical raids According to Alexandre Ex quem elin a buccaneer and historian who remains a major source on this period the Tortuga buccaneer Pierre Le Grand pioneered the settlers ' attacks on galleons making the return voyage to Spain The growth of buccaneering on Tortuga was augmented by the English capture of Jamaica from Spain in 1655 The early English governors of Jamaica freely granted letters of marque to Tortuga buccaneers and to their own countrymen while the growth of Port Royal provided these raiders with a far more profitable and enjoyable place to sell their booty In the 1660 s the new French governor of Tortuga Bertrand d ' O ger on similarly provided privateer ing commissions both to his own colonists and to English cutthroats from Port Royal These conditions brought Caribbean buccaneering to its zenith A new phase of piracy began in the 1690 s as English pirates began to look beyond the Caribbean for treasure The fall of Britain's Stuart kings had restored the traditional enmity between Britain and France thus ending the profitable collaboration between English Jamaica and French Tortuga The devastation of Port Royal by an earthquake in 1692 further reduced the Caribbean's attractions by destroying the pirates ' chief market for fenced plunder 93 Caribbean colonial governors began to discard the traditional policy of no peace beyond the Line under which it was understood that war would continue and thus letters of marque would be granted in the Caribbean regardless of peace treaties signed in Europe henceforth commissions would be granted only in wartime and their limitations would be strictly enforced Furthermore much of the Spanish Main had simply been exhausted Maracaibo alone had been sacked three times between 1667 and 1678 94 while R o de la H acha had been raided five times and To l eight 95 At the same time England's less favored colonies including Bermuda New York and Rhode Island had become cash starved by the Navigation Acts which restricted trade with foreign ships Merchants and governors eager for coin were willing to overlook and even underwrite pirate voyages one colonial official defended a pirate because he thought it very harsh to hang people that brings in gold to these provinces 96 Although some of these pirates operating out of New England and the Middle Colonies targeted Spain's remoter Pacific coast colonies well into the 1690 s and beyond the Indian Ocean was a richer and more tempting target India's economic output was large during this time especially in high value luxury goods like silk and calico which made ideal pirate booty 97 at the same time no powerful navies plied the Indian Ocean leaving both local shipping and the various East India companies ' vessels vulnerable to attack This set the stage for the famous pirates Thomas Te w Henry Every Robert Cull i ford and although his guilt remains controversial William Kidd In 1713 and 1714 a series of peace treaties ended the War of the Spanish Succession As a result thousands of seamen including European privateers who had operated in the West Indies were relieved of military duty at a time when cross Atlantic colonial shipping trade was beginning to boom In addition European sailors who had been pushed by unemployment to work onboard merchantmen including slave ships were often enthusiastic to abandon that profession and turn to pirating giving pirate captains a steady pool of recruits from various coasts across the Atlantic 98 In 1715 pirates launched a major raid on Spanish divers trying to recover gold from a sunken treasure galleon near Florida The nucleus of the pirate force was a group of English ex privateers all of whom would soon be enshrined in infamy Henry Jennings Charles Vane Samuel Bellamy and Edward England The attack was successful but contrary to their expectations the governor of Jamaica refused to allow Jennings and their cohorts to spend their loot on his island With Kingston and the declining Port Royal closed to them Jennings and his comrades founded a new pirate base at Nassau on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas which had been abandoned during the war Until the arrival of governor Wood es Rogers three years later Nassau would be home for these pirates and their many recruits Shipping traffic between Africa the Caribbean and Europe began to soar in the 18 th century a model that was known as triangular trade and was a rich target for piracy Trade ships sailed from Europe to the African coast trading manufactured goods and weapons in exchange for slaves The traders would then sail to the Caribbean to sell the slaves and return to Europe with goods such as sugar tobacco and cocoa Another triangular trade saw ships carry raw materials preserved cod and rum to Europe where a portion of the cargo would be sold for manufactured goods which along with the remainder of the original load were transported to the Caribbean where they were exchanged for sugar and molasses which with some manufactured articles were borne to New England Ships in the triangular trade made money at each stop 99 As part of the peace settlement of the War of the Spanish succession Britain obtained the a sien to a Spanish government contract to supply slaves to Spain's new world colonies providing British traders and smugglers more access to the traditionally closed Spanish markets in America This arrangement also contributed heavily to the spread of piracy across the western Atlantic at this time Shipping to the colonies boomed simultaneously with the flood of skilled mariners after the war Merchant shippers used the surplus of sailors ' labor to drive wages down cutting corners to maximize their profits and creating unsavory conditions aboard their vessels Merchant sailors suffered from mortality rates as high or higher than the slaves being transported Redi ker 2004 Living conditions were so poor that many sailors began to prefer a freer existence as a pirate The increased volume of shipping traffic also could sustain a large body of brigands preying upon it Among the most in famous Caribbean pirates of the time were Edward Teach or Blackbeard John Rackham and Bartholomew Roberts Most of these pirates were eventually hunted down by the Royal Navy and killed or captured several battles were fought between the brigands and the colonial powers on both land and sea Piracy in the Caribbean declined for the next several decades after 1730 but by the 1810 s many pirates roamed the waters though they were not as bold or successful as their predecessors The most successful pirates of the era were Jean La fit te and Roberto C of res i La fit te is considered by many to be the last buccaneer due to his army of pirates and fleet of pirate ships which held bases in and around the Gulf of Mexico La fit te and his men participated in the War of 1812 battle of New Orleans C of res i's base was in Mona Island Puerto Rico from where he disrupted the commerce throughout the region He became the last major target of the international anti piracy operations 100 The elimination of piracy from European waters expanded to the Caribbean in the 18 th century West Africa and North America by the 1710 s and by the 1720 s even the Indian Ocean was a difficult location for pirates to operate England began to strongly turn against piracy at the turn of the 18 th century as it was increasingly damaging to the country's economic and commercial prospects in the region The Piracy Act 1698 for the more effectual suppression of Piracy 101 made it easier to capture try and convict pirates by lawfully enabling acts of piracy to be examined inquired of tried heard and determined and adjudged in any place at sea or upon the land in any of his Majesty's islands plantations colonies dominions forts or factories This effectively enabled admirals to hold a court session to hear the trials of pirates in any place they deemed necessary rather than requiring that the trial be held in England Commissioners of these vice admiralty courts were also vested with full power and authority to issue warrants summon the necessary witnesses and to do all thing necessary for the hearing and final determination of any case of piracy robbery or felony These new and faster trials provided no legal representation for the pirates and ultimately led in this era to the execution of 600 pirates which represented approximately 10 percent of the pirates active at the time in the Caribbean region 102 Being an accessory to piracy was also criminal is ed under the statute Piracy saw a brief resurgence between the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713 and around 1720 as many unemployed seafarers took to piracy as a way to make ends meet when a surplus of sailors after the war led to a decline in wages and working conditions At the same time one of the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht that ended the war gave to Great Britain's Royal African Company and other British slavers a thirty year a sien to or contract to furnish African slaves to the Spanish colonies providing British merchants and smugglers potential inroads into the traditionally closed Spanish markets in America and leading to an economic revival for the whole region This revived Caribbean trade provided rich new pickings for a wave of piracy Also contributing to the increase of Caribbean piracy at this time was Spain's breakup of the English log wood settlement at Campeche and the attractions of a freshly sunken silver fleet off the southern Bahamas in 1715 Fears over the rising levels of crime and piracy political discontent concern over crowd behaviour at public punishments and an increased determination by Parliament to suppress piracy resulted in the Piracy Act 1717 and Piracy Act 1721 These established a seven year penal transportation to North America as a possible punishment for those convicted of lesser felonies or as a possible sentence that capital punishment might be commuted to by royal pardon In 1717 a pardon was offered to pirates who surrendered to British authorities After 1720 piracy in the classic sense became extremely rare as increasingly effective anti piracy measures were taken by the Royal Navy making it impossible for any pirate to pursue an effective career for long By 1718 the British Royal Navy had approximately 124 vessels and 214 by 1815 a big increase from the two vessels England had possessed in 1670 102 British Royal Navy warships tirelessly hunted down pirate vessels and almost always won these engagements Many pirates did not surrender and were killed at the point of capture notorious pirate Edward Teach or Blackbeard was hunted down by Lieutenant Robert Maynard at Ocracoke Inlet off the coast of North Carolina on November 22 1718 and killed His flagship was a captured French slave ship known originally as La Concorde he renamed the frigate Queen Anne's Revenge Captain Cha loner Ogle of HMS Swallow cornered Bartholomew Roberts in 1722 at Cape Lopez and a fatal broadside from the Swallow killed the pirate captain instantly Roberts ' death shocked the pirate world as well as the Royal Navy The local merchants and civilians had thought him invincible and some considered him a hero 103 Roberts ' death was seen by many historians as the end of the Golden Age of Piracy Also crucial to the end of this era of piracy was the loss of the pirates ' last Caribbean safe haven at Nassau In the early 19 th century piracy along the East and Gulf Coasts of North America as well as in the Caribbean increased again Jean La fit te was just one of hundreds of pirates operating in American and Caribbean waters between the years of 1820 and 1835 The United States Navy repeatedly engaged pirates in the Caribbean Gulf of Mexico and in the Mediterranean C of res 's El Mosquito was disabled in a collaboration between Spain and the United States After fleeing for hours he was ambushed and captured inland The United States landed shore parties on several islands in the Caribbean in pursuit of pirates Cuba was a major haven By the 1830 s piracy had died out again and the navies of the region focused on the slave trade About the time of the Mexican American War in 1846 the United States Navy had grown strong and numerous enough to eliminate the pirate threat in the West Indies By the 1830 s ships had begun to convert to steam propulsion so the Age of Sail and the classical idea of pirates in the Caribbean ended Privateer ing similar to piracy continued as an asset in war for a few more decades and proved to be of some importance during the naval campaigns of the American Civil War Privateer ing would remain a tool of European states until the mid 19 th century's Declaration of Paris But letters of marque were given out much more sparingly by governments and were terminated as soon as conflicts ended The idea of no peace beyond the Line was a relic that had no meaning by the more settled late 18 th and early 19 th centuries Due to the strategic situation of this Spanish archipelago as a crossroads of maritime routes and commercial bridge between Europe Africa and America 104 this was one of the places on the planet with the greatest pirate presence In the Canary Islands the following stand out the attacks and continuous looting of Berber English French and Dutch corsairs sometimes successful and often a failure 104 and on the other hand the presence of pirates and corsairs from this archipelago who made their incursions into the Caribbean Pirates and corsairs such as Fran ois Le Clerc Jacques de Sores Francis Drake defeat in Gran Canaria 105 Pieter van der Does Murat Reis and Hora cio Nelson attacked the islands and was defeated in the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife 1797 106 Among those born in the archipelago stands out above all Amaro Par go whom the monarch Felipe V of Spain frequently benefited in his commercial incursions and corsairs 107 108 Santa Cruz de Tenerife was especially during the first half of the 18 th century the most important corsair center in theM a car ones ian region 109 110 The recent discovery of abundant documentary evidence of significant corsair activity carried out primarily by natives residents and those living on the island confirms this fact At the same time the numerous pirate ships that frequented the Canary Islands waters used landing places along its coast Such was the case of Valle de Salazar or San Andr s which had acquired a reputation as a pirate port until the construction of its castle or defensive tower 111 Piracy on the east coast of North America first became common in the early seventeenth century as English privateers discharged after the end of the Anglo Spanish War 1585 1604 turned to piracy 112 113 The most famous and successful of these early pirates was Peter Easton River piracy in late 18 th mid 19 th century America was primarily concentrated along the Ohio River and Mississippi River valleys In 1803 at Tower Rock the U S Army dragoons possibly from the frontier army post up river at Fort K ask as kia on the Illinois side opposite St Louis raided and drove out the river pirates Stack Island was also associated with river pirates and counterfeiters in the late 1790 s In 1809 the last major river pirate activity took place on the Upper Mississippi River and river piracy in this area came to an abrupt end when a group of flatboat men raided the island wiping out the river pirates From 1790 to 1834 Cave In Rock was the principal outlaw lair and headquarters of river pirate activity in the Ohio River region from which Samuel Mason led a gang of river pirates on the Ohio River River piracy continued on the lower Mississippi River from the early 1800 s to the mid 1830 s declining as a result of direct military action and local law enforcement and regulator vigilante groups that uprooted and swept out pockets of outlaw resistance Roaring Dan Sea vey was a pirate active in the early 1900 s in the Great Lakes region who joined the United States Marshals Service in later life working to curb poaching smuggling and piracy on Lake Michigan 114 Pirates had a system of hierarchy on board their ships determining how captured money was distributed However pirates were more egalitarian than any other area of employment at the time In fact pirate quartermasters were a counterbalance to the captain and had the power to veto his orders The majority of plunder was in the form of cargo and ship's equipment with medicines the most highly prized A vessel's doctor's chest would be worth anywhere from 300 to 400 or around 470 000 in today's values Jewels were common plunder but not popular as they were hard to sell and pirates unlike the public of today had little concept of their value There is one case recorded where a pirate was given a large diamond worth a great deal more than the value of the handful of small diamonds given to his crew mates as a share He felt cheated and had it broken up to match what they received 115 Spanish pieces of eight minted in Mexico or Seville were the standard trade currency in the American colonies However every colony still used the monetary units of pounds shillings and pence for bookkeeping while Spanish German French and Portuguese money were all standard mediums of exchange as British law prohibited the export of British silver coinage Until the exchange rates were standardised in the late 18 th century each colony legislated its own different exchange rates In England 1 piece of eight was worth 4 s 3 d while it was worth 8 s in New York 7 s 6 d in Pennsylvania and 6 s 8 d in Virginia One 18 th century English shilling was worth around 58 in modern currency so a piece of eight could be worth anywhere from 246 to 465 As such the value of pirate plunder could vary considerably depending on who recorded it and where 116 117 Ordinary seamen received a part of the plunder at the captain's discretion but usually a single share On average a pirate could expect the equivalent of a year's wages as his share from each ship captured while the crew of the most successful pirates would often each receive a share valued at around 1 000 1 17 million at least once in their career 115 One of the larger amounts taken from a single ship was that by captain Thomas Te w from an Indian merchantman in 1692 Each ordinary seaman on his ship received a share worth 3 000 3 5 million with officers receiving proportionally larger amounts as per the agreed shares with Te w himself receiving 2 shares It is known there were actions with multiple ships captured where a single share was worth almost double this 115 118 By contrast an ordinary seamen in the Royal Navy received 19 s per month to be paid in a lump sum at the end of a tour of duty which was around half the rate paid in the Merchant Navy However corrupt officers would often tax their crews ' wage to supplement their own and the Royal Navy of the day was in famous for its reluctance to pay From this wage 6 d per month was deducted for the maintenance of Greenwich Hospital with similar amounts deducted for the Chatham Chest the chaplain and surgeon Six months ' pay was withheld to discourage desertion That this was insufficient incentive is revealed in a report on proposed changes to the RN Admiral Nelson wrote in 1803 he noted that since 1793 more than 42 000 sailors had deserted Roughly half of all RN crews were press ganged and these not only received lower wages than volunteers but were shackled while the vessel was docked and were never permitted to go ashore until released from service 119 Although the Royal Navy suffered from many morale issues it answered the question of prize money via the C ruiz ers and Convoys Act 1708 which handed over the share previously gained by the Crown to the captors of the ship Technically it was still possible for the Crown to get the money or a portion of it but this rarely happened The process of condemnation of a captured vessel and its cargo and men was given to the High Court of the Admiralty and this was the process which remained in force with minor changes throughout the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars Even the flag officer's share was not quite straightforward he would only get the full one eighth if he had no junior flag officer beneath him If this was the case then he would get a third share If he had more than one then he would take one half while the rest was shared out equally There was a great deal of money to be made in this way The record breaker was the capture of the Spanish frigate Hermione which was carrying treasure in 1762 The value of this was so great that each individual seaman netted 485 1 4 million in 2008 dollars 120 The two captains responsible Evans and P own all received 65 000 each 188 4 million In January 1807 the frigate Caroline took the Spanish San Rafael which brought in 52 000 for her captain Peter Rainier who had been only a midshipman some thirteen months before All through the wars there are examples of this kind of luck falling on captains Another famous ' capture ' was that of the Spanish frigates Thetis and Santa Brig ada which were loaded with gold specie They were taken by four British frigates who shared the money each captain receiving 40 730 Each lieutenant got 5 091 the Warrant Officer group 2 468 the midshipmen 791 and the individual seamen 182 It should also be noted that it was usually only the frigates which took prizes the ships of the line were far too ponderous to be able to chase and capture the smaller ships which generally carried treasure Nelson always bemoaned that he had done badly out of prize money and even as a flag officer received little This was not that he had a bad command of captains but rather that British mastery of the seas was so complete that few enemy ships dared to sail 121 Even though pirates raided many ships few if any buried their treasure Often the treasure that was stolen was food water alcohol weapons or clothing Other things they stole were household items like bits of soap and gear like rope and anchors or sometimes they would keep the ship they captured either to sell off or keep because it was better than their ship Such items were likely to be needed immediately rather than saved for future trade For this reason there was no need for the pirates to bury these goods Pirates tended to kill few people aboard the ships they captured usually they would kill no one if the ship surrendered because if it became known that pirates took no prisoners their victims would fight to the last breath and make victory both very difficult and costly in lives In contrast ships would quickly surrender if they knew they would be spared In one well documented case 300 heavily armed soldiers on a ship attacked by Thomas Te w surrendered after a brief battle with none of Te w's 40 man crew being injured 122 During the 17 th and 18 th centuries once pirates were caught justice was meted out in a summary fashion and many ended their lives by dancing the hempen jig a euphemism for hanging Public execution was a form of entertainment at the time and people came out to watch them as they would to a sporting event today Newspapers reported details such as condemned men's last words the prayers said by the priests and descriptions of their final moments in the gallows In England most of these executions took place at Execution Dock on the River Thames in London In the cases of more famous prisoners usually captains their punishments extended beyond death Their bodies were enclosed in iron cages gibbet for which they were measured before their execution and left to swing in the air until the flesh rotted off them a process that could take as long as two years The bodies of captains such as William Captain Kidd Charles Vane William Fly and John Rackham were all treated this manner 123 While piracy was predominantly a male occupation throughout history a minority of pirates were female 124 Pirates did not allow women on to their ships very often Additionally women were often regarded as bad luck among pirates It was feared that the male members of the crew would argue and fight over the women On many ships women as well as young boys were prohibited by the ship's contract which all crew members were required to sign 125 303 Only four female pirates are known to have been active during the Golden Age of Piracy They were Anne Bonny and Mary Read women who served under John Rackham in 1720 Mary Crit che ttan escaped prisoner in 1729 and Martha Farley the wife of a minor pirate in 1727 Unlike traditional Western societies of the time many Caribbean pirate crews of European descent operated as limited democracies Pirate communities were some of the first to in state a system of checks and balances similar to the one used by the present day democracies The first record of such a government aboard a pirate sloop dates to the 17 th century 126 As recorded by Captain Charles Johnson regarding the articles of Bartholomew Roberts To date the following identifiable pirate shipwrecks have been discovered A privateer or corsair used similar methods to a pirate but acted under orders of the state while in possession of a commission or letter of marque and reprisal from a government or monarch authorizing the capture of merchant ships belonging to an enemy nation For example the United States Constitution of 1787 specifically authorized Congress to issue letters of marque and reprisal The letter of marque and reprisal was recognized by international convention and meant that a privateer could not technically be charged with piracy while attacking the targets named in his commission This nicety of law did not always save the individuals concerned however since whether one was considered a pirate or a legally operating privateer often depended on whose custody the individual found himself in that of the country that had issued the commission or that of the object of attack Spanish authorities were known to execute foreign privateers with their letters of marque hung around their necks to emphasize Spain's rejection of such defenses Furthermore many privateers exceeded the bounds of their letters of marque by attacking nations with which their sovereign was at peace Thomas Te w and William Kidd are notable alleged examples and thus made themselves liable to conviction for piracy However a letter of marque did provide some cover for such pirates as plunder seized from neutral or friendly shipping could be passed off later as taken from enemy merchants The famous Barbary corsairs of the Mediterranean authorized by the Ottoman Empire were privateers as were the Maltese corsairs who were authorized by the Knights of St John and the Dunkirk ers in the service of the Spanish Empire In the years 1626 1634 alone the Dunkirk privateers captured 1 499 ships and sank another 336 138 From 1609 to 1616 England lost 466 merchant ships to Barbary pirates and 160 British ships were captured by Algerian s between 1677 and 1680 139 One famous privateer was Sir Francis Drake His patron was Queen Elizabeth I and their relationship ultimately proved to be quite profitable for England 140 Privateers constituted a large proportion of the total military force at sea during the 17 th and 18 th centuries During the Nine Years War the French adopted a policy of strongly encouraging privateers French corsairs including the famous Jean Bart to attack English and Dutch shipping England lost roughly 4 000 merchant ships during the war 141 In the following War of Spanish Succession privateer attacks continued Britain losing 3 250 merchant ships 142 During the War of Austrian Succession Britain lost 3 238 merchant ships and France lost 3 434 merchant ships to the British 141 During King George's War approximately 36 000 Americans served aboard privateers at one time or another 141 During the American Revolution about 55 000 American seamen served aboard the privateers 143 The American privateers had almost 1 700 ships and they captured 2 283 enemy ships citation needed Between the end of the Revolutionary War and 1812 less than 30 years Britain France Naples the Barbary states Spain and the Netherlands seized approximately 2 500 American ships 144 Payments in ransom and tribute to the Barbary states amounted to 20 of United States government annual revenues in 1800 145 Throughout the American Civil War Confederate privateers successfully harassed Union merchant ships 146 Privateer ing lost international sanction under the Declaration of Paris in 1856 A wartime activity similar to piracy involves disguised warships called commerce raiders 147 or merchant raiders which attack enemy shipping commerce approaching by stealth and then opening fire Commerce raiders operated successfully during the American Revolution citation needed During the American Civil War the Confederacy sent out several commerce raiders the most famous of which was the CSS Alabama citation needed During World War I and World War II Germany also made use of these tactics both in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans Since commissioned naval vessels were openly used these commerce raiders should not be considered even privateers much less pirates although the opposing combatants were vocal in denouncing them as such Seaborne piracy against transport vessels is a significant issue with estimated worldwide losses of US 16 billion per year in 2004 6 increased to US 25 billion over the next 20 years 5 Waters between the Red Sea and Indian Ocean off the Somali coast and also in the Strait of Malacca and Singapore which are used by over 50 000 commercial ships a year In the Gulf of Guinea maritime piracy has also led to pressure on offshore oil and gas production providing security for offshore installations and supply vessels is often paid for by oil companies rather than the respective governments 148 In the late 2000 s 149 the emergence of piracy off the coast of Somalia spurred a multi national effort led by the United States to patrol the waters near the Horn of Africa In 2011 Brazil also created an anti piracy unit on the Amazon River 150 Sir Peter Blake a New Zealand world champion yachtsman was killed by pirates on the Amazon river in 2001 151 In the European Union vessels suffer river piracy with attacks on the Serbian and Romanian stretches of the Danube river an international waterway 152 153 154 Modern pirates favor small boats and taking advantage of the small number of crew members on modern cargo vessels They also use large vessels to supply the smaller attack boarding vessels Modern pirates can be successful because a large amount of international commerce occurs via shipping Major shipping routes take cargo ships through narrow bodies of water such as the Gulf of Aden and the Strait of Malacca making them vulnerable to be overtaken and boarded by small motorboats 155 156 Other active areas include the South China Sea and the Niger Delta As usage increases many of these ships have to lower cruising speeds to allow for navigation and traffic control making them prime targets for piracy Also pirates often operate in regions of poor developing or struggling countries with small or nonexistent navies and large trade routes Pirates sometimes evade capture by sailing into waters controlled by their pursuer's enemies With the end of the Cold War navies have decreased in size and patrol less frequently while trade has increased making organized piracy far easier Modern pirates are sometimes linked with organized crime syndicates but often are small individual groups The International Maritime Bureau I MB maintains statistics regarding pirate attacks dating back to 1995 Their records indicate hostage taking overwhelmingly dominates the types of violence against seafarers For example in 2006 there were 239 attacks 77 crew members were kidnapped and 188 taken hostage but only 15 of the pirate attacks resulted in murder 157 In 2007 the attacks rose by 10 percent to 263 attacks There was a 35 percent increase on reported attacks involving guns Crew members that were injured numbered 64 compared to just 17 in 2006 158 That number does not include instances of hostage taking and kidnapping where the victims were not injured The number of attacks from January to September 2009 had surpassed the previous year's total due to the increased pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden and off Somalia Between January and September the number of attacks rose to 306 from 293 Pirates boarded the vessels in 114 cases and hijacked 34 of them Gun use in pirate attacks increased to 176 cases from 76 in 2008 159 Rather than cargo modern pirates have targeted the personal belongings of the crew and the contents of the ship's safe which potentially contains large amounts of cash needed for payroll and port fees In other cases the pirates force the crew off the ship and then sail it to a port to be repainted and given a new identity through false papers purchased from corrupt or comp licit officials 160 Modern piracy can take place in conditions of political unrest For example following the U S withdrawal from Vietnam Thai piracy was aimed at the many Vietnamese who took to boats to escape Further following the disintegration of the government of Somalia warlords in the region have attacked ships delivering UN food aid 161 The attack against the German built cruise ship theSe abou rn Spirit offshore of Somalia in November 2005 is an example of the sophisticated pirates mariners face The pirates carried out their attack more than 100 miles 160 km offshore with speedboats launched from a larger mother ship The attackers were armed with automatic firearms and an RPG 162 Since 2008 Somali pirates centered in the Gulf of Aden made about 120 million annually reportedly costing the shipping industry between 900 million and 3 3 billion per year 163 By September 2012 the heyday of piracy in the Indian Ocean was reportedly over Backers were now reportedly reluctant to finance pirate expeditions due to the low rate of success and pirates were no longer able to reimburse their creditors 164 According to the International Maritime Bureau pirate attacks had by October 2012 dropped to a six year low 165 Only five ships were captured by the end of the year representing a decrease from 25 in 2011 and 27 in 2010 166 with only one ship attacked in the third quarter compared to 36 during the same period in 2011 165 However pirate incidents off on the West African seaboard increased to 34 from 30 the previous year and attacks off the coast of Indonesia rose from 2011's total of 46 to 51 165 Many nations forbid ships to enter their territorial waters or ports if the crew of the ships are armed in an effort to restrict possible piracy 167 Shipping companies sometimes hire private armed security guards Modern definitions of piracy include the following acts Together with treason and counterfeiting 168 piracy including acts against the law of nations 169 is one of three criminal offenses against which the United States Congress is delegated power to enact penal legislation by the Constitution of the United States 168 In modern times ships and airplanes are hijacked for political reasons as well The perpetrators of these acts could be described as pirates for instance the French term for plane hijacker is pirate de l ' air literally air pirate but in English are usually termed hijackers An example is the hijacking of the Italian civilian passenger ship Achille Lauro by the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1985 which is regarded as an act of piracy A 2009 book entitled International Legal Dimension of Terrorism called the attackers terrorists 170 Modern pirates also use a great deal of technology It has been reported that crimes of piracy have involved the use of mobile phones satellite phones GPS machetes AK 74 rifles sonar systems modern speedboats shotguns pistols mounted machine guns and even RPGs and grenade launchers citation needed In 2020 the amount of piracy increased by 24 after being at its lowest 21 st century level in 2019 The Americas and Africa have been identified by the International Chamber of Commerce as the most vulnerable to piracy as a result of less wealthy governments in the regions being unable to adequately combat piracy 171 I MB Piracy Reporting Centre keeps a live piracy map to help keep track of all recent piracy and armed robbery incidents 172 Under a principle of international law known as the universality principle a government may exercise jurisdiction over conduct outside its territory if that conduct is universally dangerous to states and their nationals 173 The rationale behind the universality principle is that states will punish certain acts wherever they may occur as a means of protecting the global community as a whole even absent a link between the state and the parties or the acts in question Under this principle the concept of universal jurisdiction applies to the crime of piracy 174 For example the United States has a statute section 1651 of title 18 of the United States Code imposing a sentence of life in prison for piracy as defined by the law of nations committed anywhere on the high seas regardless of the nationality of the pirates or the victims 175 The goal of maritime security operations is actively to deter disrupt and suppress piracy in order to protect global maritime security and secure freedom of navigation for the benefit of all nations 176 and pirates are often detained interrogated disarmed and released With millions of dollars at stake pirates have little incentive to stop In Finland one case involved pirates who had been captured and whose boat was sunk As the pirates attacked a vessel of Singapore not Finland and are not themselves EU or Finnish citizens they were not prosecuted A further complication in many cases including this one is that many countries do not allow extradition of people to jurisdictions where they may be sentenced to death or torture 177 The Dutch are using a 17 th century law against sea robbery to prosecute 178 Warships that capture pirates have no jurisdiction to try them and NATO does not have a detention policy in place Prosecutors have a hard time assembling witnesses and finding translators and countries are reluctant to imprison pirates because the countries would be saddled with the pirates upon their release 179 The Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia formed in November 2006 180 Since the 2010 s the U S Navy and others have been developing artificial intelligence A I based systems that generate piracy alerts based on surveillance data 181 182 The fourth volume of the handbook Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy off the Coast of Somalia and in the Arabian Sea Area known as BMP 4 183 is the current authoritative guide for merchant ships on self defense against pirates The guide is issued and updated by Oil Companies International Marine Forum OC IMF a consortium of interested international shipping and trading organizations including the EU NATO and the International Maritime Bureau 184 It is distributed primarily by the Maritime Security Centre Horn of Africa MS CHOA the planning and coordination authority for EU naval forces EU NAV FOR 184 The BMP 4 encourages vessels to register their voyages through the region with MS CHOA as this registration is a key component of the operation of the International Recommended Transit Corridor IRT C the navy patrolled route through the Gulf of Aden The BMP 4 contains a chapter entitled Self Protective Measures which lays out a list of steps a merchant vessel can take to make itself less of a target to pirates and make it better able to repel an attack if one occurs This list includes rigging the deck of the ship with razor wire rigging fire hoses to spray sea water over the side of the ship to hinder boarding s having a distinctive pirate alarm hardening the bridge against gunfire and creating a citadel where the crew can retreat if pirates get on board 184 Other unofficial self defense measures that can be found on merchant vessels include the setting up of mannequins posing as armed guards or firing flares at the pirates 185 Though it varies by country generally peacetime law in the 20 th and 21 st centuries has not allowed merchant vessels to carry weapons As a response to the rise in modern piracy however the U S government changed its rules so that it is now possible for U S flagged vessels to embark a team of armed private security guards The US Coastguard leaves it to ship owners ' discretion to determine if those guards will be armed 186 187 The International Chamber of Shipping ICS in 2011 changed its stance on private armed guards accepting that operators must be able to defend their ships against pirate attacks 188 This has given birth to a new breed of private security companies that provide training for crew members and operate floating armour ies for protection of crew and cargo This has proved effective in countering pirate attacks 189 190 The use of floating armour ies in international waters allows ships to carry weapons in international waters without being in possession of arms within coastal waters where they would be illegal Seychelles has become a central location for international anti piracy operations hosting the Anti Piracy Operation Center for the Indian Ocean In 2008 V SOS became the first authorized armed maritime security company to operate in the Indian Ocean region 191 With safety trials complete in the late 2000 s laser dazzle rs have been developed for defensive purposes on super yachts 192 They can be effective up to 4 kilometres 2 5 mi with the effects going from mild disorientation to flash blindness at closer range 193 In February 2012 Italian Marines based on the tanker En rica Le xie allegedly fired on an Indian fishing trawler off Kerala killing two of her eleven crew The Marines allegedly mistook the fishing vessel as a pirate vessel The incident sparked a diplomatic row between India and Italy En rica Le xie was ordered into Kochi where her crew were questioned by officers of the Indian Police 194 The fact is still sub juris and its legal eventual outcome could influence future deployment of V PDs since states will be either encouraged or discouraged to provide them depending on whether functional immunity is ultimately granted or denied to the Italians 195 Another similar incident has been reported to have happened in the Red Sea between the coasts of Somalia and Yemen involving the death of a Yemeni fisherman allegedly at the hands of a Russian Vessel Protection Detachment VP D on board a Norwegian flagged vessel 196 197 Despite VP D deployment being controversial because of these incidents according to the Associated Press 198 during a United Nations Security Council conference about piracy U S Ambassador Susan Rice told the council that no ship carrying armed guards has been successfully attacked by pirates and French Ambassador Gerard A raud stressed that private guards do not have the deterrent effect that government posted marine and sailors and naval patrols have in warding off attacks The best protection against pirates is to avoid encountering them This can be accomplished by using tools such as radar 199 or by using specialised systems that use shorter wavelengths as small boats are not always picked up by radar An example of a specialised system is Watch Stander 200 While the non wartime 20 th century tradition has been for merchant vessels not to be armed the U S Government has recently changed the rules so that it is now best practice for vessels to embark a team of armed private security guards 186 201 The guards are usually supplied from ships intended specifically for training and supplying such armed personnel 202 The crew can be given weapons training 203 and warning shots can be fired legally in international waters Other measures vessels can take to protect themselves against piracy are air press uri sed boat stopping systems which can fire a variety of vessel disabling projectiles 204 implementing a high free wall 205 and vessel boarding protection systems e g hot water wall electricity charged water wall automated fire monitor slippery foam 206 Ships can also attempt to protect themselves using their Automatic Identification Systems A IS 207 Every ship over 300 tons carries a transponder supplying both information about the ship itself and its movements Any unexpected change in this information can attract attention Previously this data could only be picked up if there was a nearby ship rendering single ships vulnerable Special satellites have been launched recently that are now able to detect and re transmit this data Large ships cannot therefore be hijacked without being detected This can act as a deterrent to attempts to either hijack the entire ship or steal large portions of cargo with another ship since an escort can be sent more quickly In an emergency warships can be called upon In some areas such as near Somalia patrolling naval vessels from different nations are available to intercept vessels attacking merchant vessels For patrolling dangerous coastal waters or keeping cost down robotic or remote controlled US Vs are also sometimes used 208 Shore and vessel launched U A Vs are used by the U S Navy 209 210 A British former British chief of defence staff David Richards questioned the value of expensive kit procured by successive governments saying We have 1 bn destroyers trying to sort out pirates in a little dhow with RPGs rocket propelled grenade launchers costing US 50 with an outboard motor costing 100 Section 2 of the Piracy Act 1837 creates a statutory offence of aggravated piracy See also the Piracy Act 1850 In 2008 the British Foreign Office advised the Royal Navy not to detain pirates of certain nationalities as they might be able to claim asylum in Britain under British human rights legislation if their national laws included execution or mutilation as a judicial punishment for crimes committed as pirates 211 See section 26 of and Schedule 5 to the Merchant Shipping and Maritime Security Act 1997 These provisions replace the Schedule to the Tokyo Convention Act 1967 In Cameron v HM Advocate 1971 S LT 333 the High Court of Justicia ry said that that Schedule supplemented the existing law and did not seek to restrict the scope of the offence of piracy jure gent i um See also See section 46 2 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 and section 6 of the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act 1878 See also R v Koh n 1864 4 F F 68 See section 5 of the Aviation Security Act 1982 The book Arch bold says that in a case that does not fall within section 2 of the Piracy Act 1837 the penalty appears to be determined by the Offences at Sea Act 1799 which provides that offences committed at sea are liable to the same penalty as if they had been committed upon the shore 212 William Hawkins said that under common law piracy by a subject was esteemed to be petty treason The Treason Act 1351 provided that this was not petty treason 213 In English admiralty law piracy was classified as petty treason during the medieval period and offenders were accordingly liable to be hanged drawn and quartered on conviction Piracy was redefined as a felony during the reign of Henry VIII In either case piracy cases were cog niz able in the courts of the Lord High Admiral English judges in admiralty courts and vice admiralty courts emphasized that neither Faith nor Oath is to be kept with pirates i e contracts with pirates and oaths sworn to them were not legally binding Pirates were legally subject to summary execution by their captors if captured in battle In practice instances of summary justice and annulment of oaths and contracts involving pirates do not appear to have been common citation needed In the United States criminal prosecution of piracy is authorized in the U S Constitution Art I Sec 8 cl 10 To define and punish Pira cie s and Felonies committed on the high Seas and Offences against the Law of Nations The founding fathers were at loggerheads over piracy 214 and the Marshall Court 1801 1835 dealt with many cases of piracy 215 216 In 1820 the penalty for piracy was death 217 By 1909 the penalty was life imprisonment 218 Title 18 U S C 1651 now states Whoever on the high seas commits the crime of piracy as defined by the law of nations and is afterwards brought into or found in the United States shall be imprisoned for life Citing the United States Supreme Court decision in the 1820 case of United States v Smith 1820 217 a U S District Court ruled in 2010 in the case of United States v Said that the definition of piracy under section 1651 is confined to robbery at sea The piracy charges but not other serious federal charges against the defendants in the Said case were dismissed by the Court 219 The U S District Court for the E D Va has since been overturned On May 23 2012 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued an opinion vacating the Court's dismissal of the piracy count United States v Said 680 F 3 d 374 4 th C ir 2012 See also United States v Dire 680 F 3 d 446 465 4 th C ir 2012 upholding an instruction to the jury that the crime of piracy includes ' any of the three following actions A any illegal acts of violence or detention or any act of depredation committed for private ends on the high seas or a place outside the jurisdiction of any state by the crew or the passengers of a private ship and directed against another ship or against persons or property on board such ship or B any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or C any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in A or B above ' The case was remanded to E D Va see US v Said 3 F Supp 3 d 515 Dist Court ED Virginia 2014 During the 18 th century the British and the Dutch controlled opposite sides of the Straits of Malacca The British and the Dutch drew a line separating the Straits into two halves The agreement was that each party would be responsible for combating piracy in their respective half Eventually this line became the border between Malaysia and Indonesia in the Straits Piracy is of note in international la was it is commonly held to represent the earliest invocation of the concept of universal jurisdiction The crime of piracy is considered a breach of jus co gens a conventional peremptory international norm that states must uphold Those committing thefts on the high seas inhibiting trade and endangering maritime communication are considered by sovereign states to hold the status of host is humani generis an enemy of humankind 220 Because of universal jurisdiction action can be taken against pirates without objection from the flag state of the pirate vessel This represents an exception to the principle extra terri to rium jus di centi im pune non p are tur One who exercises jurisdiction out of his territory is disobeyed with impunity 221 A Convention on Piracy was adopted by the League of Nations in 1932 To this day the Harvard Draft adds to the debate of what constitutes piracy 222 Articles 101 to 103 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea UNC LOS 1982 contain a definition of piracy iure gent i um i e according to international law 223 They read Article 101 Definition of piracy Piracy consists of any of the following acts Article 102 Piracy by a warship government ship or government aircraft whose crew has mutinied The acts of piracy as defined in article 101 committed by a warship government ship or government aircraft whose crew has mutinied and taken control of the ship or aircraft are assimilated to acts committed by a private ship or aircraft Article 103 Definition of a pirate ship or aircraft A ship or aircraft is considered a pirate ship or aircraft if it is intended by the persons in dominant control to be used for the purpose of committing one of the acts referred to in article 101 The same applies if the ship or aircraft has been used to commit any such act so long as it remains under the control of the persons guilty of that act 224 This definition was formerly contained in articles 15 to 17 of the Convention on the High Seas signed at Geneva on April 29 1958 225 It was drafted 226 by the International Law Commission 223 A limitation of article 101 above is that it confines piracy to the High Seas As the majority of piratical acts occur within territorial waters some pirates are able to go free as certain jurisdictions lack the resources to monitor their borders adequately citation needed The International Maritime Bureau I MB defines piracy as the act of boarding any vessel with an intent to commit theft or any other crime and with an intent or capacity to use force in furtherance of that act 227 Given the diverging definitions of piracy in international and municipal legal systems some authors argue that greater uniformity in the law is required in order to strengthen anti piracy legal instruments 228 Pirates are a frequent topic in fiction and in their Caribbean incarnation are associated with certain stereotypical manners of speaking and dress some of them wholly fictional nearly all our notions of their behavior come from the golden age of fictional piracy which reached its zenith in 1881 with the appearance of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island 229 Hugely influential in shaping the popular conception of pirates Captain Charles Johnson's A General History of the Pyrates published in London in 1724 is the prime source for the biographies of many well known pirates of the Golden Age 230 The book gives an almost mythical status to pirates with naval historian David Cord ingly writing it has been said and there seems no reason to question this that Captain Johnson created the modern conception of pirates 230 In the 1830 s Letitia Elizabeth Landon received material relating to piracy for an annual for which she was responsible and she produced two Pirate Songs the first in 1831 The Pirate's Song off Tiger Island and the second Bona the Pirate's Song in 1837 This last was reproduced many times as The Pirate's Song often uncredited Bona is now the city of Anna ba in Algeria Some inventions of pirate culture such as walking the plank in which a bound captive is forced to walk off a board extending over the sea were popularized by J M Barrie's 1911 novel Peter Pan where the fictional pirate Captain Hook and his crew helped define the fictional pirate archetype 231 English actor Robert Newton's portrayal of Long John Silver in Disney's 1950 film adaptation also helped define the modern rendition of a pirate including the stereotypical West Country pirate accent 232 233 Other influences includeS in bad the Sailor and the Pirates of the Caribbean films have helped rekindle modern interest in piracy and have performed well at the box office The video game Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag revolves around pirates during the Golden Age of Piracy The classic 1879 Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera The Pirates of Penzance focuses on The Pirate King and his hapless band of pirates 234 Many sports teams use pirate or a related term such as raider or buccaneer as their nickname based on the popular stereotypes of pirates The earliest such example was probably the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball that acquired their nickname in 1891 after allegedly pirating a player from another team 235 Many amateur and school based sports programs along with several professional sports franchises have also adopted pirate related names including the Las Vegas Raiders and Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League In turn the Buccaneer's name was inspired by the Gaspar ill a Pirate Festival a large community parade and related events in Tampa Florida centered around the legend of Jos Gaspar a mythical pirate who supposedly operated in the area Sources on the economics of piracy include Cyrus Karr aker's 1953 study Piracy was a Business 236 in which the author discusses pirates in terms of contemporary racketeering Patrick Crow hurst researched French piracy and David Starkey focused on British 18 th century piracy Note also the 1998 book The Invisible Hook The Hidden Economics of Pirates by Peter T Leeson 237 Some 2014 research examines the links between piracy and entrepreneurship In this context researchers take a non moral approach to piracy as a source of inspiration for 2010 s era entrepreneurship education 238 and to research in entrepreneurship 239 and in business model generation 240 In this respect analysis of piracy operations may distinguish between planned organised and opportunistic piracy 241",
