    "transformers_text": "Tegami Bachi ( テガミバチ ; \"Letter Bee\") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hiroyuki Asada . It was first serialized in Shueisha 's shōnen manga magazine Monthly Shōnen Jump from September 2006 to June 2007; after the magazine ceased publication, it was transferred to Jump Square , where it ran from November 2007 to November 2015. Its chapters were collected in 20 tankōbon volumes. The series is set in AmberGround, a land illuminated by an artificial sun, and follows Lag Seeing, a Letter Bee with the ability to see the memories of people and objects, and his personal Dingo Niche on their journeys across AmberGround.\n\nTegami Bachi was adapted into an anime television series by Pierrot+ , which aired for two seasons from October 2009 to March 2011. The manga was licensed for English release in North America by Viz Media ; it was published in their Shonen Jump magazine, and they have released its 20 volumes. Both seasons of the anime series have been licensed by Sentai Filmworks .\n\nThe story takes place in AmberGround, a land of perpetual night partially illuminated by an artificial sun. Lag Seeing, who used to work for the Bee Hive delivery service, is appointed as a Letter Bee, traveling with his Dingo (Bee's bodyguards), Niche, and her pet, Steak, to deliver letters and packages while avoiding the Gaichuu—giant armored insects who feed on the \"heart\" within letters and packages. When he was a child, his mother was kidnapped by men from AmberGround's capital, Akatsuki, and he was sent as a \"delivery\" to his aunt thanks to Gauche Suede, whom he began to idolize and who was his inspiration for becoming a Letter Bee. After Lag becomes a Letter Bee, he learns that Gauche has disappeared as the resistance movement Reverse begins stealing letters from traveling Bees. Lag later encounters Gauche, who is devoted to Reverse's cause and seems to have no memory of his past, despite Lag's attempts to make him remember.\n\nWritten and illustrated by Hiroyuki Asada , Tegami Bachi debuted in Shueisha 's Monthly Shōnen Jump on September 6, 2006.
