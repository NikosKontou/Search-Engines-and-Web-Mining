    "transformers_text": "Shipbuilding is the construction of ships and other floating vessels In modern times it normally takes place in a specialized facility known as a shipyard Shipbuilders also called shipwrights follow a specialized occupation that traces its roots to before recorded history Until recently with the development of complex non maritime technologies a ship has often represented the most advanced structure that the society building it could produce 1 ch 1 Some key industrial advances were developed to support shipbuilding for instance the sawing of timbers by mechanical saws propelled by windmills in Dutch shipyards during the first half of the 17 th century a 2 34 37 The design process saw the early adoption of the logarithm invented in 1615 to generate the curves used to produce the shape of a hull especially when scaling up these curves accurately in the mould loft 1 Shipbuilding and ship repairs both commercial and military are referred to as naval engineering The construction of boats is a similar activity called boat building The dismantling of ships is called ship breaking The earliest evidence of maritime transport by modern humans is the settlement of Australia between 50 000 and 60 000 years ago This almost certainly involved rafts possibly equipped with some sort of sail 3 29 33 Much of the development beyond that raft technology occurred in the nursery areas of the Mediterranean and in Maritime Southeast Asia Favoured by warmer waters and a number of inter visible islands boats and later ships with water tight hulls unlike the flow through structure of a raft could be developed 4 113 5 7 63 The ships of ancient Egypt were built by joining the hull planks together edge to edge with tenons set in mortices cut in the mating edges A similar technique but with the tenons being pinned in position by dowels was used in the Mediterranean for most of classical antiquity Both these variants are shell first techniques where any reinforcing frames are inserted after assembly of the planking has defined the hull shape 5 81 88 Car vel construction then took over in the Mediterranean Northern Europe used clinker construction but with some flush planked ship building in for instance the bottom planking of cogs 1 ch 4 The north European and Mediterranean traditions merged in the late 15 th century with car vel construction being adopted in the North and the centre line mounted rudder replacing the quarter rudder of the Mediterranean These changes broadly coincided with improvements in sailing rigs with the three masted ship becoming common with square sails on the fore and main masts and a fore and aft sail on the mizzen Ship building then saw a steady improvement in design techniques and introduction of new materials Iron was used for more than fastenings nails and bolts as structural components such as iron knees were introduced with examples existing in the mid 18 th century and from the mid 19 th century onwards This was partly led by the shortage of compass timber the naturally curved timber that meant that shapes could be cut without weaknesses caused by cuts across the grain of the timber 1 ch 8 Ultimately whole ships were made of iron and later steel The earliest known depictions including paintings and models of shallow water sailing boats is from the 6 th to 5 th millennium BC of the Ub aid period of Mesopotamia They were made from bundled reeds coated in bitumen and had bipod masts They sailed in shallow coastal waters of the Persian Gulf 6 Evidence from Ancient Egypt shows that the early Egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a ship hull as early as 3100 BC Egyptian pottery as old as 4000 BC shows designs of early fluvial boats or other means for navigation The Archaeological Institute of America reports 7 that some of the oldest ships yet unearthed are known as the Abydos boats These are a group of 14 ships discovered in Abydos that were constructed of wooden planks which were sewn together Discovered by Egyptologist David O ' Connor of New York University 8 woven straps were found to have been used to lash the planks together 7 and reeds or grass stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams 7 Because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to Pharaoh K hasek he mw y 8 originally they were all thought to have belonged to him but one of the 14 ships dates to 3000 BC 8 and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating 8 The ship dating to 3000 BC was about 75 feet 23 m long 8 and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh 8 According to professor O ' Connor the 5 000 year old ship may have even belonged to Pharaoh Aha 8 The Austronesian expansion which began c 3000 BC with migration from Taiwan to the island of Luzon in the Philippines spread across Island Southeast Asia Then between 1500 BC and 1500 AD they settled uninhabited islands of the Pacific and also sailed westward to Madagascar This is associated with distinctive maritime technology lashed lug construction techniques both in outrigger canoes and in large planked sailing vessels various types of outrigger and twin hulled canoes and a range of sailing rigs that included the crab claw sail The origins of this technology is difficult to date relying largely on linguistics studying the words for parts of boats the written comments of people from other cultures including the observations of European explorers at the time of first contact and the later more systematic ethnographic observations of the types of craft in use There is only a small body of archaeological evidence available Since Island Southeast Asia contained effective maritime transport between its very large number of islands long before Austronesian seafaring it is argued that Austronesian s adopted an existing maritime technology from the existing inhabitants of this region 9 50 64 10 85 88 11 487 488 Austronesian ships varied from simple canoes to large multi hull ships The simplest form of all ancestral Austronesian boats had five parts The bottom part consists of a single piece of hollowed out log At the sides were two planks and two horseshoe shaped wood pieces formed the prow and stern These were fitted tightly together edge to edge with dowels inserted into holes in between and then lashed to each other with ropes made from rattan or fiber wrapped around protruding lugs on the planks This characteristic and ancient Austronesian boat building practice is known as the lashed lug technique They were commonly caulked with pastes made from various plants as well as tap a bark and fibres which would expand when wet further tightening joints and making the hull watertight They formed the shell of the boat which was then reinforced by horizontal ribs Shipwrecks of Austronesian ships can be identified from this construction as well as the absence of metal nails Austronesian ships traditionally had no central rudders but were instead steered using an oar on one side 13 14 15 16 17 Austronesian s traditionally made their sails from woven mats of the resilient and salt resistant pandanus leaves These sails allowed Austronesian s to embark on long distance voyaging 18 19 The ancient Champ a of Vietnam also uniquely developed basket hulled boats whose hulls were composed of woven and resin caulked bamboo either entirely or in conjunction with plank st rakes They range from small c oracles the o th ng to large ocean going trading ships like the g he m nh 20 21 Early Egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with tree nails to fasten them together using pitch for caulking the seams The Khufu ship a 43 6 meter vessel sealed into a pit in the Giza pyramid complex at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza in the Fourth Dynasty around 2500 BC is a full size surviving example which may have fulfilled the symbolic function of a solar barque Early Egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with mortise and tenon joints 7 The oldest known tidal dock in the world was built around 2500 BC during the Harappan civilisation at Lot hal near the present day Man gro l harbour on the Gujarat coast in India Other ports were probably at Kot Bala and Dwarka However it is probable that many small scale ports and not massive ports were used for the Harappan maritime trade 22 Ships from the harbour at these ancient port cities established trade with Mesopotamia 23 full citation needed Shipbuilding and boat making may have been prosperous industries in ancient India 24 Native labourers may have manufactured the flotilla of boats used by Alexander the Great to navigate across the Hydaspes and even the Indus under Near chos 24 full citation needed The Indians also exported teak for shipbuilding to ancient Persia 25 Other references to Indian timber used for shipbuilding is noted in the works of Ibn Juba yr 25 The ships of Ancient Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty were typically about 25 meters 80 ft in length and had a single mast sometimes consisting of two poles lashed together at the top making an A shape They mounted a single square sail on a yard with an additional spar along the bottom of the sail These ships could also be oar propelled 27 The ocean and sea going ships of Ancient Egypt were constructed with cedar wood most likely hailing from Lebanon 28 The ships of Phoenicia seem to have been of a similar design Austronesian s established the Austronesian maritime trade network at around 1000 to 600 BC linking Southeast Asia with East Asia South Asia the Middle East and later East Africa The route later became part of the Spice trade network and the Maritime Silk Road 29 30 obsolete source 26 The naval history of China stems back to the Spring and Autumn period 722 BC 481 BC of the ancient Chinese Zhou dynasty The Chinese built large rectangular barges known as castle ships which were essentially floating fortresses complete with multiple decks with guarded ramparts However the Chinese vessels during this era were essentially fluvial riverine True ocean going Chinese fleets did not appear until the 10 th century Song dynasty 31 20 21 32 There is considerable knowledge regarding shipbuilding and seafaring in the ancient Mediterranean 33 Large multi masted seafaring ships of Southeast Asian Austronesian s first started appearing in Chinese records during the Han dynasty as the k ' un lun poor kunlun bo ship of the k ' un lun dark skinned southern people 34 These ships used two types of sail of their invention the junk sail and t anja sail Large ships are about 50 60 metres 164 197 ft long had 5 2 7 8 metres 17 26 ft tall free board 35 each carrying provisions enough for a year 36 464 and could carry 200 1000 people The Chinese recorded that these Southeast Asian ships were hired for passage to South Asia by Chinese Buddhist pilgrims and travelers because they did not build seaworthy ships of their own until around the 8 9 th century AD 32 276 Austronesian s especially from western Island Southeast Asia were trading in the Indian Ocean as far as Africa during this period By around 50 to 500 AD a group of Austronesian s believed to be from the southeastern coasts of Borneo possibly a mixed group related to the modern Ma ' any an Banja r and or the Day ak people crossed the Indian Ocean and colonized Madagascar This resulted in the introduction of outrigger canoe technology to non Austronesian cultures in the East African coast 37 The ancient Chinese also built fluvial ramming vessels as in the Greco Roman tradition of the trireme although oar steered ships in China lost favor very early on since it was in the 1 st century China that the stern mounted rudder was first developed This was du ally met with the introduction of the Han dynasty junk ship design in the same century The Chinese were using square sails during the Han dynasty and adopted the Austronesian junk sail later in the 12 th century 31 20 21 Icon o graphic remains show that Chinese ships before the 12 th century used square sails and the junk rig of Chinese ships is believed to be developed from tilted sails 38 612 613 Southern Chinese junks were based on keeled and multi planked Austronesian ship known as po by the Chinese from the Old Javanese para hu 39 1280 Javanese p rau or Malay per ahu large ship 40 613 41 42 Southern Chinese junks showed characteristics of Austronesian ships that they are made using timbers of tropical origin with keeled V shaped hull This is different from northern Chinese junks which are developed from flat bottomed riverine boats 31 20 21 The northern Chinese junks were primarily built of pine or fir wood had flat bottoms with no keel water tight bulkheads with no frames transom squared stern and stem and have their planks fastened with iron nails or clamps 40 612 614 It was unknown when the Chinese people started adopting Southeast Asian Austronesian shipbuilding techniques They may have been started as early as the 8 th century but the development was gradual and the true ocean going Chinese junks did not appear suddenly 43 276 44 200 45 The word po survived in Chinese long after referring to the large ocean going junks 43 274 In September 2011 archeological investigations done at the site of Port us in Rome revealed inscriptions in a shipyard constructed during the reign of Trajan 98 117 that indicated the existence of a shipbuilders guild 46 Roughly at this time is the last migration wave of the Austronesian expansion when the Polynesian islands spread over vast distances across the Pacific Ocean were being colonized by the Austronesian Polynesians from Island Melanesia using double hulled voyaging catamarans At its furthest extent there is a possibility that they may have reached the Americas 47 After the 11 th century a new type of ship called d jong or jong was recorded in Java and Bali 48 49 This type of ship was built using wooden dowels and tree nails unlike the kunlun bo which used vegeta l fibres for lashing s 50 The empire of Maja pah it used jong built in northern Java for transporting troops overseas 51 The jong s were transport ships which could carry 100 2000 tons of cargo and 50 1000 people 28 99 88 56 meter in length 52 The exact number of jong fielded by Maja pah it is unknown but the largest number of jong deployed in an expedition is about 400 jong s when Maja pah it attacked Pas a i in 1350 53 Until recently Viking longships were seen as marking an advance on traditional clinker built hulls where leather thongs were used to join plank boards 54 This consensus has recently been challenged Haywood 55 has argued that earlier Frankish and Anglo Saxon nautical practice was much more accomplished than had been thought and has described the distribution of clinker vs car vel construction in Western Europe see map 1 An insight into shipbuilding in the North Sea Baltic areas of the early medieval period was found at Sutton Hoo England where a ship was buried with a chieftain The ship was 26 metres 85 ft long and 4 3 metres 14 ft 56 wide Upward from the keel the hull was made by overlapping nine st rakes on either side with rivets fastening the oaken planks together It could hold upwards of thirty men Sometime around the 12 th century northern European ships began to be built with a straight stern post enabling the mounting of a rudder which was much more durable than a steering oar held over the side Development in the Middle Ages favored round ships 57 with a broad beam and heavily curved at both ends Another important ship type was the galley which was constructed with both sails and oars The first extant treatise on shipbuilding was written c 1436 by Michael of Rhodes 58 a man who began his career as an oarsman on a Venetian galley in 1401 and worked his way up into officer positions He wrote and illustrated a book that contains a treatise on shipbuilding a treatise on mathematics much material on astrology and other materials His treatise on shipbuilding treats three kinds of galleys and two kinds of round ships 59 Shipbuilders in the Ming dynasty 1368 1644 were not the same as the shipbuilders in other Chinese dynasties due to hundreds of years of accumulated experiences and rapid changes in the Ming dynasty Shipbuilders in the Ming dynasty primarily worked for the government under command of the Ministry of Public Works During the early years of the Ming dynasty the Ming government maintained an open policy towards sailing Between 1405 and 1433 the government conducted seven diplomatic Ming treasure voyages to over thirty countries in Southeast Asia India the Middle East and Eastern Africa The voyages were initiated by the Yongle Emperor and led by the Admiral Zheng He Six voyages were conducted under the Yongle Emperor's reign the last of which returned to China in 1422 After the Yongle Emperor's death in 1424 his successor the Hong xi Emperor ordered the suspension of the voyages The seventh and final voyage began in 1430 sent by the Xuan de Emperor Although the Hong xi and Xuan de Emperors did not emphasize sailing as much as the Yongle Emperor they were not against it This led to a high degree of commercialization and an increase in trade Large numbers of ships were built to meet the demand 60 61 The Ming voyages were large in size numbering as many as 300 ships and 28 000 men 62 The shipbuilders were brought from different places in China to the shipyard in Nanjing including Zhejiang Jiangxi Fujian and Hu guang now the provinces of Hubei and Hunan One of the most famous shipyards was Long Jiang Shipyard zh located in Nanjing near the Treasure Shipyard where the ocean going ships were built 60 The shipbuilders could build 24 models of ships of varying sizes 60 Several types of ships were built for the voyages including Sha chuan Fu chuan and Bao chuan treasure ship 63 Zheng He's treasure ships were regarded as Sha chuan types mainly because they were made in the treasure shipyard in Nanjing Sha chuan or 's and ships ' are ships used primarily for inland transport 60 However in recent years some researchers agree that the treasure ships were more of the Fu chuan type It is said in vol 176 of San Guo Bei Meng Hui Bian that ships made in Fujian are the best ones 63 Therefore the best shipbuilders and laborers were brought from these places to support Zheng He's expedition The shipyard was under the command of Ministry of Public Works The shipbuilders had no control over their lives The builders commoner's doctors cooks and errands had lowest social status 64 The shipbuilders were forced to move away from their hometown to the shipyards There were two major ways to enter the shipbuilder occupation family tradition or apprenticeship If a shipbuilder entered the occupation due to family tradition the shipbuilder learned the techniques of shipbuilding from his family and is very likely to earn a higher status in the shipyard Additionally the shipbuilder had access to business networking that could help to find clients If a shipbuilder entered the occupation through an apprenticeship the shipbuilder was likely a farmer before he was hired as a shipbuilder or he was previously an experienced shipbuilder Many shipbuilders working in the shipyard were forced into the occupation The ships built for Zheng He's voyages needed to be waterproof solid safe and have ample room to carry large amounts of trading goods Therefore due to the highly commercialized society that was being encouraged by the expeditions trades and government policies the shipbuilders needed to acquire the skills to build ships that fulfil these requirements Shipbuilding was not the sole industry utilising Chinese lumber at that time the new capital was being built in Beijing from approximately 1407 onwards 60 which required huge amounts of high quality wood These two ambitious projects commissioned by Emperor Yongle would have had enormous environmental and economic effects even if the ships were half the dimensions given in the History of Ming Considerable pressure would also have been placed on the infrastructure required to transport the trees from their point of origin to the shipyards 60 Shipbuilders were usually divided into different groups and had separate jobs Some were responsible for fixing old ships some were responsible for making the keel and some were responsible for building the helm After 1477 the Ming government reversed its open maritime policies enacting a series of isolationist policies in response to piracy The policies called Hai j in sea ban lasted until the end of the Ming dynasty in 1644 During this period Chinese navigation technology did not make any progress and even declined in some aspect 60 In the Islamic world shipbuilding thrived at Basra and Alexandria The dhow fe lucca bagh lah and the sam buk became symbols of successful maritime trade around the Indian Ocean from the ports of East Africa to Southeast Asia and the ports of Sindh and Hind India during the Abbasid period Mughal Empire had a large shipbuilding industry which was largely centred in the Bengal Sub ah citation needed Economic historian Indra j it Ray estimates shipbuilding output of Bengal during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries at 223 250 tons annually compared with 23 061 tons produced in nineteen colonies in North America from 1769 to 1771 65 He also assesses ship repairing as very advanced in Bengal 65 Documents from 1506 for example refer to watercraft on the Sierra Leone river carrying 120 men Others refer to Guinea coast peoples using war canoes of varying sizes some 70 feet in length 7 8 feet broad with sharp pointed ends rowing benches on the side and quarterdecks or forecastles build of reeds The watercraft included miscellaneous facilities such as cooking hearths and storage spaces for the crew's sleeping mats 66 From the 17 th century some kingdoms added brass or iron cannons to their vessels 67 By the 18 th century however the use of swivel cannons on war canoes accelerated The city state of Lagos for instance deployed war canoes armed with swivel cannons 66 With the development of the car rack the west moved into a new era of ship construction by building the first regular oceangoing vessels In a relatively short time these ships grew to an unprecedented size complexity and cost The United Kingdom was one of the principal shipping nations in the 19 th century By 1815 at the end of the Napoleonic wars the tonnage of the mercantile marine in the United Kingdom was roughly twice that of the United States 68 Britain also was a major shipbuilding nation By 1841 there were 20 424 men and boys employed in building ships in the United Kingdom 69 Shipyards became large industrial complexes and the ships built were financed by consortia of investors These considerations led to the documentation of design and construction practices in what had previously been a secretive trade run by master shipwrights and ultimately led to the field of naval architecture in which professional designers and draftsmen played an increasingly important role 70 Even so construction techniques changed only very gradually The ships of the Napoleonic Wars were still built more or less to the same basic plan as those of the Spanish Armada of two centuries earlier although there had been numerous subtle improvements in ship design and construction throughout this period For instance the introduction of tumble home adjustments to the shapes of sails and hulls the introduction of the wheel the introduction of hardened copper fastenings below the waterline the introduction of copper sheathing as a deterrent to ship worm and fouling etc 71 page needed Initially copying wooden construction traditions with a frame over which the hull was fastened Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Great Britain of 1843 was the first radical new design being built entirely of wrought iron Despite her success and the great savings in cost and space provided by the iron hull compared to a copper sheathed counterpart there remained problems with fouling due to the adherence of weeds and barnacles As a result composite construction remained the dominant approach where fast ships were required with wooden timbers laid over an iron frame Cut ty Sarkis a famous example Later Great Britain's iron hull was sheathed in wood to enable it to carry a copper based sheathing Brunel's Great Eastern represented the next great development in shipbuilding Built in association with John Scott Russell it used longitudinal stringers for strength inner and outer hulls and bulkheads to form multiple watertight compartments Steel also supplanted wrought iron when it became readily available in the latter half of the 19 th century providing great savings when compared with iron in cost and weight Wood continued to be favored for the decks During World War II the need for cargo ships was so great that construction time for Liberty ships went from initially eight months or longer down to weeks or even days They employed production line and prefabrication techniques such as those used in shipyards today The total number of dry cargo ships built in the United States in a 15 year period just before the war was a grand total of two During the war thousands of Liberty ships and Victory ships were built many of them in shipyards that did not exist before the war And they were built by a workforce consisting largely of women and other inexperienced workers who had never seen a ship before or even the ocean 72 73 74 After World War II shipbuilding which encompasses the shipyards the marine equipment manufacturers and many related service and knowledge providers grew as an important and strategic industry in a number of countries around the world This importance stems from Historically the industry has suffered from the absence of global rules citation needed and a tendency towards state supported over investment due to the fact that shipyards offer a wide range of technologies employ a significant number of workers and generate income as the shipbuilding market is global Japan used shipbuilding in the 1950 s and 1960 s to rebuild its industrial structure South Korea started to make shipbuilding a strategic industry in the 1970 s and China is now in the process of repeating these models with large state supported investments in this industry Conversely Croatia is privat ising its shipbuilding industry As a result the world shipbuilding market suffers from over capacities depressed prices although the industry experienced a price increase in the period 2003 2005 due to strong demand for new ships which was in excess of actual cost increases low profit margins trade distortions and widespread sub sid is ation All efforts to address the problems in the OECD have so far failed with the 1994 international shipbuilding agreement never entering into force and the 2003 2005 round of negotiations being paused in September 2005 after no agreement was possible After numerous efforts to restart the negotiations these were formally terminated in December 2010 The OECD's Council Working Party on Shipbuilding WP 6 will continue its efforts to identify and progressively reduce factors that distort the shipbuilding market Where state subsidies have been removed and domestic industrial policies do not provide support in high labor cost countries shipbuilding has gone into decline The British shipbuilding industry is a prime example of this with its industries suffering badly from the 1960 s In the early 1970 s British yards still had the capacity to build all types and sizes of merchant ships but today they have been reduced to a small number specialising in defence contracts luxury yachts and repair work Decline has also occurred in other European countries although to some extent this has reduced by protective measures and industrial support policies In the US the Jones Act which places restrictions on the ships that can be used for moving domestic cargoes has meant that merchant shipbuilding has continued albeit at a reduced rate but such protection has failed to penal is e shipbuilding inefficiencies The consequence of this is that contract prices are far higher than those of any other country building oceangoing ships Beyond the 2000 s the three East Asian manufacturing powerhouses China South Korea and Japan have dominated world shipbuilding by completed gross tonnage 75 China State Shipbuilding Corporation China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation Hyundai Heavy Industries Samsung Heavy Industries Daewoo Shipbuilding Marine Engineering an dIma bari Shipbuilding supply most of the global market for large container bulk carrier tanker and Ro ro ships During the early 2020 s Chinese shipbuilders saw an increase in orders as operators demand greener fleets 76 As of 2023 update China's shipbuilding output newly received orders and orders on hand accounted for 50 67 and 55 of the global market share respectively with double digital growth of all three indexes compared to the previous year 77 According to a September 2023 report by the Alliance for American Manufacturing based on a leaked presentation slide from an earlier USN briefing verified by the Office of Naval Intelligence 78 China's shipbuilding capacity is 232 times greater than the United States with a manufacturing capacity of roughly 23 250 000 million tons compared to less than 100 000 tons by U S shipyards 79 When referring to the ship type then China South Korea and Japan are the producing countries of the carrier ships as mentioned above While Italy France Finland Germany United Kingdom and other European countries are the makers of cruise ships the most icebreakers crane vessel and so on citation needed The market share of European ship builders began to decline in the 1960 s as they lost work to Japan in the same way Japan most recently lost their work to South Korea and China Over the four years from 2007 the total number of employees in the European shipbuilding industry declined from 150 000 to 115 000 80 In 2022 some key shipbuilders in Europe are Fin can tier i Da men Group Nav anti a Naval Group and BAE Systems 81 Shipbuilding output of the United States also underwent a similar change 82 83 The US is ranked the 10 th largest shipbuilder worldwide when The top companies that build large naval vessels such as aircraft carriers and cruisers include Huntington Ingalls Bollinger and General Dynamics In the small to medium military vessels category key shipbuilders include Vigor Industrial and VT Halter Marine As the US Navy is shifting to a new fleet architecture that is more widely distributed unmanned surface vehicles US Vs development is rapidly propelled to higher priority 84 Key strategic Program of Record includes prototyping and construction of up to 9 MUS Vs for which a sole contract was awarded to L 3 Harris Technologies who partnered with Swift ships to build the MUS Vs 85 86 In 2018 the US Defense Department initiated Overlord Program and developed USV Prototypes 1 NOMAD and 2 RANGER Both of them took part in multiple fleet level exercises and demonstrations traveled 28 982 nautical miles 53 675 km in autonomous mode and tested numerous payloads 87 No mam formerly known as Riley Claire is a converted offshore patrol vessel which was built by Swift ships 88 89 The objective of the Ghost Fleet Overlord program is to convert large commercial vessels to autonomous systems As of 2024 update China builds nearly 75 of new vessels on order 90 and has the capacity to build more ships in one month than the United States builds in a year 91 92 Modern shipbuilding makes considerable use of prefabricated modular sections Entire multi deck segments of the hull or superstructure will be built elsewhere in the yard transported to the building dock or slip way then lifted into place This is known as block construction The most modern shipyards pre install equipment pipes electrical cables and any other components within the blocks to minimize the effort needed to assemble or install components deep within the hull once it is welded together citation needed Ship design work also called naval architecture may be conducted using a ship model basin Previously lofts men at the mould lofts of shipyards were responsible for taking the dimensions and details from drawings and plans and translating this information into templates battens ordinates cutting sketches profiles margins and other data 93 However since the early 1970 s computer aided design became normal for the shipbuilding design and lofting process 94 Modern ships since roughly 1940 have been produced almost exclusively of welded steel Early welded steel ships used steels with inadequate fracture toughness which resulted in some ships suffering catastrophic brittle fracture structural cracks see problems of the Liberty ship Since roughly 1950 specialized steels such as ABS Steels with good properties for ship construction have been used Although it is commonly accepted that modern steel has eliminated brittle fracture in ships some controversy still exists 95 Brittle fracture of modern vessels continues to occur from time to time because grade A and grade B steel of unknown toughness or fracture appearance transition temperature FAT T in ships ' side shells can be less than adequate for all ambient conditions 96 As modern shipbuilding panels on a panel line become lighter and thinner the laser hybrid welding technique is utilized The laser hybrid blend focuses a higher energy beam on the material to be joined allowing it to keyhole with a much higher depth to width ratio than comparative traditional welding techniques Typically a MIG process trails the keyhole providing filler material for the weld joint This allows for very high penetration without excessive heat input from decreased weld metal deposited leading to less distortion and welding at higher travel speeds citation needed All ships need repair work at some point in their working lives A part of these jobs must be carried out under the supervision of the classification society A lot of maintenance is carried out while at sea or in port by ship's crew However a large number of repair and maintenance works can only be carried out while the ship is out of commercial operation in a ship repair yard Prior to undergoing repairs a tanker must dock at a de ballasting station for completing the tank
