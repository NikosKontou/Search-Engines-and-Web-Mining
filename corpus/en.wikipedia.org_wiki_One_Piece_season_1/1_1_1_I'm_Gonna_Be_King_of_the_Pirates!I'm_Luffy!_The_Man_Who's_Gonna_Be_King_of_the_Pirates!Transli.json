Kōnosuke Uda Junki Takegami 612.4 October 20, 1999(1999-10-20)[5] September 18, 2004[6]\n\nIn the ocean,Alvidaand her pirate crew attack a cruise ship.Coby, a slave of Alvida, discovers a barrel. One of Alvida's pirates attempts to open the barrel, but a young boy emerges and accidentally hits him. The remaining pirates attack him, but the stranger stops them and says that his name isMonkey D. Luffy. Luffy drags Coby to the storage cellar of the ship, where he eats and converses with Coby, who reveals his dream of being a marine as Luffy reveals his dream to become the King of the Pirates. Alvida confronts Luffy, but he escapes and knocks her pirate crew down with his Devil Fruit power, to Coby's shock. Luffy explains that he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit, therefore he has the properties of rubber. Coby, inspired by Luffy, stands up for himself when Alvida confronts them. Luffy uses hisGum-Gum Pistoltechnique on Alvida, defeating her and sending her flying into the sea. Luffy and Coby sail away in a \"borrowed\" boat from Alvida's crew. Luffy asks about the bounty hunter that Coby mentioned earlier. Coby says that he was captured by the Marines, and Luffy announces his intention of asking him to join his crew.",
