Then Smoker catches Buggy and Alvida and gets on a Dune Buggy to follow Luffy. Meanwhile, Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji run into Tashigi. Zoro defeats her reluctantly. Then Smoker catches up and tells Luffy that he must get through him to go to the Grand Line. Luffy isn't able to effectively fight Smoker due to the latter's Plume-Plume Fruit powers allowing him to turn into smoke. Just when Smoker is about to finish off Luffy a mysterious man with a green cloak named Dragon saves him. A green gust of wind blows through that lets Buggy and Alvida escape. Then Luffy and company can get away. Smoker, Tashigi, Alvida, and Buggy all depart to chase the Straw Hats into the Grand Line.",
