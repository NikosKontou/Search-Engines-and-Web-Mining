Sanji no Meshi to Ghin no On\" (Japanese:招かれざる客!サンジの飯とギンの恩) Hidehiko Kadota Junki Takegami 315.0 April 12, 2000(2000-04-12)[39] February 12, 2005[41]\n\nAfter a review of the last episode, the episode begins with Patty, a cook for Baratie, picking his nose in the bathroom while making a monologue about how serving the customers who have money is the number one concern for a restaurant. Upon leaving the bathroom, Patty becomes furious when he sees thatSanjiis beating upFullbody, who is a customer. Sanji replies that customer or not, Fullbody insulted a chef and his food. At this moment, the head chef andLuffycome crashing down from the ceiling because the head chef was kicking Luffy too hard while trying to convince him that he has to work at Baratie for a whole year to pay off his debt. The head chef then kicks Sanji to calm him down and also kicks Fullbody out of the restaurant. Fullbody's subordinate then comes running into the restaurant yelling that their prisoner, a member ofDon Krieg's pirates, has escaped. The customers are terrified because Don Krieg is supposedly the strongest pirate in the East Blue. The pirate shoots the marine from behind and comes in to order food. Patty recognizes the pirate as a customer and asks if the pirate has any money on him. The pirate points a gun at Patty and says \"is a bullet okay?\" Patty then beats the pirate up and doesn't recognize the pirate as a customer since he has no money. Sanji, on the other hand, heads to the kitchen and starts making a meal. Fullbody, in the meantime, leaves the restaurant sneakily (along with the subordinate who got shot earlier, who is still alive). Sanji brings his meal to the pirate, who was thrown out by Patty. Sanji states that, for him, a customer is anybody who is hungry, and that he understands the feeling of starvation more than anybody else. The pirate then grabs the meal and gobbles it up, while crying and saying that this is the most delicious dish he has ever had in his entire life. Luffy, who was watching the whole thing, attempts to recruit Sanji as the cook for his crew. After refusing and some conversing, it is revealed that the head chef used to be a notorious pirate and the restaurant often comes into conflict with other pirates after his fame. Luffy, as always, is stubborn and insists that Sanji joins them. We also find out that the other pirate's name isGhin. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, the line cooks explain that Don Krieg is the captain of a fleet of fifty ships. Ghin thanks Sanji for the meal and leaves. Sanji throws the dishes into the ocean to get rid of the evidence that he is giving out food for free, which makes Ghin even more grateful. Luffy is then sent back to work, where he ends up breaking even more dishes and makes a big commotion in the kitchen. The rest of the crew,Zoro,Nami, andUsopp, turn out to be eating at the restaurant. Sanji, after seeing Nami, is captivated by her beauty. While flirting with Nami, the head chef tells Sanji that he's annoying and that he doesn't need him anymore. Meanwhile, Ghin informsDon Kriegof the restaurant, where Don Krieg makes clear his intention to \"visit\" the restaurant.",
