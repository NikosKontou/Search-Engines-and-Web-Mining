Junji Shimizu Junki Takegami 912.1 June 7, 2000(2000-06-07)[53] April 2, 2005[54]\n\nOut of nowhere, a gas mask lands in Luffy's lap and he puts it on, just as the MH5 impacts and explodes. It is revealed that the mask was Gin's, while he held Sanji's to his face. Krieg succeeds in poisoning Gin, and Patty and Carne pull him inside the Baratie to administer first aid. Outraged once again, Luffy runs for Krieg, who pulls out his Needle Gun again, but the bullets don't even hinder Luffy as he prepeares his Gum-Gum Pistol. Krieg pulls out his spiked Porcupine Cape and covers himself, but Luffy punches right into Krieg's face. Luffy seems to have the advantage in the fight until Krieg pulls out his explosive Battle Spear. Luffy takes a hit every time he strikes the spear, but eventually breaks the tip.",
