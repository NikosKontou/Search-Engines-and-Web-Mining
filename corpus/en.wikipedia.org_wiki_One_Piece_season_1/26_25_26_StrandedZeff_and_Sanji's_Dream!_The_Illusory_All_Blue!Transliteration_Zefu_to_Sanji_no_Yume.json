He reveals that he worked on a cruise ship that Zeff attacked, and when a storm hit, the two were the only survivors. Zeff sacrificed his leg to save Sanji and gave Sanji food, as both shared the same dream of finding the legendary ocean, All Blue - supposedly a place where the four seas meet and all the world's sealife intermingles. No longer able to fight with his legs and be a pirate, Zeff founded the Baratie. Sanji claims that he will defend the Baratie with his life, and an enraged Luffy responds by attacking the ship's porch with Gum-Gum Axe.",
