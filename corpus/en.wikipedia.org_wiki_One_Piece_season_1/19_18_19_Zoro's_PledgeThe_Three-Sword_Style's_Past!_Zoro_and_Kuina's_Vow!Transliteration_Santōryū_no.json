Kōnosuke Uda Junki Takegami 414.3 March 22, 2000(2000-03-22)[37] January 29, 2005[38]\n\nWhile Usopp and Luffy fool around with the ship's cannon one day, Zoro dreams about his childhood. He had joined a dojo after losing to the teacher's daughter, Kuina. Despite training and growing stronger, he still was unable to defeat her. When she told him that he would one day defeat her as she grew comparatively weaker, Zoro grew upset over her defeatist attitude, and made her promise that one of them would be the greatest swordsman in the world. She died soon afterward, and Zoro dedicated himself to surpassing Kuina and fulfilling the promise. Back in the present, a bounty hunter attacks the ship, but Zoro recognizes him.",
