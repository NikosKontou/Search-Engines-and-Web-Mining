Opened in 1997, the stadium was the home field of the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes . In 2005, the stadium became one of the homes of the Orix Buffaloes , a result of the merger between the Orix BlueWave and Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes. Prior to the Osaka Dome opening, the Buffaloes played their home games at Fujiidera Stadium . The Hanshin Tigers also use the stadium as their \"home field\" for their season openers and their home games in August because their stadium, Koshien Stadium , is used for high school baseball tournaments during those periods. [ 2 ]\n\nThe Dome hosted the Pride Total Elimination 2005 and Pride Total Elimination Absolute mixed martial arts fights.\n\nKyocera Corporation subsidiary Kyocera Document Solutions Incorporated has been advertising at Osaka Dome since April 2003.

On March 2, 2006, Kyocera captured the naming rights of the domed stadium and it was scheduled to be named \" Kyocera Dome Osaka (京セラドーム大阪)\" on April 1. However, the contract entering was delayed until July 1 due to the reorganization of the Dome Company. The original contract was for five years, and it has since been renewed several times.\n\nHome Stadiums in Osaka, Osaka Prefecture and Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture",
