    "transformers_text": "Sanji Sanji born as V in smoke Sanji V in sum ku Sanji and also known as Black Leg Sanji Kuro A shi no Sanji is a fictional character in the One Piece franchise created by Eiichiro Oda The character made his first appearance in the 43 rd chapter of the series which was first published in Japan in Shueisha's Weekly Sh nen Jump magazine on June 8 1998 He is the fifth member of the Straw Hat Pirates and the fourth to join serving as their cook A native to the North Blue Sanji grew up as part of the V in smoke family under his father V in smoke Judge king of the fallen Germ a Kingdom and mother V in smoke Sora 6 After leaving his abusive family and surviving a shipwreck almost starving to death on a rock he was taken under the wing of Red Foot Zef f 7 a former pirate and owner of the floating restaurant Bara tie who taught him cooking and his fighting style which is characterized by the use of legs in combat leaving his hands for cooking Following a battle against Don Krieg Sanji joins the Straw Hats in order to fulfill his dream of finding the All Blue a mythical sea said to have fish from around the world Despite his calm and rational nature he is known for his constantly enamored behavior around beautiful women especially Nami to the point he refuses to attack women to the crew's and his own detriment Early designs show that originally Sanji was going to be a gun wielding black haired character named Naruto but that idea was scrapped 8 Oda was inspired by Mr Pink Steve Buscemi's character in Reservoir Dogs 1992 when creating Sanji 9 Sanji is a tall light skinned slender man who has a small waist He commonly wears a black shirt and smokes a cigarette Before the time skip Sanji is seen with his blonde hair covering his left eye However after the time skip his hair covers his right eye Before leaving his family Sanji styled his hair in the opposite direction and wore a yellow shirt with a black number three on it He also wore white pants brown boots and a yellow bandana After leaving his family and still a child he started wearing a white cook's uniform Sanji grows a goatee during the time skip and concept art shows this was his original design 10 Sanji's most distinctive feature is his eyebrows which are characterized as swirls with the tail end pointing at his left side opposite in direction in comparison to his siblings Ichi ji N iji Yon ji and Rei ju Oda revealed Sanji's real world nationality would be a Frenchman in contrast to the Nazi Germany themes of Germ a 66 11 Sanji is mostly seen as a composed nonchalant and calm individual who always keeps his cool when in dire situations However this is contrasted by the many comedic gags he partakes in such as when in the presence of a lady or when insulted by a crew member Most notably Sanji and Zoro have a great rivalry often resorting to fighting both verbally and physically Sanji is also known to have an enamored personality constantly flirting with any attractive woman he sees earning him the nickname ero cook Even as a child while working in Bara tie Sanji would become love struck with attractive female customers and end up making mistakes in the process of cooking He also shows jealousy towards those that he perceives to be luckier than him with women such as when he sees Zoro with Hi yori and Luffy arriving at Amazon Lily out of pure luck 12 Despite this nature Sanji exhibits some self restraint due to his loyalty to his crew as is shown by the fact that in spite of being attracted to Pudding he sternly refused to marry her and decided to let her down gently 13 Moreover due to this attitude and the multiple lectures from Zef f Sanji follows his own strict set of personal morals in the form of chivalry He has sworn to never attack women or let them be insulted even at the cost of his own life and has gone so far as to only block against Kali fa one of the main antagonists of the Eni es Lobby Arc until Nami could help him 14 Sanji overcame his childhood trauma and accepted his nature after Luffy saves him from an arranged marriage during the Whole Cake Island Arc 15 Sanji is kind and often saves others in danger even at the cost of his own safety Oftentimes he frames this kindhearted nature as mere chivalry towards women but in his actions he consistently helps men as well Having suffered from starvation among the litany of abuse put upon him by his father he never denies a person a meal regardless of their intentions as shown when Don Krieg attempted to take over the Bara tie during his introductory arc Frequently during the series he separates himself from everyone else to play a clandestine role which subsequently helps the crew and other allies survive In Water 7 Sanji separates from the crew and finds Nico Robin boarding the Puffing Tom on its way to Eni es Lobby for her execution 16 In Thriller Bark he offers to give up his life in exchange for Luffy's 17 In Zo u Sanji decided to leave the crew in order to confront his family and protect the Straw Hats from the Fire Tank Pirates 18 In Wa no Sanji asks for help from another for the first time when he asks Robin to save him 15 In the original Japanese version of the One Piece anime series Sanji is voiced by Hiroaki Hi rata as an adult and Ik ue tani as a child 19 In Ode x's dubs of the first 104 episodes of One

Taz Skylar in the live action adaptation of One Piece 20 while Christian Con very portrays young Sanji 21 When fighting Sanji only ever relies on kicks never punching opponents because of his belief that a cook's hands are important instruments for their craft and thus must be protected from harm Over the course of the series Sanji utilizes attacks that are variations of kicks deemed Black Leg Style with the name of the attack usually having something to do with food such as Diable Jam be where in he raises the temperatures of his legs so high that they glow bright red 22 During his time on Momo i ro Island Sanji learns a move named Sky Walk which allows him to jump to great heights and to be able to float mid air by making sonic booms in the air behind him 23 Sanji is one of the few high bounty individuals that has not consumed a Devil Fruit fruits that give the consumer superhuman powers at the expense of becoming a dead weight in water After Whole Cake Island Sanji receives a Raid Suit gifted from Germ a 66 the underground organization powering Germ a Kingdom which increases his physical capabilities and allows him to blend in with his environment 24 Though continued use of this suit awakened his inert genetic modifications he ultimately accepted these modifications giving him increased strength and speed but chose to destroy the Raid Suit to cut his ties to his family permanently 25 He would later use his new abilities with Armament Hak i to create Ifr it Jam be a more powerful version of Diable Jam be that uses blue white flames 26 Other than fighting skills Sanji is also a well renowned cook He learned to cook under Zef f on the Bara tie and has become quick and dexterous in his ability to use knives He also has a strong sense of taste and smell which is seen by being able to deduce the ingredients and being able to recreate the wedding cake on Whole Cake Island 27 During the time skip he develops Observation Hak i which allows him to sense the intent and presence of others such as when he was able to dodge a jelly bean bullet from Kata kuri 28 He is also able to utilize Armament Hak i which allows him to harden parts of his body and be able to attack Logia users 29 V in smoke Sanji V in sum ku Sanji was born as a prince of Germ a Kingdom a floating kingdom composed of several ships on the shells of large snails V in smoke Judge sought to regain the family's long lost glory by creating the strongest army using his expertise as a scientist to create hundreds of clones of his best soldiers Blinded by the pursuit of power he even experimented on his five children Sora who didn't like that they would practically become in human tried to undo said experiments by taking a powerful drug However amongst them only Sanji was affected by this being the only one without any powers and with the ability to feel emotions as such Judge heavily resented Sanji deeming him a failure and imprisoning him Sanji was also perpetually tortured and bullied by his brothers With help from his sister Rei ju he escapes and flees Germ a 66 On his way out Sanji encounters his father who demands him to keep his heritage a secret in shame
