Ēsu o Osou Kurohige no Yami\" (Japanese:最凶の能力! エースを襲う黒ひげの闇) Yoko Ikeda Hirohiko Kamisaka September 23, 2007(2007-09-23)[72] December 6, 2015\n\nThree days before theThousand Sunny'smaiden voyage, on Banaro Island, an island near Water 7, Blackbeard receives the news of the Straw Hats' devastation of Enies Lobby and decides to pursue them. However, his plans are interrupted by Ace, who has come to avenge a crewmate that was murdered by Blackbeard. Ordering his men back after failing to convince Ace to join his crew, Blackbeard justifies his actions because his crewmate was in possession of a Devil Fruit he long sought after. Blackbeard then reveals the power of the Dark-Dark Fruit by destroying the entire town. Blackbeard then overwhelms Ace, making him another offer to join his crew. Ace still refuses and the two unleash their strongest attacks on each other. The fight between these two pirates will later be known as the trigger for a massive incident that happens in the future.",
