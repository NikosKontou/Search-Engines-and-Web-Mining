Katana no Na wa Sogekingu?\" (Japanese:ゾロ新技炸裂! 刀の名はそげキング?) Hiroyuki Kakudō Yoshiyuki Suga December 10, 2006(2006-12-10)[36] February 22, 2015\n\nRefreshed after having placed three full bottles of cola in his stomach compartment, Franky turns the tide in his battle with Fukurou as they take their battle outside and in the sea current with Chopper watching before seeing a bloated Kumadori emerge from the fridge. With Fukuro attempting to keep him from escaping the current leading to the waterfall surrounding Enies Lobby's main island, Franky barely saves himself by grabbing Fukurou's leg and forces him to moon walk back up to the ground to resume their fight. A furious Fukuro instead attempts to kill Franky by crushing him against the Tower of Law, only for Franky to hold onto his opponent with his dividable legs and stop the momentum with his air pressure cannon before using the latter to propel his opponent to the ground. Back inside the Tower of Law, after Usopp attempts to have Kaku and Jabra fight each other, Zoro reveals his own plan by holding onto Usopp while he clings onto one of his swords.",
