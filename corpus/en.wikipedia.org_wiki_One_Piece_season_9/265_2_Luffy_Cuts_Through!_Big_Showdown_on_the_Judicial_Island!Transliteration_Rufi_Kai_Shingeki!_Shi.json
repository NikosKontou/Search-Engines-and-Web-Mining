Hiroyuki Kakudō Hirohiko Kamisaka June 4, 2006(2006-06-04)[12] August 3, 2014\n\nLuffy easily gets past the second gate, while the Franky Family and the Galley-La foremen, following their initial plan, break the first gate's defenses. All goes smoothly at first, but by the time the Franky Family's main force reaches the second gate, the marines have the giants Oimo(オイモ)and Kashi(カーシー,Kāshī)to take up their posts. Overmatched in strength and size, the Franky Family send their largest fighters, the Kairiki Destroyers(怪力デストロイヤーズ,Kairiki Desutoroiyāzu). However, even these overly large humans can do little against the giants' power and are quickly defeated. On the other side of the gate, Luffy faces the collective might of Enies Lobby's 10,000 men.",
