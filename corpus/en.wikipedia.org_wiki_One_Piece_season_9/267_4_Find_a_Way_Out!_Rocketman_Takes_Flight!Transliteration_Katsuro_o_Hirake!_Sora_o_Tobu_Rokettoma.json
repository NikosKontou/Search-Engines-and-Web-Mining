Yoshihiro Ueda Hirohiko Kamisaka June 18, 2006(2006-06-18)[14] August 17, 2014\n\nRobin and Franky are brought before Spandam, while Luffy blasts through waves of marines. The Galley-La foremen and the Franky Family eventually slip by Oimo and open the second gate. However, their joy is short-lived, as a group of marines closes the first gate behind them. To overcome the unanticipated obstacle,Zorochanges the plan. Yokozuna bends the island's outside fence downward. Using it as a ramp, the sea train jumps over both of the gates and crash lands into Oimo's back, finishing him off, and concluding everyone's arrival at the main island. As the marines' elite Law's Watch Dog Unit enters the now escalating fight.",
