But Puzzle captures Brindo and binds him with his chains to the mast. Elsewhere, while Usopp provoked Salchow by knocking out Arbelle with Sanji equally irate, Franky managed to beat Hockera with what cola he has left. However, after Franky returns to the Shark Submarine, the freezing pucks froze the sub solid as Hockera proceeds to take his captives to Lovely Land. As Lil accepts Robin's request to be led to Lovely Land, Zoro is aimlessly wandering inside the place as Don Accino demands progress from his eldest son Canpacino.",
