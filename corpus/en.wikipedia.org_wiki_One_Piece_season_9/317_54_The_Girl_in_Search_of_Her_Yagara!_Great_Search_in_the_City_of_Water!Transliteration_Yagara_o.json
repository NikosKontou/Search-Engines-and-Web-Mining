Yoshihiro Ueda Hirohiko Kamisaka July 8, 2007(2007-07-08)[64] September 27, 2015\n\nWhile searching for supplies, Luffy and Chopper are approached by a girl named Abi to search for her lost yagara bull Bluefin, who had appeared to her in a dream. During Aqua Laguna, Abi's family had left their 100-year-old yagara bull at home and they find him gone when their came back. With the exception of Abi, everyone believes that Bluefin is dead. Though Robin used her Devil Fruit powers to help them, the search all over the city with no success. The group come across a yagara who, as Chopper translated, heard Bluefin coming to someone's aid during Aqua Laguna.
