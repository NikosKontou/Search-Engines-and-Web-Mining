Hiroyuki Kakudō Yoshiyuki Suga August 19, 2007(2007-08-19)[67] October 18, 2015\n\nWhile the Galley-La foremen, Iceburg and Franky take a break after the Franky Family brings everyone a meal, Iceburg suggests to Franky that he joins the Straw Hats when they leave with the ship. Franky and Iceburg continue working through the night while the foremen pass out unable to keep up. Meanwhile, Usopp's first attempt to rejoin the Straw Hats fails. The next day, the Straw Hats find out from Kokoro that their Log Pose is pointing under the sea to Fishman Island and on the way they will have to pass through the Florian Triangle, where many ships have disappeared. Chimney, Gonbe, Kiwi and Mozu arrive with good news, their ship has been completed. The Franky Family suddenly show up with the bad news. Every Straw Hat as well as Usopp, as Sniper King and Franky now have bounties on each of their heads. The Franky Family fear their leader might end up getting captured again so they plea with Luffy to take Franky with him by any means.",
