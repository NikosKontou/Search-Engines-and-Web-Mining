Yoko Ikeda Hirohiko Kamisaka June 11, 2006(2006-06-11)[13] August 10, 2014\n\nThe Galley-La foremen and the leading members of the Franky Family arrive late at the second gate because they had to mount the Franky Family's king bulls(キングブル), sea dwelling animals that look like sea horses, on caterpillar tracks. Combining forces, they manage to pin down Kashi against a wall. Then, taunting Oimo, they goad him into accidentally knocking Kashi out. In the Tower of Law, Spandam receives an incomplete report about the number of people that Luffy took out, believing the enemy captain is not a threat. Lucci's party arrives and the CP9 celebrate their reunion with petty bickering and a contest of strength. Meanwhile, Luffy, defying resistance, makes his way towards the Courthouse Plaza.",
