Munehisa Sakai Hirohiko Kamisaka July 30, 2006(2006-07-30)[19] October 5, 2014\n\nThe Straw Hats storm the courthouse, where the remaining members of the Franky Family fight the three-headed judge Baskerville, and, aided by Yokozuna, block the building's entrance to cut off reinforcements. Above them, Luffy's Second Gear is put into action against Blueno, while his crew fight their way upstairs. On the main road, the giants have defeated the Law's Watch Dog Unit, and with Usopp and the Galley-La foremen are heading for the plaza. Luffy defeats Blueno, steps past his unconscious body, and cries out for Robin to hear that he has arrived.",
