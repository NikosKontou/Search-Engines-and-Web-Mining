Furankī Munen no Sakebi\" (Japanese:砲火に沈む島! フランキー無念の叫び) Hiroyuki Kakudō Koga Naoki April 29, 2007(2007-04-29)[54] July 12, 2015\n\nFranky and Robin finish throwing the last remaining marines off of their commandeered convoy ship when Kokoro, in mermaid form, jumps aboard with the rest of the Straw Hats, Chimney, and Gonbe, managing to survive their brush with a watery grave due to the shock of their rescuer's appearance. Kokoro explains that mermaids like her are able to walk on land after thirty years' time before everyone is happy to see Robin. The joyous reunion does not last long as Zoro, Usopp, and Franky see the inferno that was Enies Lobby. Zoro notes that they should remain in case the navy focuses on them while waiting for Luffy. As Sanji joins the group, one of the ships announces that the Straw Hats' accomplices has been wiped out along with the main gate. This breaks Franky's heart to hear his gang have been slaughtered as he yells for Luffy that he better not get himself killed. As the fleet turns its attention toward the Bridge of Hesitation, having managed to wound Lucci in the legs, Luffy decides to finish the fight in his Second Gear.",
