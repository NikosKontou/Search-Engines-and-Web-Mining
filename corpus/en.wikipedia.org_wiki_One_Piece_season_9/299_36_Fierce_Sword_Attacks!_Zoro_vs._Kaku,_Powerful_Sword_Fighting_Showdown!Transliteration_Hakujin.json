Luffy insists that Franky goes to save Robin. Reminded of himself when he was younger and tried to stop the sea train from carrying away his mentor, Franky agrees as Luffy attempts to ensure the cyborg's escape by restraining Lucci to no avail. At the same time, in the Tower of Law, Kaku shows Zoro the many tricks he can perform with his new Giraffe body that he got with his Devil Fruit powers, discovering new techniques in the process.
