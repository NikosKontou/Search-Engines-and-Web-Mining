Sanji and Zoro crush a building in the king bull's path and the party arrives at the courthouse. On the other side of the drawbridge, Spandam is brought a transponder snail phone with an urgent report. Confident that he will only be told of the Straw Hats' capture, he allows Robin and Franky to listen in, letting them know of their rescuers' success. In front of the courthouse, Zoro cuts open the building's immense stone door. The Franky Family split into three groups, two of which storm the drawbridge towers to reach the levelers at their tops. On the courthouse's roof, Luffy and Blueno fight on even terms until Luffy activates his newest technique, theSecond Gear.",
