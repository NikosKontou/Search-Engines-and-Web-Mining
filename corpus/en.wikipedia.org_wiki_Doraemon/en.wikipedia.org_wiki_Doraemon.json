rami is Doraemon's younger sister and De kisu gi is a gifted student boy who as Shizuka's close friend frequently attracts the jealousy of Nobita Doraemon was written and illustrated by Fuji ko F Fuji o the pen name of Japanese manga artist Hiroshi Fujimoto 5 6 7 According to Fuji o the series was originally conceived following a series of three events when searching for ideas for a new manga he wished a machine existed that would come up with ideas for him during this he tripped over his daughter's toy and heard cats fighting in his neighborhood 8 To set up the plot and characters he used some elements from his earlier manga series O bake no Q Tar which involve a no bake living with humans with a similar formula 9 Fuji o said that the idea for Doraemon came after an accumulation of trial and error during which he finally found the most suitable style of manga to him 10 Initially the series achieved little success as g ekiga was well known at the time and it only became a hit after its adaptation into an anime TV series and multiple feature films 9 Doraemon is mainly aimed at children so Fuji o chose to create the character with a simple graphic style based on shapes such as circles and ellipses 11 He used the same sequences of cartoons with regularity and continuity to enhance the reader's ease of understanding In addition blue a characteristic color of Doraemon was chosen as the main color in magazine publications which used to have a yellow cover and red title 12 Set in Tokyo the manga reflected parts of Japan's society such as the class system and the ideal of Japanese childhood 13 14 Problems if they occurred were resolved in a way so as not to rely on violence and eroticism 15 and the stories were integrated with the concept of environmentalism 16 The manga also insisted on the ethical values of integrity perseverance courage family and respect 17 In order to underline the crucial role of the younger generation in society the manga's creator chose to have the act carried out in a children's domain where young people can live with happiness freedom and power without adult interference 18 As Say a S Shirai shi noted the existence of the domain helped Doraemon to have a strong appeal in various Asian countries 18 During Doraemon's development Fuji o did not express a change in characters he said When a manga hero become a success the manga suddenly stops being interesting So the hero has to be like the stripes on a barber pole he seems to keep moving upward but actually he stays in the same place 19 According to Zensho I to Fuji o's former student the length of time in the universe is one of the ideas that inspired Fuji o to make Doraemon 20 Frequently displayed in its stories is Nobita's desire to control time and there exist time control gadgets that he uses to satisfy that desire particularly the Time Machine which lies in his desk drawer 21 Unlike Western works of science fiction the manga does not explain the theory nor the applied technology behind these tools but instead focusing on how the characters exploit them to their advantage making it more child friendly 22 The name Doraemon can be roughly translated to stray Unusually the name Doraemon is written in a mixture of two Japanese scripts katakana and hiragana Dora derives from dora neko stray cat and is a corruption of nora stray 8 while em on in kanji is an old fashioned suffix for male names for example as in Ishikawa Goemon 23 Nobita's home address in Tsuki mid a i moon view heights Nerima refers to Fuji mid a i Fuji view heights where Osamu Tezuka's residence and animation studio is based 13 The name Nobita Nobi refers to nobi nobi meaning the way a young child grows up free healthy and happy unrestrained in any sense 13 24 Gadgets or him its u d gu are Doraemon's tools from the future used to assist the characters Fuji o said that Doraemon has a total of 1 293 gadgets 25 according to a 2004 analysis by Yasuyuki Yokoyama of Toyama University there are 1 963 gadgets found in 1 344 sketches 23 The most recurring gadgets include Take Copter a small piece of headgear made out of bamboo that can allow its users to fly Time Machine a machine used for time travel Anywhere Door a pink colored door that allows people to travel according to the thoughts of the person who turns the knob Time Kerchief a handkerchief which can turn an object new or old or a person young or old Translator Tool a cuboid jelly that allows one to converse in any language and Designer a camera used to instantly dress up the user 23 26 Say a S Shirai shi wrote that most of the gadgets were an impressive testimony to the standards of quality control and innovation that exist in the twenty second century 26 The gadgets are an essential part of the series so as to reflect a positive point of view concerning the association of technology in children and to express the wishes of modern society 27 The series ceased its original run in 1994 and was not given an ending before Fujimoto's death in 1996 this has since aroused numerous urban legends throughout the years 28 One of the most well known endings of the manga was by an amateur manga cartoonist under the pen name Ya sue T Tajima first appearing on the Internet in 1998 and made into a manga in 2005 The story takes place when Doraemon's battery dies and Nobita later grows up becoming a robot engineer potentially reviving Doraemon and live a happy life Tajima issued an apology making his own ending in 2007 and the profits were shared with Sho gaku kan and the copyright owner Fuji ko F Fuji o Pro 29 Ry ichi Ya gi and Takashi Yamazaki the directors of Stand by Me Doraemon confirmed that it had only one opening while the ending has been rewritten several times 30
