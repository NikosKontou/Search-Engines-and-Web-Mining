[ 269 ] JD relaunched PaiPai.com as PaiPai Second Hand ( 拍拍二手 ) to compete alongside 58 Tongcheng's Zhuanzhuan.com, both partially owned by Tencent, against Alibaba's Xianyu in the second-hand e-commerce market. [ 270 ] [ 271 ]\n\nTencent was reported in 2017 to be working with China's Central Bank to develop a central payments clearing platform for online payments. [ 272 ]\n\nOn 31 December 2021, it was reported Tencent had bought a stake in the UK digital bank, Monzo . [ 273 ] [ 274 ]\n\nIn March 2006, Tencent launched its search engine Soso.com (搜搜; to search). [ 275 ] [ 276 ] On 1 October 2012, it was the 33rd most visited website in the world, 11th most visited in China, as well as the 8th most visited website in South Korea, according to Alexa Internet . [ 277 ] It was also a Chinese partner of Google , using AdWords . [ 278 ] In September 2013, Tencent discontinued Soso.com after it invested in Sogou and replaced Soso.com with Sogou Search as its main search engine. [ 279 ]\n\nIn 2008, Tencent released a media player, available for free download, under the name QQ Player . [ 280 ] Tencent also launched Tencent Traveler, a web browser based on Trident . It became the third most-visited browser in China in 2008. [ 281 ] [ 282 ]\n\nQQ Haiwai is Tencent's first venture into international real estate listings and information and is the result of a partnership with Chinese international real estate website Juwai.com. Haiwai was announced at Tencent's annual regional summit in Beijing on 21 December 2016. [ 283 ] [ 284 ]\n\nIn 2017, Tencent launched its own credit score system called Tencent Credit, with a process similar to that of Sesame Credit, operated by its competitor, the Alibaba Group, through its subsidiary Ant Financial. [ 285 ]\n\nTencent has created WeChat Intelligent Healthcare, Tencent Doctorwork, and AI Medical Innovation System (AIMIS) [ 286 ] Tencent Doctorwork has also merged with Trusted Doctors [ 287 ]\n\nTencent officially commences operations of its first insurance agency platform, WeSure Internet Insurance Ltd. (WeSure), to work with domestic insurance companies such as Ping An Insurance . [ 288 ]\n\nIn August 2017, Tencent released AI Medical Innovation System (AIMIS) [ 289 ] or Miying [ 290 ] (觅影 in Chinese), which has two core competencies: AI medical imaging and AI-assisted diagnosis. The AI Medical Innovation System (AIMIS) is capable of helping doctors screen for various diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, lung cancer, and esophageal cancer, through its AI-assisted medical image analysis. Its AI-assisted medical diagnosis engine enables doctors to identify and estimate the risk of over 700 diseases, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of diagnoses. The system is currently undergoing clinical validation in more than 100 major hospitals in China. It has already assisted doctors in interpreting over 100 million medical images and has served nearly one million patients. Tencent's data indicates that recognition accuracy reaches 90% for esophageal cancer, 97% for diabetic retinopathy, and 97.2% for colorectal cancer. Overall, Chinese medical institutions and companies are adopting a proactive approach toward AI. Nearly 80% of hospitals and medical enterprises plan to implement or have already implemented medical AI applications, and more than 75% of hospitals believe that these applications will become widespread in the future. [ 291 ]\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic , Tencent helped source 1.2 million protective masks for American medical staff combating the virus. [ 292 ]\n\nOn 27 March 2020, a co-innovation lab was launched by Tencent who will be in collaborations with Huawei in developing a cloud-based game platform by tapping into Huawei's Kunpeng processor's power to build Tencent's GameMatrix cloud game platform. Along with further exploration in the possibilities of artificial intelligence and augmented reality elements in game. [ 293 ]\n\nIn October 2020, Tencent's AIMIS Image Cloud was introduced. [ 294 ] AIMIS Image Cloud was designed to help patients manage their medical images and give permission to medical professionals to access their exams and reports. The AIMIS platform supports full images on the cloud to reduce repeated exams. It can also connect medical institutions at all levels through cloud based Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS), allowing patients to take examinations in primary medical institutions and obtain expert diagnosis remotely. Doctors can conduct online consultations through Tencent real-time audio and video facilities when they encounter difficult cases and work collaboratively on images to communicate more efficiently. [ 294 ]\n\nOn 26 May 2020, Tencent announced it planned to invest 500 billion yuan (US$70 billion) over the next five years in new digital infrastructure, a major hi-tech initiative that would bolster Beijing's efforts to drive economic recovery in the post-coronavirus era. [ 295 ]\n\nTencent received the Zero Project Award 2023 for innovative ICT solutions for persons with disabilities. Originating from Tencent's game development, MTGPA (Magic Tencent Game Performance Amelioration) Haptics is transmitting vibro-tactile signals to the user which support orientation and notification. Typical customers are persons with visual impairments or the elderly. [ 296 ] Connected to the Tencent Map app, MTGPA Haptics guides customers indoors and outdoors through long and short vibrations in case of deviations from the planned route. [ 296 ]\n\nTencent announced its WeCity project in 2019, through which it seeks to develop a smart city solution for digital governance, urban management and decision-making, and industrial interconnections. [ 297 ] : 65 In June 2020, Tencent has unveiled plans for an urban development dubbed \"Net City\", [ 297 ] : 65 a 21-million-square-foot development, equivalent in size to Monaco, in Shenzhen. The development will be built on reclaimed land . [ 297 ] : 65 It will prioritize pedestrians, green spaces and self-driving vehicles, corporate offices, schools, sports facilities, parks, retail space and apartments, according to the project's architect, NBBJ . [ 298 ] [ 299 ]\n\nAt the end of June 2020, Tencent has increased its direct stake in Nio to 15.1% after acquiring more of the Chinese electric vehicle maker's New York-listed shares recently. [ 300 ] Tencent spent $10 million to buy 1.68 million American Depositary Shares earlier in the month, according to Nio's latest filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Shenzhen-based social media and entertainment conglomerate also controls another 16% stake in Nio's ADSs through three of its units. Tencent was the second-largest Nio shareholder in terms of voting rights after Li Bin, founder of the automaker, who held 13.8% in shares but 47% voting rights, according to a March filing by the company. As of 8 July, they bought another amount of shares increasing their stake in Nio to 16.3%.\n\nTencent's largest shareholder is Prosus (majority owned by Naspers ), which owns 25.6% of all shares [ 3 ] and hence is the controlling shareholder . [ 301 ] However, Ma Huateng , co-founder of Tencent, still owns a significant stake (8.42%).\n\nTencent's headquarters is currently the Tencent Binhai Mansion , also known as the Tencent Seafront Towers, which is located in Shenzhen 's Nanshan District . [ 302 ] In addition to its headquarters in Shenzhen, Tencent also has offices in Beijing , Shanghai , Chengdu , and Guangzhou . [ 303 ]\n\nTencent has a unitary board consisting of Tencent co-founder, CEO , and chairman Ma Huateng , also known as Pony Ma , executive director and President of Tencent Martin Lau, non-executive directors Jacobus \"Koos\" Bekker and Charles Searle of Naspers , and independent non-executive directors Li Dongsheng, Iain Bruce, Ian Stone, and Yang Siushun. [ 304 ] Tencent's governance is aided by its Strategy Department, commonly known as SD, which provides business analytics for the corporation's various divisions. [ 305 ]\n\nTencent has at least four Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises and nearly twenty subsidiaries. [ 31 ]\n\nA software development unit that has created, among others, Tencent Traveler and later versions of QQ IM, [ 306 ] as well as some mobile software . [ 307 ] This subsidiary is located on the Southern District of Hi-Tech Park, Shenzhen. [ 306 ] It also holds a number of patents related to instant messaging and massively multiplayer online game gaming. [ 308 ]\n\nIn 2023, an entity controlled by the state-owned China Internet Investment Fund took a golden share investment in Shenzhen Yayue Technology. [ 309 ] The stock price of Tencent sank when news of the deal was published. [ 310 ]\n\nIn 2007, Tencent invested over RMB100 million in the establishment of the Tencent Research Institute, which became China's first research center dedicated to core Internet technologies. [ 311 ] The campuses are located in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. [ 312 ]\n\nIn 2012, Tencent launched Tencent YouTu Lab, an AI research department that focuses on computer vision, including optical character recognition (OCR), image understanding, and generation. [ 313 ] [ 314 ]\n\nIn 2020, as part of Tencent's efforts to combat the COVID-19 and future pandemic, Tencent established an AI Joint Lab with respiratory disease expert Zhong Nanshan to conduct research on disease screening, prevention, and outbreak warnings. [ 315 ]\n\nIn 2023, Tencent debuted its large language model Hunyuan for enterprise use. [ 316 ] In 2023, Tencent announced its partnership with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) to establish a Digital Seed Bank at the Tencent Science and Technology Museum. [ 317 ]\n\nThe Chinese government views Tencent as one of its national champion corporations. [ 318 ] : 156–157\n\nFor the occasion of the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party , Tencent released a mobile game titled \"Clap for Xi Jinping : An Awesome Speech\", in which players have 19 seconds to generate as many claps as possible for the party leader. [ 319 ]\n\nIn August 2019, it was reported that Tencent collaborated with the propaganda department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Daily to develop \"patriotic games\". [ 320 ] [ 321 ]\n\nIn a December 2020 article in Foreign Policy , a former senior official of the Central Intelligence Agency stated that the CIA concluded that Tencent received funding from the Ministry of State Security early on in its foundation. This was said to be a \"seed investment\" that was provided \"when they were trying to build out the Great Firewall and the monitoring technology.\" Tencent denied this allegation. [ 322 ]\n\nIn 2021, it was reported that Tencent and Ant Group were working with the People's Bank of China to develop a Central bank digital currency . [ 323 ] [ 324 ]\n\nIn June 2022, Tencent partnered with Shanghai United Media Group to launch a plan to develop domestic and foreign influencers . [ 325 ]\n\nTencent participates in many carbon reduction programs and partnerships. [ 326 ] Tencent's Global Carbon Neutral Technology Alliance shares carbon neutrality patents and technologies for free and includes competitors like Alibaba and Microsoft. [ 326 ] Tencent's CarbonX Program is a business accelerator and digital capability program which aims to develop low-carbon technologies. [ 326 ] In December 2022, Tencent launched TanLIVE, a climate a co-developed platform which aims to bring together resources for climate change solutions in China. [ 327 ]\n\nTencent participates in the Science Based Targets initiative launched by the UN Global Compact, which provides a platform for setting science-based net-zero targets. [ 326 ] In 2022, Tencent established a goal of making the company and its supply chain carbon neutral . [ 328 ]\n\nMany of Tencent's software and services share similarities to those of competitors, [ 329 ] [ 330 ] [ 331 ] [ 332 ] [ 333 ] [ 334 ] and to their own. [ 335 ] The founder and chairman , Huateng \"Pony\" Ma , famously said, \"[To] copy is not evil.\" A former CEO and president of SINA.com , Wang Zhidong , said, \" Pony Ma is a notorious king of copying.\" Jack Ma of Alibaba Group stated, \"The problem with Tencent is the lack of innovation; all of their products are copies.\" [ 336 ]\n\nIn 1996, an Israeli company named Mirabilis released one of the first stand alone instant messaging clients named ICQ . [ 337 ] Three years later, Tencent released a copied version of ICQ, naming it OICQ, which stands for Open ICQ. [ 338 ] After losing a lawsuit against AOL , which bought ICQ in 1998, for violating ICQ's intellectual property rights , Tencent released a new version of OICQ in December 2000 and rebranded it QQ . [ 339 ] With its model of free-to-use and charging for customizing personal avatars, QQ hit 50 million users in its second year, 856 million users and at most 45.3 million synchronous users in 2008. [ 338 ]\n\nDuring early stages of company development and expansion, Tencent has been widely accused of stealing ideas from its competitors and creating counterfeit copies of their products. [ 340 ] [ 339 ] Some of the criticisms aimed at Tencent in this regard are that QQ farm was a direct copy of Happy Farm , QQ dance originated from Audition Online , and that QQ speed featured gameplay highly similar to Crazyracing Kartrider . [ 341 ] In January 2023, Tencent's trailer for their new MMORPG, Tarisland , was said to resemble Blizzard 's World of Warcraft . [ 342 ] In July 2025, Tencent had been sued by Sony Interactive Entertainment because one of their games Light of Motiram heavily resembled Horizon Zero Dawn in terms of setting, protagonist, storyline, themes and gameplay.\n\nIn general, Tencent does not seek to acquire controlling stakes when it invests in other companies. [ 71 ] : 93 It usually deems minority ownership sufficient to build connections and acquire technology. [ 71 ] : 93\n\nIn a partial effort to rebuild the reputation of Tencent lost from allegations of copying, Tencent adjusted its strategy by aggressively investing in the acquisition of other companies, rather than in the replication of them. By 2020, Tencent had invested in over 800 companies across the world. [ 340 ] During 2012 and 2019, under the direction of President Martin Lau, Tencent has invested from minority stakes to majority stakes in world-wide-famous game companies such as Riot Games , Epic Games , Activision Blizzard , SuperCell , and Bluehole . [ 343 ] While aggressive acquisitions may benefit Tencent due to factors such as reduction in competition and monopolization, it may not benefit the acquired companies in terms of their growth and innovation. Colin Huang, founder of Pinduoduo, said \"Tencent won't die when Pinduoduo dies, because it has tens of thousands of sons.\" [ 344 ]\n\nIn 2015, security testing firms AV-Comparatives , AV-TEST and Virus Bulletin jointly decided to remove Tencent from their software whitelists . The Tencent products supplied for testing were found to contain optimisations that made the software appear less exploitable when benchmarked but actually provided greater scope for delivering exploits. [ 345 ] Additionally, software settings were detrimental to end-users protection if used. Qihoo was later also accused of cheating, while Tencent was accused of actively gaming the anti-malware tests. [ 346 ] [ 347 ]\n\nThe United States Department of Defense added Tencent to its list of entities associated with the Chinese military in January 2025; such companies are either considered to be either controlled by the Chinese military or serve the growth of China's civil-military complex. The listing is primarily an advisory, having no direct impact, but nominally is considered a blacklisting. Tencent representatives said the listing was \"clearly a mistake\" and will have no impact on their business but plan to appeal the listing. [ 348 ]\n\nSince 2018, Tencent has been in litigation with ByteDance . [ 71 ] : 109 ByteDance and its affiliates brought a series of unfair competition lawsuits against Tencent, alleging that Tencent was blocking their content. [ 71 ] : 109 As of at least early 2024, these lawsuits had not reached resolution, largely due to disputes about jurisdiction. [ 71 ] : 109 Tencent filed two lawsuits against ByteDance and its affiliates, alleging that they were using WeChat and QQ profiles without authorization and illegally crawling data from public WeChat accounts. [ 71 ] : 109 Tencent obtained an injunction barring ByteDance from this practice. [ 71 ] : 109\n\nTencent's WeChat platform has been accused of blocking TikTok videos and the censorship of politically sensitive content. [ 349 ] [ 350 ] [ 351 ] In April 2018, TikTok sued Tencent and accused it of spreading false and damaging information on its WeChat platform, demanding RMB 1 million in compensation and an apology. In June 2018, Tencent filed a lawsuit against Toutiao and TikTok in a Beijing court, alleging they had repeatedly defamed Tencent with negative news and damaged its reputation, seeking a nominal sum of RMB 1 million in compensation and a public apology. [ 352 ] In response, Toutiao filed a complaint the following day against Tencent for allegedly unfair competition and asking for RMB 90 million in economic losses. [ 353 ]\n\nHowever, Tim Sweeney , the CEO and founder of Epic Games , maker of the popular game Fortnite , tweeted that his company would never follow suit and punish people for expressing their opinions, even though Tencent is a 40% stakeholder in Epic. [ 354 ] In a statement, Sweeney said it would \"never happen on [his] watch\", and emphasized that Epic is an American company, implying that it would not compromise an ethos of free speech to curry favor with Chinese authorities in the pursuit of maximum profit. [ 355 ]\n\nLater in October 2019, Tencent announced it would stop broadcasting Houston Rockets NBA games in China due to a tweet made by Daryl Morey , general manager of the Rockets, that was supportive of protestors in the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests . Although Morey's tweet was hastily deleted, news of it was quickly reported all around the world, and the NBA went on to spend months attempting damage control in China. [ 356 ]\n\nIn December 2019, the Chinese government ordered Tencent to improve the firm's user data rules for its apps, which regulators regarded to be in violation of censorship rules. [ 357 ]\n\nIn January 2021, a proposed class action lawsuit was filed in California against Tencent, alleging user censorship and surveillance via WeChat . [ 358 ]\n\nIn November 2022, Sustainalytics downgraded Tencent to \"non-compliant\" with the United Nations Global Compact principles due to complicity with censorship. [ 359 ]\n\nOn 6 August 2020, President Donald Trump signed two executive orders , one directed at TikTok and one at WeChat. The TikTok order dictated that within 45 days from its signing (20 September 2020) that it would ban transactions involving the TikTok app with ByteDance, effectively banning the TikTok app in the United States, under threat of penalty. TikTok sued Trump over the executive order, which was later revoked under Joe Biden 's administration , causing the lawsuit to be dismissed in July 2021. The order for WeChat contained the same information but targeting the WeChat app and related transactions for Tencent. In the case of ByteDance, the order would be canceled should an American company acquire it, which Microsoft had been openly spoken of, but there are unlikely any immediate buyers for Tencent in the U.S. [ 360 ] Los Angeles Times reporter Sam Dean affirmed from the White House that this does not affect other facets of Tencent's ownerships in American companies such as with its video game companies. [ 361 ] [ 362 ]\n\nIn December 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that Tencent had removed two directors from Epic Games' board of directors and relinquished its unilateral right to appoint directors or observers to Epic's board. This action followed concerns that interlocking directorates between the Epic and Tencent boards violated U.S. antitrust law under Section 8 of the Clayton Act . [ 363 ] [ 364 ]",
