312 In 2012 Tencent launched Tencent You Tu Lab an A I research department that focuses on computer vision including optical character recognition OCR image understanding and generation 313 314 In

screening prevention and outbreak warnings 315 In 2023 Tencent debuted its large language model Hun yuan for enterprise use 316 In 2023 Tencent announced its partnership with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences CA AS to establish a Digital Seed Bank at the Tencent Science and Technology Museum 317 The Chinese government views Tencent as one of its national champion corporations 318 156 157 For the occasion of the 19 th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Tencent released a mobile game titled Clap for Xi J in ping An Awesome Speech in which players have 19 seconds to generate as many claps as possible for the party leader 319 In August 2019 it was reported that Tencent collaborated with the propaganda department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Daily to develop patriotic games 320 321 In a December 2020 article in Foreign Policy a former senior official of the Central Intelligence Agency stated that the CIA concluded that Tencent received funding from the Ministry of State Security early on in its foundation This was said to be a seed investment that was provided when they were trying to build out the Great Firewall and the monitoring technology Tencent denied this allegation 322 In 2021 it was reported that Tencent and Ant Group were working with the People's Bank of China to develop a Central bank digital currency 323 324 In June 2022 Tencent partnered with Shanghai United Media Group to launch a plan to develop domestic and foreign influence rs 325 Tencent participates in many carbon reduction programs and partnerships 326 Tencent's Global Carbon Neutral Technology Alliance shares carbon neutrality patents and technologies for free and includes competitors like Ali baba and Microsoft 326 Tencent's Carbon X Program is a business accelerator and digital capability program which aims to develop low carbon technologies 326 In December 2022 Tencent launched Tan LIVE a climate a co developed platform which aims to bring together resources for climate change solutions in China 327 Tencent participates in the Science Based Targets initiative launched by the UN Global Compact which provides a platform for setting science based net zero targets 326 In 2022 Tencent established a goal of making the company and its supply chain carbon neutral 328 Many of Tencent's software and services share similarities to those of competitors 329 330 331 332 333 334 and to their own 335 The founder and chairman Hua teng Pony Ma famously said To copy is not evil A former CEO and president of S IN A com Wang Zhi dong said Pony Ma is a notorious king of copying Jack Ma of Ali baba Group stated The problem with Tencent is the lack of innovation all of their products are copies 336 In 1996 an Israeli company named Mirabilis released one of the first stand alone instant messaging clients named ICQ 337 Three years later Tencent released a copied version of ICQ naming it O ICQ which stands for Open ICQ 338 After losing a lawsuit against AOL which bought ICQ in 1998 for violating ICQ's intellectual property rights Tencent released a new version of O ICQ in December 2000 and rebranded it QQ 339 With its model of free to use and charging for customizing personal avatars QQ hit 50 million users in its second year 856 million users and at most 45 3 million synchronous users in 2008 338 During early stages of company development and expansion Tencent has been widely accused of stealing ideas from its competitors and creating counterfeit copies of their products 340 339 Some of the criticisms aimed at Tencent in this regard are that QQ farm was a direct copy of Happy Farm QQ dance originated from Audition Online and that QQ speed featured gameplay highly similar to Crazy racing Kart rider 341 In January 2023 Tencent's trailer for their new MMORPG Tar island was said to resemble Blizzard's World of Warcraft 342 In July 2025 Tencent had been sued by Sony Interactive Entertainment because one of their games Light of Mot i ram heavily resembled Horizon Zero Dawn in terms of setting protagonist storyline themes and gameplay In general Tencent does not seek to acquire controlling stakes when it invests in other companies 71 93 It usually deems minority ownership sufficient to build connections and acquire technology 71 93 In a partial effort to rebuild the reputation of Tencent lost from allegations of copying Tencent adjusted its strategy by aggressively investing in the acquisition of other companies rather than in the replication of them By 2020 Tencent had invested in over 800 companies across the world 340 During 2012 and 2019 under the direction of President Martin Lau Tencent has invested from minority stakes to majority stakes in world wide famous game companies such as Riot Games Epic Games Activision Blizzard SuperCell and Blue hole 343 While aggressive acquisitions may benefit Tencent due to factors such as reduction in competition and monopolization it may not benefit the acquired companies in terms of their growth and innovation Colin Huang founder of Pin duo duo said Tencent won't die when Pin duo duo dies because it has tens of thousands of sons 344 In 2015 security testing firms AV Comparatives AV TEST and Virus Bulletin jointly decided to remove Tencent from their software white lists The Tencent products supplied for testing were found to contain optimisation s that made the software appear less exploit able when benchmarked but actually provided greater scope for delivering exploits 345 Additionally software settings were detrimental to end users protection if used Qi hoo was later also accused of cheating while Tencent was accused of actively gaming the anti malware tests 346 347 The United States Department of Defense added Tencent to its list of entities associated with the Chinese military in January 2025 such companies are either considered to be either controlled by the Chinese military or serve the growth of China's civil military complex The listing is primarily an advisory having no direct impact but nominally is considered a blacklisting Tencent representatives said the listing was clearly a mistake and will have no impact on their business but plan to appeal the listing 348 Since 2018 Tencent has been in litigation with Byte Dance 71 109 Byte Dance and its affiliates brought a series of unfair competition lawsuits against Tencent alleging that Tencent was blocking their content 71 109 As of at least early 2024 these lawsuits had not reached resolution largely due to disputes about jurisdiction 71 109 Tencent filed two lawsuits against Byte Dance and its affiliates alleging that they were using We Chat and QQ profiles without authorization and illegally crawling data from public We Chat accounts 71 109 Tencent obtained an injunction barring Byte Dance from this practice 71 109 Tencent's We Chat platform has been accused of blocking Tik Tok videos and the censorship of politically sensitive content 349 350 351 In April 2018 Tik Tok sued Tencent and accused it of spreading false and damaging information on its We Chat platform demanding R MB 1 million in compensation and an apology In June 2018 Tencent filed a lawsuit against To u tiao and Tik Tok in a Beijing court alleging they had repeatedly defamed Tencent with negative news and damaged its reputation seeking a nominal sum of R MB 1 million in compensation and a public apology 352 In response To u tiao filed a complaint the following day against Tencent for allegedly unfair competition and asking for R MB 90 million in economic losses 353 However Tim Sweeney the CEO and founder of Epic Games maker of the popular game Fort nite tweeted that his company would never follow suit and punish people for expressing their opinions even though Tencent is a 40 stake holder in Epic 354 In a statement Sweeney said it would never happen on his watch and emphasized that Epic is an American company implying that it would not compromise an ethos of free speech to curry favor with Chinese authorities in the pursuit of maximum profit 355 Later in October 2019 Tencent announced it would stop broadcasting Houston Rockets NBA games in China due to a tweet made by Daryl Morey general manager of the Rockets that was supportive of protestors in the 2019 2020 Hong Kong protests Although Morey's tweet was hastily deleted news of it was quickly reported all around the world and the NBA went on to spend months attempting damage control in China 356 In December 2019 the Chinese government ordered Tencent to improve the firm's user data rules for its apps which regulators regarded to be in violation of censorship rules 357 In January 2021 a proposed class action lawsuit was filed in California against Tencent alleging user censorship and surveillance via We Chat 358 In November 2022 Sustain aly tics downgraded Tencent to non compliant with the United Nations Global Compact principles due to complicity with censorship 359 On 6 August 2020 President Donald Trump signed two executive orders one directed at Tik Tok and one at We Chat The Tik Tok order dictated that within 45 days from its signing 20 September 2020 that it would ban transactions involving the Tik Tok app with Byte Dance effectively banning the Tik Tok app in the United States under threat of penalty Tik Tok sued Trump over the executive order which was later revoked under Joe Biden's administration causing the lawsuit to be dismissed in July 2021 The order for We Chat contained the same information but targeting the We Chat app and related transactions for Tencent In the case of Byte Dance the order would be canceled should an American company acquire it which Microsoft had been openly spoken of but there are unlikely any immediate buyers for Tencent in the U S 360 Los Angeles Times reporter Sam Dean affirmed from the White House that this does not affect other facets of Tencent's ownerships in American companies such as with its video game companies 361 362 In December 2024 the U S Department of Justice announced that Tencent had removed two directors from Epic Games ' board of directors and relinquished its unilateral right to appoint directors or observers to Epic's board This action followed concerns that interlocking directorates between the Epic and Tencent boards violated U S antitrust law under Section 8 of the Clayton Act 363 364",
