Masaru-san ; lit. \"Sexy Commando Side Story: That's Amazing!! Mr. Masaru\") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kyosuke Usuta . It was serialized in Shueisha 's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1995 to 1997, with its chapters collected in seven tankōbon volumes. An anime television series adaptation, consisting of 48 episodes of seven minutes each, animated by Magic Bus and directed by Akitaro Daichi , was broadcast on TBS 's late night programming block Wonderful [ ja ] in 1998.\n\nWakame High School's extracurricular Sexy Commando Club consists of 5–6 male members including the principal, a female manager, and a small mysterious pet. The strange art of Sexy Commando (which extends back to Japan's Muromachi period ) is a martial one; however, instead of focusing on how to defeat an opponent with physical force, the art focuses on how to distract the opponent to the point he is unable to fight. There are many techniques, though the club tends to favor the unzipping of the trousers technique, known as Erīze no Yūutsu ( エリーゼのゆううつ ) . The club fills up with an eccentric and quirky crowd as it gains popularity.\n\nWritten and illustrated by Kyosuke Usuta , Sexy Commando Gaiden was serialized in Shueisha 's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from November 1995 to September 1997.

[ 2 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ]\n\nSexy Commando Gaiden is considered a hit in Japan; its seven volumes have sold over 7 million copies. [ 15 ] It ranked eighth on a 2016 poll of the \"strongest\" gag manga to ever appear in Weekly Shōnen Jump , conducted by Goo Ranking website. [ 16 ]\n\nJonathan Bethune in Publishers Weekly said, \"Usuta's writing consistently avoids the obvious gags found in typical shonen comedy and instead challenges readers with its clever satire and wit.\" [ 1 ] Commenting on the anime adaptation, Justin Sevakis of Anime News Network called the series Akitaro Daichi's magnum opus in terms of \"ridiculous, spastic comedy\".
