started as a collaboration between four Indonesian media groups at the urging of Information Minister Ali Mur topo and politician Jus uf Wan and i After the first issue was printed on 25 April 1983 it spent several years with minimal advertisements and increasing circulation After a change in chief editors in 1991 it began to take a more vocal pro democracy point of view The paper was one of the few Indonesian English language dailies to survive the 1997 Asian financial crisis and currently has a circulation of about 40 000 The Jakarta Post also features an online edition and a weekend magazine supplement called J The newspaper is targeted at foreigners and educated Indonesians although the middle class Indonesian readership has increased Noted for being a training ground for local and international reporters The Jakarta Post has won several awards and has been described as being Indonesia's leading English language daily 1 The Jakarta Post is a member of the Asia News Network The Jakarta Post was the brainchild of Information Minister Ali Mur topo and politician Jus uf Wan and i who were disappointed at the perceived bias against Indonesia in foreign news sources 2 At the time there were two English language dailies in the country The Indonesia Times and The Indonesian Observer 3 However as these existing papers were poorly perceived by the public they decided to create a new one To ensure credibility the two convinced a group of competing newspapers the Gol kar backed Su ara Kary a the Catholic owned Kom pas the Protestant owned S in ar Hara pan and the weekly Tempo to back the nascent paper 2 They hoped it would become a quality English language paper in Southeast Asia similar to The Straits Times in Singapore the Bangkok Post as well as the now defunct The Nation in Thailand as well as The Star the now defunct The Malay Mail and New Straits Times in Malaysia 4 After PT Bin a Media Tenggara decided to back the paper 5 Wan and i spent several months contacting influential figures at the competing newspapers In exchange for their cooperation Kom pas requested a 25 percent share in the new newspaper for which it would handle the daily business operations such as printing circulation and advertising Tempo offered to assist with management in return for a 15 percent share while Saba m Si agian of S in ar Hara pan was hired as the first chief editor for which S in ar Hara pan received stock The establishment of the paper was further aided by incoming Information Minister Harm ok o who received five percent interest for his role in acquiring a license In total the start up cost Rp 500 million US 700 000 at the time 6 Muhammad Chu dori a co founder of The Jakarta Post who formerly reported for Antara became the newspaper's first general manager 7 Further details including S in ar Hara pan's share of stock and the paper's publisher were decided at a meeting at Wan and i's office in March 1983 8 The next month on 25 April the first edition totalling eight pages was published 9 The first newsroom of the new paper was located in Kom pas's former laundry room a one story warehouse the first employees had to do the layout by hand using pica poles as straight edges 10 During the first few months the writers translated and recycled previously published stories from Indonesian media which were later picked up by foreign wire services Original reporting was rare at first as the editors did not want to deal with the censorship of Suharto's New Order government 11 In the early years of its publication The Jakarta Post had difficulty attracting advertisers to the point that some editions ran without ads 12 However circulation increased dramatically from 8 657 in 1983 to 17 480 in 1988 Although it was originally hoped that the paper would begin to turn a profit within the first three years the recession in the early 1980 sled to the start up funds being depleted Eventually in 1985 the paper took out an interest free loan and received Rp 700 million from its owners After advertising increased The Jakarta Post was able to turn a profit by 1988 13 and was considered one of the most credible newspapers in Indonesia 14 Susan to Pu dj omar to no the former chief editor of Tempo became The Jakarta Post's second chief editor on 1 August 1991 after Si agian was chosen to be Indonesia's ambassador to Australia 15 Under Pu dj omar to no's leadership the paper began publishing more original work and doing less translation reporters were also asked to take a more active role in the day to day operations of the paper 16 The paper also became more vocal regarding politics taking a pro democracy stance like Tempo 16 17 It soon converted its offices into a new two story building built using the Kom pas pension fund 18 and expanded to 12 pages 19 In 1994 The Jakarta Post signed a distribution agreement with the British news service Reuters and the American Dialog Information Services allowing its stories to be more easily promoted overseas 20 By the mid 1990 s it had established a workshop to assist its new foreign born staff in learning the local culture 21 By December 1998 The Jakarta Post had a circulation of 41 049 20 and was one of the few English language dailies in Indonesia after the 1997 Asian financial crisis 22 six other English language dailies had failed 23 That year it also became a founding member of the Asia News Network 24 The Jakarta Post officially endorsed the Jo ko Wi dodo Jus uf K all a ticket in the 2014 Indonesian presidential election 25 their first time doing so in its 31 year history 26 Kom pas noted that it was the first time official support for a presidential candidate by a media outlet in Indonesia 27 The Press Council considered The

piece criticising IS IL 31 The newspaper has a partnership agreement in place with state media outlet China Daily to re post its content 32 The Jakarta Post in 2020 was one of eight news publishers

Sunday edition ceased publication in April 2016 It was replaced by a lifestyle and culture magazine called J which is included with the newspaper's Saturday edition 38 The Jakarta Post features an online edition which includes both print and internet exclusive stories that are free to access There are also news flashes that are developed as they happen The paper hopes to digit is e the entirety

Pu dj omar to no's leadership it began targeting more Indonesian readers 18 As of 2009 update approximately half of its 40 000 readers were middle class Indonesians 23 In 1996 The Jakarta Post faced invigorated competition when media tycoon Peter Gon th a bought a controlling stake in rival paper The Indonesian Observer and revamped the publication 42 However The Indonesian Observer was unable to match The Jakarta Post's quality of independent reporting because of Gon th a's business connections to the Suharto family He stopped printing The Indonesian Observer in June 2001 43 In 2008 The Jakarta Post faced new competition dubbed a wake up call when Be rita Satu Media Holdings an associated company of billionaire James Ria dy began publishing a rival English language daily newspaper the Jakarta Globe 44 The Jakarta Globe even hired several defectors from The Jakarta Post paying them higher salaries and the Globe's print run was 40 000 45 However by May 2012 The Jakarta Globe

Rp 7 500 in Jakarta and Rp 9 500 in Bali and Nusa Tenggara As of 2018 subscriptions cost US 11 month for the online version and US 12 month for the printed version 40 The Jakarta Post follows a broadsheet format In the beginning it featured an index on the front page as well as short offbeat stories under the title This Odd World The lifestyle section had eight comic strips and it used more photographs and graphics than was normal for Indonesian publications at that time The editorials tended to be shorter than their Indonesian counterparts 11 The Jakarta Post uses the inverted pyramid style of reporting with the most important information at the beginning of the article 14 during the 1980 s many Indonesian papers put the lead further down 9 Bill Tarrant attributes this to the different writing styles in English and Indonesian with English favouring the active voice and direct statements while respectful Indonesian favours the passive voice and a circuitous approach 21
