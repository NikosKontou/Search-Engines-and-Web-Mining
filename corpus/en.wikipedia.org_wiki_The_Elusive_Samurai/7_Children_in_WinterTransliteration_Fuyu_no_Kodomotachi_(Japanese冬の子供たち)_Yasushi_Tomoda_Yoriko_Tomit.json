With news that Sadamune's forces are attacking the borders of Suwa, the Elusive Warriors decide to investigate by themselves, despite Yorishige's protests. The group arrive at a village near the border where they are attacked by a teenage warrior fighting with two swords. Kojirō and Ayako fight the enemy until he recognizes Shizuku and introduces himself as Fubuki, a wandering warrior looking for a master to serve. Tokiyuki learns from Fubuki that Sadamune's forces attacked the village and killed all the adults, with Fubuki and the children having killed the invaders with traps and other diversions. Tokiyuki is advised to leave the village behind, taking the children with them, but he refuses, determined to protect the children's homes and invites Fubuki to join his group. Meanwhile, Sadamune's subordinate Shōkan, who leads a group of bandits and is behind the attacks, decides to attack the village by himself.",
