against the Saiyans In the afterlife Goku travels the million kilometer Snake Way so that he can train under the ruler of the North Galaxy King Kai King Kai teaches Goku the Kai o ken Kai ken lit Fist

will not make it until hours after the Saiyans arrive Goku's allies group up to fight until Goku gets back but prove to be no match for N appa and the Prince of All Saiyans Vegeta Yam cha Tien Shin han Chia o tzu and Piccolo all perish in the battle with Piccolo's death causing both Kami and the Dragon Balls to fade from existence When Goku finally arrives at the battlefield he avenges his fallen friends by easily defeating N appa before crippling him by breaking his spine in half A furious Vegeta then executes N appa for his failure to kill Goku Goku uses several grades of the Kai o

Great Ape which he uses to torture Goku Krillin and Gohan sense that Goku is in trouble and they return for a group fight with the now seemingly unstoppable Vegeta They are aided at key moments by Yaji robe who cuts Vegeta's tail to revert him into his normal state Goku gives Krillin a Spirit Bomb that he made and Krillin uses it to severely damage Vegeta Vegeta is ultimately defeated when he is crushed by Gohan's Great Ape form and he retreats to his spaceship as Krillin approaches to finish him off Goku convinces Krillin to spare Vegeta's life and allow him to escape Earth with Vegeta vowing to return and destroy the planet in revenge for his humiliation at Goku's hands During the battle Krillin overhears Vegeta mentioning the original set of Dragon Balls from Piccolo's homeworld Namek Namek ku sei While Goku recovers from his injuries Gohan Krillin and Goku's oldest friend Bulma depart for Namek to use these Dragon Balls to revive their fallen friends in the battle Upon their arrival on Namek Krillin Gohan and Bulma discover that Vegeta and his superior the galactic tyrant Frieza are already there each looking to use the Dragon Balls to obtain immortality Vegeta is stronger than before as Saiyans become stronger when they recover from the brink of death so he seizes the opportunity to rebel against Frieza A triangular game of cat and mouse ensues with Frieza Vegeta and Gohan plus Krillin alternately possessing one or more of the Dragon Balls with no one managing to possess all seven at any given time Vegeta manages to isolate Frieza's lieutenants one by one and kill them When Frieza sees that Vegeta is posing too big of a problem he summons the G in yu Force a team of elite mercenaries led by Captain G in yu who can switch bodies with his opponents Vegeta reluctantly teams up with Gohan and Krillin to fight them knowing that they are too much for him to handle alone The G in yu Force proves too powerful but Goku finally arrives and defeats them single handedly saving Vegeta Gohan and Krillin Vegeta believes Goku may have become the legendary warrior of the Saiyans the Super Saiyan S p Sai ya j in As Goku heals from a brutal fight with Captain G in yu Krillin Dende and Gohan secretly use the Dragon Balls behind Vegeta's back to wish for Piccolo's resurrection and teleport him to Namek Vegeta finds them using the Dragon Balls without him but the Grand Elder dies and rendering the Dragon Balls inert before he can wish for immortality Just as this happens Frieza arrives and decides to kill the four of them for denying him his wish for immortality Piccolo arrives on Namek but is accidentally separated from the others due to a badly worded wish He finds the strongest Namekian warrior Nail who was defeated by Frieza and fuses with him to greatly increase his power Despite both Piccolo and Vegeta's advances in power they are greatly outclassed by Frieza who goes through several transformations before reaching his final form which he then uses to kill Dende Goku arrives after healing from his injuries and Vegeta tells him that Frieza was the one who destroyed the Saiyan homeworld and massacred the Saiyan race as he feared that he would one day be overthrown by a Super Saiyan Frieza then kills Vegeta in front of Goku Though Goku's power exceeds Vegeta's he is still no match for Frieza Goku uses his last resort a massive Spirit Bomb with the energy of Namek and the surrounding worlds and it seemingly defeats the tyrant However Frieza manages to survive and he unleashes his wrath upon the group by gravely wounding Piccolo and murdering Krillin Goku's rage finally erupts and he undergoes a strange transformation that turns his hair blond his eyes green and causes a golden aura to radiate from his body Goku has finally become a Super Saiyan Meanwhile the revived Kami uses Earth's Dragon Balls to resurrect everyone on Namek that was killed by Frieza and his henchmen which also allows the Grand Elder to be resurrected for a short time and the Namekian Dragon to return Dende uses the final wish to teleport everyone on Namek to Earth except for Goku and Frieza Even at 100 power Frieza cannot manage to defeat the Super Saiyan transformation Goku outwits Frieza cutting him in half with his own attack before escaping Namek as the planet is destroyed in a massive explosion After the battle with Frieza Goku's friends and family are waiting for word on his return when a demonic star drifts into Earth's orbit and opens up a rift in space allowing the malevolent immortal Garlic Jr to break free from his imprisonment inside the Dead Zone Seeking revenge for a past defeat at the hands of Goku and Piccolo Garlic Jr traps Kami and Mr Popo inside a bottle and uses his Black Water Mist to turn all of Earth's inhabitants into bloodthirsty vampire like beings Gohan Krillin Piccolo Krillin's then girlfriend Maron and Gohan's pet dragon Icarus are the only ones unaffected and set out to stop Garlic Jr and restore the Earth and its inhabitants This proves to be easier said than done as Garlic Jr has complete immortality making him impossible to kill Luckily Gohan's hidden potential gives him the edge he needs to eradicate Garlic Jr 's forces and send him back into the Dead Zone He also destroys the star ensuring that Garlic Jr will remain trapped in the Dead Zone for all eternity One year later Frieza is revealed to have survived and arrives on Earth with his father King Cold seeking revenge However a mysterious young man named Trunks appears transforms into a Super Saiyan and kills Frieza and King Cold Goku returns a few hours later having spent the past year on the alien planet Yard rat learning a new technique Instant Transmission which allows him to teleport to any location he desires Trunks reveals privately to Goku that he is the son of Vegeta and Bulma and has traveled from 17 years in the future to warn Goku that two Androids J in z ning en lit Artificial Humans created by Dr Gero will appear in three years to seek revenge against Goku for destroying the Red Ribbon Army when he was a child Trunks says all of Goku's friends will fall to them while Goku himself will die from a heart virus six months before their arrival Trunks gives Goku medicine from the future that will save him from the heart virus and departs back to his own time When the androids arrive Goku falls ill during his fight with Android 19 but is saved by Vegeta who reveals that he has also achieved the Super Saiyan transformation Vegeta and Piccolo easily defeat Android 19 and Dr Gero who turned himself into Android 20 but Trunks returns from the future to check on their progress and reveals that the androids they defeated are not the ones that killed all of them in the future Goku is out of commission and his allies are overwhelmed by the arrival of Androids 16 17 and 18 while an even stronger bio Android called Cell emerges from a different timeline and embarks on a quest to find and absorb Androids 17 and 18 allowing him to attain his perfect form Cell successfully absorbs Android 17 becoming considerably more powerful but Vegeta returns to the battle having greatly elevated his power and easily overpowers him However Vegeta allows Cell to absorb Android 18 believing that his perfect form will be no match for his Super Saiyan power Vegeta is subsequently defeated with Cell mockingly thanking him for helping him achieve perfection Cell allows everyone to live for the time being and announces a fighting tournament to decide the fate of the Earth known as the Cell Games Goku recovered from the heart virus and having reached the zenith of the Super Saiyan form takes on Cell at the tournament Goku eventually realizes that Cell is far too powerful for him to handle and forfeits the fight to the astonishment of everyone else Goku proclaims that Gohan will be able to defeat Cell Though initially outclassed Gohan is eventually able to tap into his latent power and achieve the Super Saiyan 2 transformation after Android 16 sacrifices himself in a failed attempt to kill Cell Refusing to accept defeat Cell prepares to self destruct and destroy the Earth Goku uses his Instant Transmission ability to teleport himself and Cell to King Kai's planet where Cell explodes and kills everyone there However Cell survives the blast and returns to Earth more powerful than ever where he promptly murders Trunks but Gohan unleashes the totality of his power in a massive Kamehameha wave and obliterates Cell for good The Dragon Balls are then used to revive everyone that was killed by Cell while Goku chooses to remain in the afterlife refusing an offer by his friends to use the Namekian Dragon Balls to bring him back Trunks returns to his timeline and uses his bolstered power to finally slay the Future Androids and Cell Seven years later Goku is allowed to go back to Earth for one day to reunite with his loved ones and meet his youngest son Goten at the World Martial Arts Tournament Tenkaichi Bud kai Number One Martial Arts Gathering Under the Heavens Soon after Goku and his allies are drawn into a fight by the Supreme Kai against a magical being named Maj in Buu Maj in Buu summoned by the evil wizard Ba bidi All efforts to stop the resurrection prove to be futile as Buu is successfully revived and begins slaughtering Earth's inhabitants Goten and Trunks are taught the fusion technique by Piccolo while Gohan gets his latent potential unlocked by the Elder Supreme Kai Meanwhile Buu befriends Mr Satan and vows to never kill anyone ever again but is interrupted when a deranged gunman shoots and nearly kills Mr Satan As a result Maj in Buu becomes so angry that he expels the evil within himself creating an evil Buu that proceeds to absorb the good Buu The result is Super Buu a psychopathic monster who wants nothing more than the destruction of the universe After numerous battles that result in the deaths of many of Goku's allies as well as the destruction of Earth Goku is fully restored by the Elder Supreme Kai and defeats Kid Buu the original form of Maj in Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack containing the energy of all the inhabitants of Earth who were resurrected along with the planet by the Namekian Dragon Balls Goku makes a wish for Kid Buu to be reincarnated as a good person and ten years later at another Tenkaichi Bud kai he meets Kid Buu's human reincarnation Uub Leaving the match between them unfinished Goku departs with Uub so he can train him to become Earth's new defender Kazuhiko Torishima Akira Toriyama's editor for Dr Slump and the first half of Dragon Ball felt that the Dragon Ball anime's ratings were gradually declining because it had the same producer that worked on Dr Slump Torishima said this producer had this cute and funny image connected to Toriyama's work and was missing the more serious tone in the newer series and therefore asked the studio to change the producer Impressed with their work on Saint Seiya he asked its director K z Morishita and writer Takao Koyama to help reboot Dragon Ball which coincided with Goku growing up The new producer explained that ending the first anime and creating a new one would result in more promotional money The result was the start of Dragon Ball Z 8 Toriyama suggested the title because Z is the last letter of the alphabet He wanted to finish the series because he was running out of ideas for it 9 Ironically enough the sequel series would end up producing more episodes than its predecessor Dragon Ball Z is adapted from the final 324 chapters of the manga series which were published in Weekly Sh nen Jump from 1988 to 1995 It premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on April 26 1989 taking over its predecessor's time slot and ran for 291 episodes until its conclusion on January 31 1996 10 Because Toriyama was writing the manga during the production of the anime 11 Dragon Ball Z added original material not adapted from the manga including lengthening scenes or adding new ones and adding new attacks and characters not present in the manga For example Toriyama was asked to create an additional character for Goku's training with King Kai resulting in the cricket Gregory 12 Throughout the production the voice actors were tasked with playing different characters and performing their lines on cue switching between roles as necessary 13 The voice actors were unable to record the lines separately because of the close dialogue timing When asked if juggling the different voices of Goku Gohan and Goten were difficult Masa ko Nozawa said that it was not and that she was able to switch roles simply upon seeing the character's picture 13 She did admit that when they were producing two films a year and television specials in addition to the regular series there were times when they had only line art to look at while recording which made giving finer nuanced details in her performance difficult 14 One of the character designers for Dragon Ball Z was Tada yoshi Yama muro He was responsible for designing and animating Goku's Super Saiyan form in the series He used the martial artist Bruce Lee as a reference for Goku's Super Saiyan form stating that when he first becomes a Super Saiyan his slanting pose with that scowling look in his eyes is all Bruce Lee 15 In the original manga itself Goku's piercing eyes in Super Saiyan form were also based on Bruce Lee's paralyzing glare 16 In 1996 Funimation Productions now known as Crunchy roll LLC licensed Dragon Ball Z for an English language release in North America after cancelling their initial dub of Dragon Ball half way through their originally planned 26 episode first season 17 18 Funimation's 1996 release was not the first broadcast in the United States as some networks had already aired versions of the series in other languages on a smaller scale This included Nippon Golden Network's broadcast of a subtitled Japanese version in Hawaii from 1994 19 Funimation worked with Sab an Entertainment to syndicate the series on television and Pioneer Entertainment to handle home video distribution 20 A Vancouver based cast recording at the Ocean Studios were hired by Funimation to dub the anime Funimation had previously used a similar Vancouver based voice cast in their initial Dragon Ball dub recorded at Dick Roger's Sound Studio 21 22 Contract musicians for Sab an Ron Wasserman 23 and Jeremy Sweet 21 known for their work on the Power Rangers franchise composed a new guitar driven soundtrack The dub's opening theme nicknamed Rock the Dragon was sung by Sweet and afterwards Wasserman got hired by Sab an to do background music for the dub For contractual reasons the background music and opening theme was officially credited to Sab an founders Shu ki Levy and Haim Sab an under the alias K uss a Ma he hi with the actual extent of their involvement in the soundtrack being unclear 24 25 Funimation's initial English dub of Dragon Ball Z had mandated cuts to content and length which reduced the first 67 episodes into 53 though TV episode 53 actually ends half way through uncut episode 67 26 27 Most of the edits were done to make the anime more tame and kid friendly most notably having references to death sidestepped with phrases like sent to the next dimension 28 It premiered in the United States on September 13 1996 in first run syndication but halted production in 1998 after two seasons 26 despite strong ratings 29 This was due to Sab an scaling down its syndication operations in order to focus on producing original material for the Fox Kids Network and its newly acquired Fox Family Channel 30 31 Pioneer also ceased its home video release of the series at volume 17 the end of the dub and retained the rights to produce an uncut subtitled version 26 but did not do so They did however release uncut dubs of the first three Z movies on home video On August 31 1998 reruns of this canceled dub began airing on Cartoon Network as part of the channel's weekday afternoon To on ami block Cartoon Network eventually ordered more episodes of Dragon Ball Z and Funimation resumed production on the series ' English dub without Sab an's assistance Cartoon Network replaced the original Vancouver based cast with an in house voice cast at their Texas based studio with the goal of the new voices sounding similar to the Vancouver cast 32 The Sab an produced soundtrack from the first two seasons was replaced with a new background score composed by Bruce Fau lc one rand his team of musicians which was used throughout the rest of Funimation's Dragon Ball Z dub 23 This renewed dub featured less censorship due to both Sab an's absence and fewer restrictions on cable programming and aired new episodes

celebrations 42 The series premiered on Fuji TV in Japan on April 5 2009 under the title Dragon Ball Kai The ending suffix Kai in the name means updated or altered and reflects the improvements and corrections of the original work 43 The original footage was remastered for HDTV featuring updated opening and ending sequences new music and a re recording of the vocal tracks 43 44 The original material and any damaged frames were removed along with the majority of the filler episodes to more closely follow the manga resulting in a faster moving story 45 According to Torishima Kai was conceived when Bandai asked if a new Dragon Ball anime could be made to increase the franchise's merchandise sales As Toriyama refused to create a new story it was decided to release a remastered version of the Dragon Ball Z anime that more closely follows the manga instead He said the reception to Kai was positive so it all worked out 46 The series initially concluded on its 97 th episode in Japan on March 27 2011 with the finale of the Cell saga It was originally planned to run 98 episodes however due to the T hoku offshore earthquake and tsunami the final episode was not aired and was later released direct to video in Japan on August 2 2011 47 In November 2012 May umi Tanaka the Japanese voice actor of Krillin announced that she and the rest of the cast were recording more episodes

began airing in Japan on Fuji TV on April 6 2014 and ended its run on June 28 2015 49 The final arc of Kai was originally produced to last 69 episodes as most of the international versions run clarification needed 50 but the Japanese broadcast cut it down to 61 episodes Funimation licensed Kai for an English language release in February 2010 The series was initially broadcast in the U S on Nicktoons from May 24 2010 to January 1 2012 continuing in re runs until April 2013 51 52 In addition to Nicktoons the series also began airing on the 4 Kids owned Saturday morning programming block

content Kai began airing uncut on Adult Swim's To on ami block on November 8 2014 54 and re runs of the previous weeks ' episodes aired at the beginning of Adult Swim from February 2015 to June 2016 55 In the United Kingdom CSC Media Group acquired the broadcast rights to Kai and began airing it on K ix in early 2013 56 57 58 Despite Kai's continuation not being officially confirmed at the time

block The series aired from January 7 2017 to June 23 2018 alongside Dragon Ball Super 62 An alternate English dub of Kai by Ocean Productions was recorded for the original 98 episodes featuring many of the original Vancouver cast reprising their roles but it has yet to air when 63 64 65 66 Dragon Ball Z's original North American release was the subject of heavy editing which resulted in a large amount of removed content and alterations that greatly changed the original work Funimation CEO Gen Fuku naga is often criticized for his role in the editing but it was the initial distributor Sab an which required such changes or they would not air the work as was the case with the episode dealing with orphans 67 Note 2 These changes included altering every aspect of the show from character names clothing scenes and dialogue of the show The character Mr Satan was renamed Hercule and this change has been retained in other English media such as Viz's Dragon Ball Z manga and video games though the English dubs of Dragon Ball Kai and Dragon Ball Super changed the name back to Mr Satan 68 The dialogue changes would sometimes contradict the scenes itself after the apparent fatal explosion of a helicopter one of the characters said I can see their parachutes they're okay 67 Funimation's red ub for the 2005 release would address many of the issues raised by Sab an with the uncut releases preserving the integrity of the original Japanese release During the original Japanese TV airing of Dragon Ball Kai scenes involving blood and brief nudity were removed Nicktoons would also alter Kai for its broadcast it released a preview showcasing these changes which included removing the blood and cheek scar from Bardock and altering the color of Master Rosh i's alcohol 69 The show was further edited for its broadcast on The CW most notoriously the character Mr Popo was tinted blue The s how's DVD and Blu ray releases only contained the edits present in the original Japanese version A rumor that Cartoon Network would be airing Kai uncut was met with an official statement to debunk the rumor in June 2010 70 However it would later air uncut on the channel as part of Adult Swim's To on ami block Steven Simmons who did the subtitling for Funimation's home video releases offered commentary on the subtitling from a project and technical standpoint addressing several concerns 71 Note 3 Simmons said that Gen Fuku naga did not want any swearing on the discs but because there was no taboo word list Simmons would substitute a variation in the strength of the words by situation with the changes starting in episode 21 72 The typographical errors in the script were caused by dashes and double quotes failing to appear which resulted in confusing dialogue 72 Dragon Ball Z has released a series of 21 soundtracks as part of the Dragon Ball Z Hit Song Collection series In total dozens of releases exist for Dragon Ball Z which includes Japanese and foreign adapted releases of the anime themes and video game soundtracks Shunsuke Kikuchi composed the score for Dragon Ball Z The opening theme for the first 199 episodes is Cha La Head Cha La performed by Hironobu Kageyama The second

Incredible Full Power performed by MANNA The second ending theme used for the remaining episodes is Boku tachi wa Ten shi Datta We Were Angels performed by Kageyama The initial English Language

Dragon Ball Kai The opening theme Dragon Soul and the first ending theme used for the first 54 episodes Yeah Break Care Break are both performed by Takayoshi Tani moto of the unit Dragon Soul in Japanese Sean S chem mel Just in Cook Vic Mig no gn a Greg Ayr es Sonny Strait and Brin a Pale nci a performed the English version of the opening theme while Jerry Jewell performed the English version of the ending theme 74 The second ending theme used from episodes 55 98 is Kok oro no Han e Wings of the Heart performed by Team Dragon a unit of the idol girl group AKB 48 in Japanese and Leah Clark in English 75 On March 9 2011 Toei announced that due to Yamamoto's score infringing on the rights of an unknown third party or parties the music for remaining episodes and reruns of previous episodes would be replaced 76 Later reports from Toei stated that except for the series ' opening and closing songs as well as eye catch music Yamamoto's score was replaced with Shunsuke Kikuchi's score from Dragon Ball Z The music for The Final Chapters is composed by Nori hito Sumitomo 77 The opening theme is Ku u Zen Ze tsu Go by Takayoshi Tani moto of Dragon Soul while the first ending song is Hai kei

2011 84 The international home release structure of Dragon Ball Z is complicated by the licensing and release of the companies involved in producing and distributing the work Releases of the media occurred on both VHS and DVD with separate edited and uncut versions being released simultaneously Both versions of the edited and uncut material are treated as different entries and would frequently make Billboard rankings as separate entries Home release sales were featured prominently on the Nielsen VideoS can charts 34 Further complicating the release of the material was Funimation itself which was known to release DVDs out of sequence in order to get them out as fast as possible as in the case of their third season 85 Pioneer Entertainment distributed the Funimation Sab an edited only dub of 53 episodes on seventeen VHS between 1997 and 1999 86 87 and seventeen DVDs throughout 1999 88 89 Two box sets separating them into the Saiyan and Namek arcs were also released on VHS in 1999

the retail price they were able to sell them for 105 Only a year later the company began producing a cropped 16 9 remastered Blu ray release in 2013 with nine sets released in total 106 In March 2019 Funimation announced plans to release a 30 th anniversary Blu ray release of Dragon Ball Z with the box set being remastered in 4 3 aspect ratio and containing an art book and a collectible figure 107 108 It would be crowd funded originally requiring a minimum of 2500 pre orders in order to be manufactured but was later increased to a minimum of 3 000 units 109 The release sparked controversy amongst fans due to the framing of the video color saturation and digital video noise reduction 110 111 Funimation responded by stating that they cropped the release by going in scene by scene to make judgements based on the image available in each frame of how much to trim to get to a consistent 4 3 aspect ratio while still attempting to cut as little out of the picture as possible and that they felt the digital video noise reduction was mandatory for this release based on the different levels of fan support from various past DBZ releases with different levels of noise reduction over the years 112 In Japan Dragon Ball Kai was released on wide screen on 33 DVDs and full screen on a single Blu ray and eight four disc Blu ray sets from September 18 2009 to August 2 2011 Funimation released eight DVD and Blu ray box sets of Dragon Ball Z Kai from May 18 2010 to June 5 2012 113 114 These sets contain the original Japanese audio track with English subtitles as well as the uncut version of the English dub which does not contain any of the edits made for the TV airings Before the final volume was even published Funimation began re releasing the series in four DVD and Blu ray season sets between May 22 2012 and March 12 2013 115 116 Funimation released The Final Chapters in three DVD and Blu ray volumes from April 25 to June 20 2017 117 118 119 While the manga was all titled Dragon Ball in Japan due to the popularity of the Dragon Ball Z anime in the west Viz Media initially changed the title of the last 26 volumes of the manga to Dragon Ball Z to avoid confusion The volumes were originally published in Japan between 1988 and 1995 It began serialization in the American Shonen Jump beginning in the middle of the series with the appearance of Trunks the tank bon volumes of both Dragon Ball Zand Dragon Ball were released simultaneously by Viz Media in the United States 120 121 In March 2001 Viz continued this separation by re shipping the Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z titles starting with the first volumes of each work 122 Viz's marketing for the manga made distinct the differences between Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z tone Viz billed Dragon Ball Z More action packed than the stories of Goku's youth Dragon Ball Z is pure adrenaline with battles of truly Earth shaking proportions 123 Between 2008 and 2010 Viz re released the two series in a format called Viz Big Edition which collects three individual volumes into a single large volume 124 Viz Media republished the series in fourteen 3 in 1 volumes including what they previously released as Dragon Ball Z under the Dragon Ball name between June 4 2013 and September 6 2016 125 126 The Dragon Ball Z films comprise a total of 15 entries as of 2015 The first 13 films were typically released every March and July during the series ' original run by the spring and summer vacations of Japanese schools They were typically double features paired up with other anime films and were thus usually an hour or less in length These films themselves offer contradictions in both chronology and design that make them incompatible with a single continuity All 15 films were licensed in North America by Funimation and all have received in house dubs by the company Before Funimation the third film was a part of the short lived Sab an syndication being split into three episodes and the first three films received uncut English dubs in 1998 produced by Funimation with Ocean Studios and released by Pioneer Several of the films have been broadcast on Cartoon Network and Nicktoons in the United States To on ami UK in the United Kingdom these featured an alternate English dub produced by an unknown cast by AB Groupe and Cartoon Network in Australia Three TV specials based on Dragon Ball Z were produced and broadcast on Fuji TV The first two were Dragon Ball Z Bardock The Father of Goku in 1990 and Dragon Ball Z The History of Trunks in 1993 the latter being based on a special chapter of the original manga Both were licensed by Funimation in North America and AB Groupe in Europe In 2013 a two part hour long crossover with One Piece and To riko titled Dream 9 To riko One Piece Dragon Ball Z Ch Collaboration Special was created and aired Additionally two original video animations OVAs bearing the Dragon Ball Z title have been made The first is Dragon Ball Z Side Story Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans which was originally released in 1993 in two parts as Official Visual Guides for the video game of the same title Dragon Ball Plan to Eradicate the Super Saiyans was a 2010 remake of this OVA None of the OVAs have been dubbed into English and the only one to see a release in North America is the 2010 remake which was subtitled and included as a bonus feature in Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2 Over 57 video games are bearing the Dragon Ball Z name across a range of platforms from the Nintendo Entertainment System to the current generation consoles with the most recent release being Dragon Ball Z Kakar ot in 2020 In North America licensing rights had been given to both Namco Bandai and Atari In 1999 Atari acquired exclusive rights to the video games through

Carrie Lynn D Reinhard note that Western fans flocked to Dragon Ball Z because it offered exciting action not found in movies or television shows animated or otherwise at that time 137 A key characteristic that set Dragon Ball Z and later other anime shows apart from American television shows at the time was a serialization format in which a continuous story arc stretches over multiple episodes or seasons Traditional American television had an episodic format with each episode typically consisting of a self contained story Serialization has since also become a common characteristic of American streaming television shows during the Peak TV era 138 Funimation's in house English dub though has received mixed reviews from some critics over the years IGN criticized the dub for having poor quality along with some over the top and quite annoying voice acting Frieza's female voice in particular left many fans confused over the character's gender 139 Other criticisms have been towards the English dub's script and inaccurately translating the source material such as portraying Goku's character as a more stoic superhero 140 141 Dragon Ball Z's popularity is reflected through a
