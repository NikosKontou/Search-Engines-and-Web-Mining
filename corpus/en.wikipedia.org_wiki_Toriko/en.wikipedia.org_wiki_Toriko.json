called To riko an absolute feast for fans of beasts not able to tell whether Shimabukuro just comes up with everything on the spot or if it's all meticulously planned out and said that the series ' charm is how it effortlessly applies classic shonen tropes to such an outlandish world 63 However he commented that The formula of To riko is apparent right from the start in true shonen fashion tougher and tougher creatures will quickly follow 64 Deb Aoki writing for About com also praised the imaginative beasts and monsters of the series as well as the occasional informational bits on the true science of foods but called the art grotesquely goofy 2 Lissa Pat till o of Anime News Network ANN called To riko an in your face action story riding on the back of a gastronomic fetch quest 65 She compared To riko's design to that of characters from Dragon Ball and Fist of the North Star and suggested this might deter some readers 65 ANN's Rebecca Silverman stated that Shimabukuro has clearly devoted time and thought to crafting the story's world as complex creatures animal profiles and distinctive landscapes attest and called his art an odd mix of old school JoJo's Bizarre Adventure style manly men and newer One Piece style chibi s 66 Carlo Santos also for ANN praised the action saying For over the top action it's hard to beat the thrill of To riko punching out a swarm of giant insects or the creep factor of a villain who literally wears another human's skin and called the art one of the series ' highlights 67 Reviewing the anime Santos said Fans will know what to expect in each adventure ravenous strong men flexing their superpowers ferocious foes being slaughtered by said strong men and a rich imaginative world full of impossibly delicious foods But the simplicity of To riko is also its downfall there are no clever twists in store the characters don't develop at all either personally or inter personally and even the most calculating villains are just mindless targets waiting to be knocked down one by one The on again off again animation also does a disservice to the bright colors and creative designs of the series 68",
