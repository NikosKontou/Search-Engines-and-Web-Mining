    "transformers_text": "Toriko ( トリコ ) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro . It was serialized in Shueisha 's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from May 2008 to November 2016, with its chapters collected into 43 tankōbon volumes. The series follows the adventures of Toriko, a Gourmet Hunter, as he searches for rare, diverse foods to complete a full-course meal. On his journey, he is accompanied by a timid chef who wants to improve his skills.\n\nA short film was created by Ufotable for the Jump Super Anime Tour 2009, with another created for the 2010 tour. The manga has also been adapted into an anime television series produced by Toei Animation , which was broadcast in Japan from April 2011 to March 2014. Additionally, Toei developed a 2011 animated 3D short film and a 2013 feature film.\n\nThe manga series has been licensed for English release by Viz Media in North America and Madman Entertainment in Australasia. Madman also licensed the anime series in Australasia, while Funimation licensed it in North America. Discotek Media licensed the 2013 film in North America.\n\nBy August 2023, the Toriko manga had over 30 million copies in circulation.\n\nThe alternate depiction of Earth in Toriko is separated into two parts; the Human World ( 人間界 , Ningen-kai ) and the Gourmet World ( グルメ界 , Gurume-kai ) . [ 4 ] The Human World is where modern civilization exists and occupies just 30% of the planet, the rest is the Gourmet World, which is inhospitable to most humans due to the strength of the wildlife and extreme climate changes. In the Gourmet Age ( グルメ時代 , Gurume Jidai ) , which began five centuries ago at the end of the hundred-year war, the taste and texture of food is extremely important. The International Gourmet Organization ( 国際グルメ機構 , Kokusai Gurume Kikō ) (IGO), maintains order and defends civilians from dangerous animals and gourmet criminals. Originally set up by the United Nations , the IGO is now independent from them and holds more influence as it is composed of 360 nations. [ 5 ] They apply a numerical rating from 1 to 100, referred to as Capture Levels ( 捕獲レベル , Hokaku Reberu ) , to most ingredients based on the difficulty of acquiring it. [ 6 ] The IGO has a group of seven individuals with highly sensitive taste, called the Gourmet 7 ( グルメセブン , Gurume Sebun ) or G7, that are in charge of assigning the star ranking of restaurants and the ranking of chefs. [ 7 ]\n\nIndividuals known as Gourmet Hunters ( 美食屋 , Bishokuya ; lit. \"Gourmet Food Providers\") , who have usually trained their abilities to that of superhuman, are regularly hired by restaurants and the rich to seek high-level ingredients and rare animals. One can also increase their strength by implanting Gourmet Cells ( グルメ細胞 , Gurume Saibō ) into their bodies. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Gourmet Revivers ( 再生屋 , Saiseiya ; lit. \"Regeneration Providers\") are those who dedicate themselves to protecting ingredients from extinction or exhaustion, and who can also arrest people that partake in the transaction of illegal goods, violate poaching laws, [ 10 ] [ 11 ] or causes extinction of an entire species.\n\nToriko is a Gourmet Hunter searching for the most precious foods in the world so he can create his full-course meal. A man with inhuman ability, he utilizes his incredible strength and knowledge of the animal kingdom to capture ferocious, evasive, and rare beasts to further his menu. He is accompanied by the weak and timid chef Komatsu, who, inspired by Toriko's ambition, travels with him to improve his culinary skills and to find rare ingredients. Toriko and his friends often fight against the Gourmet Corps ( 美食會 , Bishoku-kai ) , who seek to take control of the world's entire food supply and are looking for the highly sought-after ingredient GOD ( GOD（ゴッド） , Goddo ) , which the legendary Gourmet Hunter Acacia used to end the war that took place five-hundred years before the series began.\n\nWritten and illustrated by Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro , Toriko was serialized in the manga anthology Weekly Shōnen Jump from May 19, 2008, [ 12 ] to November 21, 2016. [ 3 ] The 396 individual chapters were collected and published into 43 tankōbon volumes by Shueisha between November 4, 2008, [ 13 ] and December 31, 2016. [ 14 ] Readers and fans of the series were able to submit ideas and designs for monsters and ingredients that appear in the manga. [ 15 ]\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con in 2009, Viz Media announced they had licensed Toriko for English release. [ 16 ] They released the 43 volumes from June 1, 2010, [ 17 ] to August 7, 2018. [ 18 ] The manga premiered in the February 2010 edition of a digital supplement available only to subscribers of Viz's printed Shonen Jump magazine. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] When the printed magazine ended, Toriko was one of the launch titles of its digital successor Weekly Shonen Jump (originally named Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha ), starting with chapter 171 in its debut issue on January 30, 2012. [ 21 ] The Toriko and One Piece crossover was sent out free to annual subscribers of the magazine who signed up before April 30, 2012. Madman Entertainment released the first volume in Australasia on July 10, 2010, [ 22 ] and have released twenty-six volumes as of April 10, 2015.

Akuma no Mi!! ; lit. \"The True Food! Devil Fruit!!\") , [ 24 ] which ran in the April 4, 2011 issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump .

It premiered on Hulu and Funimation's official website on April 14. [ 40 ] Eventually, the series was rescheduled to stream within three days after the Japanese broadcast. [ 41 ] Funimation began releasing the series on DVD with an English dub from January 8, 2013, which abruptly stopped on May 7, 2013, for unknown reasons. [ 42 ] Madman Entertainment announced they licensed the anime for Australasia on February 3, 2013. [ 43 ]\n\nA book titled Toriko Gaiden ( トリコ外伝 ) was published on October 2, 2009, consisting of an interview with Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro, the 2007 Toriko one-shot, and other unrelated one-shots by the author.

[ 46 ]\n\nThe television show Sakiyomi Jum-Bang! created a Vomic, a portmanteau of voice and comic, of the first couple chapters of Toriko in 2009.

[ 62 ]\n\nOtaku USA ' s Joseph Luster called Toriko \"an absolute feast for fans of beasts\", not able to tell \"whether Shimabukuro just comes up with everything on the spot or if it's all meticulously planned out\", and said that the series' charm is \"how it effortlessly applies classic shonen tropes to such an outlandish world.\" [ 63 ] However, he commented that \"The formula of Toriko is apparent right from the start in true shonen fashion[...] tougher and tougher creatures will quickly follow.\" [ 64 ] Deb Aoki writing for About.com also praised the imaginative beasts and monsters of the series, as well as the occasional informational bits on the true science of foods, but called the art \"grotesquely goofy.\" [ 2 ]\n\nLissa Pattillo of Anime News Network (ANN) called Toriko an \"in-your-face action story riding on the back of a gastronomic fetch-quest.\" [ 65 ] She compared Toriko's design to that of characters from Dragon Ball and Fist of the North Star , and suggested this might deter some readers. [ 65 ] ANN's Rebecca Silverman stated that \"Shimabukuro has clearly devoted time and thought to crafting the story's world, as complex creatures, animal profiles, and distinctive landscapes attest.\", and called his art an \"odd mix of old school JoJo's Bizarre Adventure -style manly men and newer One Piece -style chibis .\" [ 66 ] Carlo Santos, also for ANN, praised the action, saying \"For over-the-top action, it's hard to beat the thrill of Toriko punching out a swarm of giant insects, or the creep factor of a villain who literally wears another human's skin.\", and called the art one of the series' highlights. [ 67 ] Reviewing the anime, Santos said \"Fans will know what to expect in each adventure: ravenous strongmen flexing their superpowers, ferocious foes being slaughtered by said strongmen, and a rich, imaginative world full of impossibly delicious foods. But the simplicity of Toriko is also its downfall: there are no clever twists in store, the characters don't develop at all, either personally or interpersonally, and even the most calculating villains are just mindless targets waiting to be knocked down one by one. The on-again, off-again animation also does a disservice to the bright colors and creative designs of the series.\" [ 68 ]",
