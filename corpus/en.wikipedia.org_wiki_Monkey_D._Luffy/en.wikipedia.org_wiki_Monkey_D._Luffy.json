    "transformers_text": "Monkey D Luffy lu fi LOO fee Japanese D Hepburn Monk D Ru fi i also known as Straw Hat Luffy n 2 is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Japanese manga series One Piece created by Eiichiro Oda as well as the central character of the franchise generated from it Luffy made his debut as a young boy who acquires the properties of rubber after accidentally eating one of the Devil Fruits Monkey D Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and dreamt of being a pirate since childhood from the influence of his idol and mentor Red Haired Shanks At the age of 17 Luffy sets sail from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure One Piece to succeed Gol D Roger as King of the Pirates He fights multiple antagonists and aids and befriends the inhabitants of several islands on his journey Usually cheerful he becomes serious and even aggressive when he fights Luffy uses his rubber body to concentrate his power executing a range of attacks In his signature attack the Gum Gum Pistol he slingshots punches at opponents from a distance Luffy also grows stronger over the course of the story by transforming his body through different Gears this is reflected in his bounty which is used to measure the threat he poses to the World Government which forbids piracy Luffy clashes with the three kinds of great powers in One Piece the World Government's Marines and its allied privateers known as the Seven Warlords of the Sea and the most influential pirate captains known as the Four Emperors Luffy is the grandson of vice admiral Monkey D Gar p of the Marines the son of Revolutionary Army leader Monkey D Dragon and sworn brother to Port gas D Ace and S abo During the course of Luffy's journey he makes many friends and recruits to his crew the swordsman Roro no a Zoro navigator Nami sniper Us opp chef Sanji doctor Tony Tony Chopper archaeologist Nico Robin shipwright Franky musician Brook and helmsman Jim bei who was once one of the Seven Warlords Luffy's rise alters the balance of power between great powers on the Blue Planet After two years Luffy gains a grand fleet of over 5 600 pirates becomes an Emperor of the Sea then puts Fish Man Island and the Wa no Country under his protection Luffy is currently one of the three most powerful pirate captains alongside his mentor Shanks and his rival Blackbeard Luffy appears in most episodes films television specials and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations as well as in several of the franchise's video games Due to the series ' international popularity Luffy is one of the world's most recognizable manga and anime characters Beyond the One Piece franchise the character also appears in various manga anime series and collaborative video games His critical reception has been largely positive with him placing first in every popularity poll When Eiichiro Oda created Luffy he initially strove for a manliness similar to that of Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball series 9 Oda said that he named his main character Luffy because he felt that the name suited him When he later learned about the sailing term lu ff ing he was delighted by the coincidence 10 In his prototype one shot Romance Dawn Oda refined the artistic style and story elements before publishing the final product a year later as the first chapter of One Piece In the second version of Romance Dawn Luffy resembled his design at the beginning of the series 11 After the one shot of One Piece was made Oda contacted his former mentor Nobuhiro Wat suki whom he assisted in making the manga Rur o uni Kenshin Wat suki was pleased with Luffy's characterization and advised Oda to briefly change him for the main series to make it look like Luffy is always acting on his own free will 12 To please his readers Oda added rubber iz ation to Luffy for comic effect 10 and tries to make the character straightforward 13 In retrospect Wat suki felt characters like Luffy reflect a trend of heroes who do not kill their enemies similar to his character Him ura Kenshin 14 In the original Japanese version of the One Piece anime series and later spin offs of the franchise Luffy is voiced by May umi Tanaka 15 Tanaka said jokingly that she regrets providing Luffy's voice because she is a mother in real life and Luffy is much younger 16 Asked about her voicing Tanaka said that she strives for reality in scenes where Luffy speaks when he is eating or touching his nose 17 In the OVA Defeat the Pirate Gan zack Luffy was voiced by Ur ara Taka no 18 In Ode x's English dubbed VCDs produced by Voiceover s Unlimited Luffy is voiced by Chuck Powers the director of said English version In this edition his name is mispronounced as Lu h fee l fi 19 The character was voiced by Erica Schroeder in 4 Kids Entertainment's English language dubs of the franchise between 2004 2006 Following Funimation Crunchy roll's acquisition of the franchise license in 2007 Colleen Clink en beard became the voice of Luffy in all English language releases 20 In the live action adaptation of One Piece Luffy is portrayed by Mexican actor I aki Godoy 21 while Colt on Osorio plays Luffy as a kid 22 Godoy and Tanaka reprised their roles as Luffy in the Latin American Spanish and Japanese dubs of the adaptation respectively 23 24 Luffy is usually recognizable by his straw hat a gift from Red Haired Shanks In his early childhood he wears a white shirt and blue shorts The character has a scar under his left eye from stabbing himself to demonstrate his courage to Shanks and his crew 25 He later wears a red vest denim shorts and sandals before replacing his vest with a red unbuttoned sea captain's coat 26 revealing the X shaped scar on his chest he received from Aka in u 27 and a yellow sash tied around his waist 26 In an interview Eiichiro Oda said Luffy's real world nationality analogue is Brazilian 28 Luffy is portrayed as a carefree fun loving happy go lucky character with great ambition and a huge appetite often thinking with his stomach and comically gorging himself Optimistic 29 and generally good hearted he is not as dimwitted as many believe him to be and he often demonstrates more understanding than the other characters expect Knowing the danger ahead Luffy is willing to risk his life to become King of the Pirates and protect his crew A capable and reliable captain he never puts his crew or himself at risk out of incompetence During the Logue town story arc Smoker a navy captain at the time says that Luffy enjoys playing stupid Luffy responds with a mysterious smile He enlists Chopper and Brook for his crew not just for their personality or appearance but also because of his instinctive ability to read people Luffy needs key jobs filled by his crew cook navigator medic musician and shipwright filled by Sanji Nami Chopper Brook and Franky respectively At the beginning of the series he said that he wanted at least ten crew members with abilities he felt necessary for his goal Despite his carefree personality each crew member respects him in their own way 30 31 Luffy is rarely concerned about the consequences of his actions doing what he feels is right at the moment even if it leads to retaliation by a powerful force 32 He is an extremely loyal captain who has demonstrated throughout the series that he is willing to risk his life for the well being of his crew 33 Luffy's rubber attributes are a result of him eating a devil fruit called the Human Human fruit model Sun God Nik a This devil fruit is thought to be called the Gum Gum fruit due to the world government's propaganda 34 35 Granting him a rubber like body his powers make him immune to electric attacks and most blunt forces but he is susceptible to attacks made with a sharp object or weapon eg sword spear His rubber devil fruit powers grant him the ability to stretch his body at will He uses his elasticity to accelerate part or all of his body to deliver punches kicks head butts and many other varied attacks as seen throughout the series Like others who have eaten a Devil Fruit Luffy cannot swim when he is submerged in water or contacts the Sea Prism Stone he loses his strength and cannot move on his own In addition to his Devil Fruit powers he has immense strength durability speed reflexes agility endurance and stamina Luffy's signature attack is the Gum Gum Pistol Go mu Go mu no P is u toru a punch which he learned during years of training Another technique developed later in the series is Gear 2 2 Gia Sek ando which increases his strength and speed for a short time but strains his body and can shorten his lifespan if used too long Observing CP 9's S have S or u technique Luffy adapts the move to his rubber body and can make his arms or legs bigger Gear 3 3 Gia S do another technique uses air in his bones to attack but makes him shrink afterward 36 Luffy can use both techniques simultaneously after the two year time skip he gains better control of these techniques and is no longer affected by their drawbacks Luffy develops another technique Gear 4 4 Gia F su similar to Gear 3 inflating his muscles with air to increase the size of his body except for his legs while his limbs are coated in Armament Hak i In contrast to Gears 2 and 3 Luffy uses compression rather than extension for his attacks compressing and releasing his limbs to dish out devastating blows The force of his kicks are to an extent that he uses them to fly in a similar fashion to CP 9's Moon Walk G epp technique 37 Later it is revealed that the Gum Gum Fruit's real name is the Human Human Fruit Model Nik a a Mythical Zo an type Devil Fruit whose awakening grants Luffy's rubber like body increased strength and freedom including turning the environment and other living beings into rubber which is limited only by the user's imagination It is for this reason that the user is said to become a trickster sun god known as the embodiment of freedom able to bring joy to the people around them and making it the most ridiculous power in the world 1 In Gear 5 5 Gia F if usu Luffy's hair and clothes also turn white The World Government renamed it to erase the fruit's original name from history and reclassified it as a Paramecia in order to conceal its true nature 1 The fruit was originally a treasure sought by the World Government for over 800 years until it was stolen by Red haired Shanks 38 39 According to the Five Elders the fruit had not been awakened for centuries prior to Luffy's having done so 1 Luffy has the ability to use Hak i ambition This ability has three types Armament Hak i Bus shoku no Hak i an armor like force which can amplify defense and the force of attacks and negate a Devil Fruit user's defense allow physical contact and damage Observation Hak i Ken buns hoku no Hak i a sixth sense which can read a person's moves and detect their presence and Conqueror's Hak i Ha shoku no Hak i which can render weak willed people or animals near him unconscious 40 Luffy learns all those types of Hak i and uses them with his improved attacks As a result of his encounter with Magellan he has also developed an immunity to poison although it is shown that a strong poison may affect him albeit very slowly During his fight against Charlotte Kata kuri Luffy gains an advanced form of Observation Hak i Called Future Sight to see several seconds into the future 41 During his time at Udon prison in Wa no Luffy gains two new advanced forms of Armament Hak i The first one is called Emission to shoot a short blast of Hak i from a distance while the second one is called Internal Destruction which can also go inside his target's body or objects and destroy it from within 42 During his fight with Kai dou at the top of On iga shima Luffy unlocks an advanced form of Conqueror's Hak i It is the ability to coat his entire body with it similar to Armament Hak i which could further enhance his attacks 43 Throughout One Piece the bounty placed on Luffy continually increases as he faces off against increasingly powerful pirates representing his notoriety in the One Piece world After defeating Buggy Don Krieg andAr long of East Blue early on in the series Luffy's initial bounty is set to 30 000 000 Berries By the major time skip in One Piece this number had increased to 400 000 000 Berries after defeating some of the Seven
