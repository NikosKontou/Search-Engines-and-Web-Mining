    "transformers_text": "One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda which has been translated into various languages and spawned a substantial media franchise , including animated and live action television series, films , video games , and associated music and merchandise. It follows the adventures of the teenaged boy and pirate captain Monkey D. Luffy , whose body gained the properties of rubber after he accidentally ate a supernatural fruit, as he travels the oceans in search of the series' titular treasure and organizes a diverse crew, named the Straw Hats .\n\nIn Japan, the series is published by Shueisha . Individual chapters have been published regularly in the shōnen manga anthology Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 22, 1997 and tankōbon format volumes (each collecting 10 to 12 chapters) have been published since December 24, 1997. [ 1 ] The series spans over 1128 chapters and, as of November 2024 [update] , has 111 tankōbon volumes, making One Piece the 19th longest manga series by volume count .\n\nThe series has been translated and released in multiple countries. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] English localization began in North America, where Viz Media currently serializes One Piece in the Shonen Jump digital vault simultaneously with Japan.
