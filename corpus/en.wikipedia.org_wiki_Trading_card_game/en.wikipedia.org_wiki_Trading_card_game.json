    "transformers_text": "A collectible card game CCG also called a trading card game TCG among other names note 1 is a type of card game that mixes strategic deck building elements with features of trading cards 2 3 The genre was introduced with Magic The Gathering in 1993 Cards in CCG s are specially designed sets of playing cards Each card represents an element of the theme and rules of the game and each can fall in categories such as creatures enhancements events resources and locations 4 All cards within the CCG typically share the same common backside art while the front has a combination of proprietary artwork or images to embellish the card along with instructions for the game and flavor text 5 CCG s are typically themed around fantasy or science fiction genres and have also included horror themes cartoons and sports and may include licensed intellectual properties 4 Generally a player will begin playing a CCG with a pre made starter deck then later customize their deck with cards they acquire from semi random booster packs or trade with other players 6 As a player obtains more cards they may create new decks from scratch using the cards in their collection Players choose what cards to add to their decks based on a particular strategy while also staying within the limits of the rule set Games are commonly played between two players though multiplayer formats are also common Gameplay in CCG is typically turn based with each player starting with a shuffled deck then drawing and playing cards in turn to achieve a win condition before their opponent often by scoring points or reducing their opponent's hit points 4 Dice counters card sleeves or play mats may be used to complement gameplay 4 Players compete for prizes at tournaments 5 Expansion sets are used to extend CCG s introducing new gameplay strategies and narrative lore through new cards in starter decks and booster packs 5 that may also lead to the development of theme decks Successful CCG s typically have thousands of unique cards through multiple expansions Magic The Gathering initially launched with 300 unique cards 7 and currently has more than 22 000 as of March 2020 update 8 The first CCG Magic The Gathering was developed by Richard Garfield and published by Wizards of the Coast in 1993 and its initial runs rapidly sold out that year 4 By the end of 1994 Magic The Gathering had sold over 1 billion cards 9 and during its most popular period between 2008 and 2016 it sold over 20 billion cards 10 Magic The Gathering's early success led other game publishers to follow suit with their own CCG s in the following years 4 Other successful CCG s include Yu Gi Oh 11 which is estimated to have sold about 35 billion cards as of January 2021 update 12 and Pok mon which has sold over 75 billion cards as of March 2025 update 13 Other notable CCG s have come and gone including Legend of the Five Rings Star Wars Lord of the Rings Vampire The Eternal Struggle and World of Warcraft Many other CCG s were produced but had little or no commercial success 14 Recently digital collectible card games DC CGs have gained popularity spurred by the success of online versions of CCG s like Magic The Gathering Online and wholly digital CCG s like Hearth stone 15 CCG s have further influenced other card game genres including deck building games like Dominion and Living card games developed by Fantasy Flight Games A collectible card game CCG is generally defined as a game where players acquire cards into a personal collection from which they create customized decks of cards and challenge other players in matches Players usually start by purchasing a starter deck that is ready to play but additional cards are obtained from randomized booster packs or by trading with other players 16 The goal of most CCG s is to beat one's opponent by crafting customized decks that play to syne r gies of card combinations Refined decks will try to account for randomness created by the initial shuffling of the deck as well as the opponent's actions by using complementary and preferably efficient cards The exact definition of what makes a CCG is varied as many games are marketed under the collectible card game moniker The basic definition requires the game to resemble trading cards in shape and function be mass produced for trading and or collect i bil it y and have rules for strategic gameplay 17 18 The definition of CCG s is further refined as being a card game in which the player uses their own deck with cards primarily sold in random assortments If every card in the game can be obtained by making a small number of purchases or if the manufacturer does not market it as a CCG then it is not a CCG 19 CCG s can further be designated as living or dead games Dead games are those CCG s that are no longer supported by their manufacturers and have ceased releasing expansions Living games are those CCG s that continue to be published by their manufacturers Usually this means that new expansions are being created for the game and official game tournaments are occurring in some fashion 19 20 17 18 Each game has a fundamental set of rules that describes the players ' objectives the categories of cards used in the game and the basic rules by which the cards interact Each card will have additional text explaining that specific card's effect on the game Many games utilize a set of keywords to simplify the card text with keywords referring to common gameplay rules For example Magic The Gathering has about 25 common keywords such as flying meaning the creature can only be blocked by other creatures with flying Each card also generally represents some specific element derived from the game's genre setting or source material The cards are illustrated and named for these source elements and the card's game function may relate to the subject For example Magic The Gathering is based on the fantasy genre so many of the cards represent creatures and magical spells from that setting In the game a dragon is illustrated as a reptilian beast has higher stats than smaller creatures and has the aforementioned flying keyword Flavor text on cards is frequently used to provide a narrative for story driven games or sometimes as humorous a sides The bulk of games are designed around a resource system by which the pace of each game is controlled Frequently the cards which constitute a player's deck are considered a resource and the frequency of cards moving from the deck to the play area or the player's hand is tightly controlled Relative card strength is often balanced by the number or type of resources needed in order to play the card and pacing after that may be determined by the flow of cards moving in and out of play Resources may be specific cards themselves or represented by other means for example tokens in various resource pools symbols on cards etc Unlike traditional card games such as poker or crazy eights in which a deck's content is limited and pre determined players select which cards will compose their deck from any available cards printed for the game This allows a player to strategically customize their deck to take advantage of favorable card interactions combinations and statistics Deck sizes vary from CCG to CCG needing to be large enough for variation in gameplay while small enough that the decks a reshuffle able Typical deck sizes range from as low as 30 cards as used by for instance Hearth stone to as high as 100 cards as in Magic The Gathering's Commander format Many CCG s limit how many copies of a particular card can be included in a deck such limits force players to think creatively when choosing cards and deciding on a playing strategy Cards come in several broad categories Common categories in addition to the aforementioned resource cards include creatures that are summoned into battle who attack the opposing player and block their creatures ' attacks enchantments that buff or de buff these creatures ' attributes and abilities events such as magic spells that may have an immediate or ongoing resolution to one or more cards in play and locations or story cards that present specific conditions impacting all actions 4 Each match is generally one on one but many games have variants for more players Typically the goal of a match is to play cards that reduce the opponent's life total to zero before the opponent can do the same Some games provide for a match to end if a player has no more cards to draw in their deck After determining which player goes first by coin flip or other means players start by shuffling their decks and drawing an initial hand Many games allow for a player to take a mulligan if they believe their starting hand is not good Players then take turns While the turn format is different depending on the game typically it is broken into distinct phases and all of their resources are reset so they may be used that turn Players draw a card play any number of cards by drawing from available resources and make one or more attacks on their opponent If necessary there may be a cleanup step including discarding cards to reach a maximum hand size Many games have rules enabling opposing players to react to the current player's turn for example a player may cast a counter spell to cancel an opponent's spell Games with such reaction systems typically define rules to determine the priority of reactions to avoid potential conflicts between card interpretations Other games do not have such direct reaction systems but allow players to cast face down cards or traps that automatically trigger based on the actions of the opposing player Specific game cards are most often produced in various degrees of scarcity generally denoted as fixed F common C uncommon U and rare R Some games use alternate or additional designations for the relative rarity levels such as super ultra mythic or exclusive rares Special cards may also only be available through promotions events purchase of related material or redemption programs The idea of rarity borrows somewhat from other types of collectible cards such as baseball cards but in CCG s the level of rarity also denotes the significance of a card's effect in the game i e the more powerful a card is in terms of the game the greater its rarity 21 A powerful card whose effects were underestimated by the game's designers may increase in rarity in later reprints Such a card might even be removed entirely from the next edition to further limit its availability and its effect on gameplay Most collectible card games are distributed as sealed packs containing a subset of the available cards much like trading cards The most common distribution methods are Because of the rarity distribution of cards many popular CCG s have a secondary marketplace with players buying and selling cards based on perceived value Many purchases are made to acquire rarer cards to help build competitive decks while others are just for collection purposes In some cases early cards in a CCG s run or which have been banned from play can become of high value to collectors such as Magic The Gathering's Power Nine 4 There are similar games usually inspired by CCG s that should not be mistaken for CCG s Many CCG s have also been remade into digital collectible card games DC CGs taking advantage of the ubiquity of the Internet for online play as well as for the potential of computerized opponents DC CGs can exist as online counterparts of existing CCG s such as Magic The Gathering Online for Magic the Gathering as wholly original card games that take advantage of the digital space such as Hearth stone or in many other forms 4 Regular card games have been around since at least the 1300 s The Base Ball Card Game a prototype from 1904 is a notable precursor to CCG s because it had a few similar qualities but it never saw production to qualify it as a collectible card game 27 It is not known if the game was intended to be a standalone product or something altogether different like Top Trumps 14 The game consisted of a limited 112 cards and never saw manufacture past the marketing stage 28 The first pre CCG to make it to market was the Baseball Card Game released by Topp s in 1951 as an apparent followup to a game from 1947 called Batter Up Baseball by Ed u Cards Corp Players created teams of hitters represented by cards and moved them around a baseball diamond according to cards representing baseball plays drawn from a randomized deck Like modern CCG s Topp s ' Baseball Card Game was sold in randomized packs and were collectible however it lacked the necessary strategic play that defines a CCG 29 Interaction between the two players was limited to who scored the most points and was otherwise a solitaire like function since players could not play simultaneously 30 Other notable entries that resemble and predate the CCG are Strat O Mati c Nuclear War Battle Cards and Illuminati 19 Allen Varney of Dragon Magazine claimed the designer of Cosmic Encounter published in 1979 Peter O lot ka spoke of the idea of designing a collectible card game as early as 1979 31 Prior to the advent of the CCG the market for alternative games was dominated by role playing games RPG in particular Dungeons Dragons by TSR Wizards of the Coast Wizards a new company formed in Peter A dk is on's basement in 1990 was looking to enter the RPG market with its series called The Primal Order which converted characters to other RPG series After a lawsuit from Palladium Books which could have financially ruined the company Wizards acquired another RPG called Tal is lant a This was after Lisa Stevens joined the company in 1991 as vice president after having left White Wolf Through their mutual friend Mike Davis A dk is on met Richard Garfield who at the time was a doctoral student Garfield and Davis had an idea for a game called Rob oRally and pitched the idea to Wizards of the Coast in 1991 but Wizards did not have the resources to manufacture it and instead challenged Garfield to make a game that would pay for the creation of Rob oRally This game would require minimal resources to make and only about 15 20 minutes to play 19 In December 1991 Garfield had a prototype for a game called Man a Clash and by 1993 he established Garfield Games to attract publishers and to get a larger share of the company should it become successful When designing Magic The Gathering Garfield borrowed elements from the board game Cosmic Encounter which also used cards for gameplay 32 and from Strat o Mati c baseball in which players build a team of players before the baseball game itself is played 33 In 1993 a new kind of card game appeared 32 It was different because the player could not buy all the cards at once Players would first buy starter decks and then later be encouraged to buy booster packs to expand their selection of cards What emerged was a card game that players collected and treasured but also played with 32 The first collectible card game created was Magic The Gathering invented by Richard Garfield and patented by Wizards of the Coast in 1993 17 19 32 34 35 36 37 The game has remained popular 38 with Wizards of the Coast claiming it to be the most widely played CCG as of 2009 39 note 2 It was based on Garfield's game Five Magic s from 1982 29 Originally Man a Clash was designed with Wizards in mind but the suit between Palladium Books and Wizards was still not settled Investment money was eventually secured from Wizards and the name Man a Clash was changed to Magic The Gathering The ads for it first appeared in Crypt y ch a magazine that focused on RPGs On 4 July weekend of 1993 the game premiered at the Origins Game Fair in Fort Worth Texas In the following month of August the game's Limited core set was released also known as Alpha and sold out its initial print run of 2 6 million cards immediately creating more demand Wizards quickly released a second print run called Beta 7 3 million card print run and then a second core set called Unlimited 35 million card print run in an attempt to satisfy orders as well as to fix small errors in the game December also saw the release of the first expansion called Arabian Nights With Magic The Gathering still the only CCG on the market it released another expansion called Antiquities which experienced collation problems Another core set iteration named Revised was released shortly after that Demand was still not satiated as the game grew by leaps and bounds Legends was released in mid 1994 and no end was in sight for the excitement over the new CCG 19 41 What followed was the CCG craze Magic was so popular that game stores could not satisfy the market demand More and more orders came for the product and as other game makers looked on they realized that they had to capitalize on this new fad The first to do so was TSR who rushed their own game Spell fire into production releasing it in June 1994 Through this period of time Magic was hard to obtain because production never kept pace with demand Store owners placed large inflated orders in an attempt to circumvent allocations placed by distributors This practice would eventually catch up to them when printing capacity met demand coinciding with the expansion of Fallen Empires released in November 1994 Combined with the releases of 9 other CCG s among them Galactic Empires Decipher's Star Trek On the Edge and Super Deck Steve Jackson Games which was heavily involved in the alternative game market looked to tap into the new CCG market and figured the best way was to adapt their existing Illuminati game The result was Illuminati New World Order which followed with two expansions in 1995 and 1998 Another entry by Wizards of the Coast was Jy had The game sold well but not nearly as well as Magic however it was considered a great competitive move by Wizard as Jy had was based on one of the most popular intellectual properties in the alternative game market which kept White Wolf from aggressively competing with Magic By this time however it may have been a moot point as the CCG Market had hit its first obstacle too much product The overprinted expansion of Magic's Fallen Empires threatened to upset the relationship that Wizards had with its distributors as many complained of getting too much product despite their original over ordering practices 19 42 43 In early 1995 the GAMA Trade Show previewed upcoming games for the year One out of every three games announced at the show was a CCG Publishers other than game makers were now entering the CCG market such as Don russ Upper Deck Flee r Topp s Comic Images and others The CCG bubble appeared to be on everyone's mind Too many CCG s were being released and not enough players existed to meet the demand In 1995 alone 38 CCG s entered the market the most notable among them being Doom trooper Middle earth OverPower Rage Shadow fist Legend of the Five Rings and SimCity Jy had saw a makeover and was renamed as Vampire The Eternal Struggle to distance itself from the Islamic term jihad as well as to get closer to the source material 19 The Star Trek CCG from Decipher was almost terminated after disputes with Paramount announced that the series would end in 1997 But by the end of the year the situation was resolved and Decipher regained the license to the Star Trek franchise along with Deep Space Nine Voyager and the movie First Contact 19 The enthusiasm from manufacturers was very high but by the summer of 1995 at Gen Con retailers had noticed CCG sales were lagging The Magic expansion Chronicles was released in November and was essentially a compilation of older sets It was maligned by collectors and they claimed it devalued their collections Besides this aspect the market was still reeling from too much product as Fallen Empires still s at on shelves alongside newer Magic expansions like Ice Age The one new CCG that retailers were hoping to save their sales Star Wars was not released until very late in December By then Wizards of the Coast the lead seller in the CCG market had announced a downsizing in their company and it was followed by a layoff of over 30 jobs The excess product and lag in sales also coincided with an eight month long gap between Magic The Gathering's expansions the longest in its history 19 42 In Hungary Power Cards Card Game or HK K was released in 1995 and was inspired by Magic The Gathering HK K was later released in the Czech Republic HK K is still being made 44 45 Garfield applied for a patent for a novel method of gameplay and game components that in one embodiment are in the form of trading cards that includes claims covering games whose rules include many of Magic's elements in combination including concepts such as changing the orientation of a game component to indicate use referred to in the Magic and Vampire The Eternal Struggle rules as tapping and constructing a deck by selecting cards from a larger pool 46 Garfield was granted the patent in 1997 which he then transferred the patent to Wizards of the Coast 47 The patent has aroused criticism from some observers who believe it may have stifled growth of other CCG s and looked to have some of its claims to be invalid 48 Peter A dk is on CEO of Wizards at the time remarked that his company was interested in striking a balance between the free flow of ideas and the continued growth of the game business with the ability to be compensated by others who incorporate our patented method of play into their games 49 A dk is on continued to say they had no intention of stifling the industry that originated from the success of Magic 49 In early 1996 the CCG market was still reeling from its recent failures and glut of products including the release of Wizards ' expansion Homelands which was rated as the worst Magic expansion to date The next two years would mark a cool off period for the over saturated CCG market Additionally manufacturers slowly came to understand that having a CCG was not enough to keep it alive They also had to support organized players through tournaments Combined with a new dichotomy between collectors and players especially among Magic players more emphasis was placed on the game rather than the collect i bil it y of the cards 19 Plenty more CCG s were introduced in 1996 chief among them were Battle Tech The X Files Mythos and Wizards ' very own Net runner Many established CCG s were in full swing releasing expansions every few months but even by this time many CCG s released only two years earlier had already been terminated TSR had ceased production of Spell fire and attempted another collectible game called Dragon Dice which failed shortly after being released 19 On 3 June 1997 Wizards of the Coast announced that it had acquired TSR and its Dungeons Dragons property which also gave them control of Gen Con 50 Wizards now had its long sought role playing game and it quickly discontinued all plans to continue producing Dragon Dice or resuming production of the Spell fire CCG Decipher was now sanctioning tournaments for their Star Trek and Star Wars games with the latter also enjoying strong success from the re released Star Wars Special Edition films The Star Wars CCG would remain the second best selling CCG until the introduction of Pok mon to the United States in 1999 19 Wizards continued acquiring properties and bought Five Rings Publishing Group Inc creators of the Legend of the Five Rings CCG Star Trek The Next Generation Collectible Dice Game and the soon to be released Dune CCG on 26 June 51 Wizards also acquired And on Unlimited which by association gave them control over the Origins Convention By September Wizards was awarded a patent for its Trading Card Game Later in October Wizards announced that it would seek royalty payments from other CCG companies Allegedly only Harper Prism announced its intention to pay these royalties for its game I maj ica Other CCG s acknowledged the patent on their packaging 19 20 42 1997 saw a slow down in the release of new CCG games Only 7 new games came out among them Dune Eye of the Storm Babylon 5 Shadow run I maj ica and Aliens Predator Babylon 5 saw moderate success for a few years before its publisher Precedence succumbed to a non renewal of its license later on in 2001 Also in 1997 Vampire The Eternal Struggle ceased production However Wizards of the Coast attempted to enter a more mainstream market with the release of a simplified version of Magic called Portal Its creation is considered a failure along with its follow up Portal Second Age released in 1998 19 By February 1998 one out of every two CCG s sold was Magic the Gathering 19 Only 7 new CCG s were introduced that year all but two being Wizards of the Coast product C 23 Doom town Hercules The Legendary Journeys Legend of the Burning Sands and Xena Warrior Princess were those five and only Doom town met with better than average reviews before its run was terminated and the rights returned to Alder ac C 23 Hercules and Xena were all a part of a new simplified CCG system Wizards had created for beginners Called the ARC System it had four distinct types of cards Resource Character Combat and Action The system also utilized the popular tapping mechanic of Magic The Gathering This system was abandoned shortly afterward 19 Despite limited success or no success at all in the rest of the CCG market Magic had recovered and Wizards learned from its lessons of 1995 and early 1996 Players still enjoyed the game and were acquiring its latest expansions of Tempest Stronghold Exodus and by year's end Urz a's Saga which added new enthusiasm to Magic's fanbase in light of some of the cards being too powerful 19 In early 1999 Wizards released the English language version of the Pok mon TCG to the mass market the original Japanese version of the game having been released by Media Factory in 1996 The game benefited from the Pok mon fad also of that year At first there was not enough product to meet demand Some retailers perceived the shortage to be in part related to Wizards ' recent purchase of the Game Keeper stores where it was assumed they received Pok mon shipments more often than non affiliated stores By the summer of 1999 the Pok mon TCG became the first CCG to outsell Magic The Gathering The success of Pok mon brought renewed interest to the CCG market and many new companies began pursuing this established customer base Large retail stores such as Walmart and Target began carrying CCG s and by the end of September Hasbro was convinced on its profitability and bought Wizards of the Coast for 325 million equivalent to 613 4 million in 2024 19 20 A small selection of new CCG s also arrived in 1999 among them Young Jedi Tomb Raider Austin Powers 7 th Sea and The Wheel of Time 19 By 2000 the volatility of the CCG market was familiar to its retailers They foresaw Pok mon's inevitable fall from grace as the fad reached its peak in April of that year The panic associated with the over flooding of the CCG s from 1995 and 1996 was absent and the retailers withstood the crash of Pok mon Yet CCG s benefited from the popularity of Pok mon and they saw an up tick in the number of CCG s released and an overall increased interest in the genre Pok mon's mainstream success in the CCG world also highlighted an increasing trend of CCG s being marketed with existing intellectual properties especially those with an existing television show such as an anime New CCG s introduced in 2000 included notable entries in Sailor Moon The Terminator Dig i Battle Dragon Ball Z Collectible Card Game Magi Nation and X Men Vampires The Eternal Struggle resumed production in 2000 after White Wolf regained full rights and released the first new expansion in three years called Sabbat War Wizards of the Coast introduced a new sports CCG called MLB Showdown as well 19 Decipher released its final chronological expansion of the original Star Wars trilogy called Death Star II and would continue to see a loss in sales as interest waned in succeeding expansions and their Star Wars license was not being renewed Mage Knight was also released this year and would seek to challenge the CCG market by introducing miniatures into the mix Though not technically a CCG it would target the same player base for sales The real shake up in the industry however came when Hasbro laid off more than 100 workers at Wizards of the Coast and ended its attempts at an online version of the game when it sold off the subsidiary's interactive division Coinciding with this turn of events was Peter Ad kiss on's decision to resign and Lisa Stevens whose job ended when The Duelist magazine published by Wizards of the Coast was canceled by the parent company With Ad kiss on went Wizards ' acquisition of Gen Con and the Origins Convention went to GAMA Hasbro also ceased production of Legends of the Five Rings in 2000 but its production resumed when after it was sold to Alder ac in 2001 19 42 The years 2001 and 2002 progressed with the CCG market being less likely to take risks on new and original intellectual properties but instead it would invest in CCG s that were based on existing franchises Cartoons movies television and books influenced the creation of such CCG s as Harry Potter The Lord of the Rings A Game of Thrones Buffy the Vampire Slayer Yu Gi Oh and two Star Wars CCG s Jedi Knights and a re booted Star Wars TCG by Decipher and Wizards of the Coast They followed the demise of the original Star Wars CCG by Decipher in December 2001 but they would see very little interest and eventually the two games were canceled Other niche CCG s were also made including Warlord Saga of the Storm and Warhammer 40 000 19 20 Upper Deck had its first hit with Yu Gi Oh The game was known to be popular in Japan but until 2002 had not been released in the United States The game was mostly distributed to national retailers with hobby stores added to their distribution afterward By the end of 2002 the game was the top CCG even though it was nowhere near the phenomenon that Pok mon was The card publisher Precedence produced a new CCG in 2001 based on the Rifts RPG by Palladium Rifts had top of the line artwork but the size of the starter deck was similar in size to the RPG books Precedence's other main CCG Babylon 5 ended its decent run in 2001 after the company lost its license The game was terminated and the publisher later folded in 2002 The release of The Lord of the Rings TCG marked the release of the 100 th new CCG since 1993 and 2002 also marked the release of the 500 th CCG expansion for all CCG s The Lord of the Rings TCG briefly beat out sales of Magic for a few months 20 Magic continued a steady pace releasing successful expansion blocks with Odyssey and Onslaught Decipher released The Motion Pictures expansion for the Star Trek CCG and also announced that it would be the last expansion for the game Decipher then released the Second Edition for the Star Trek CCG which refined the rules re booted the game and introduced new card frames Collectible miniature games continued their effort to take market share away from the CCG market with the releases of He roC lix and Me ch Warrior in 2002 but saw limited success 20 The next few years saw an increase in the number of companies willing to start a new CCG partly owing to the success of Pok mon and Yu Gi Oh New CCG s entered the market many of which tried to continue the trend of franchise tie in s Notable entries include The Simpsons SpongeBob SquarePants Neopets G I Joe He ca tomb Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and many others Duel Masters was introduced to the United States after strong popularity in Japan the preceding two years Wizards of the Coast published it for a couple of years before weak sales resulted in its cancellation Two Warhammer CCG s were released with Horus Heresy and War Cry Horus Heresy lasted two years and was succeeded by Dark Millennium in 2005 Also two entries from Decipher were released one that passed the torch from their Star Wars CCG to WARS WARS kept most of the gameplay mechanics from their Star Wars game but transferred them to a new and original setting The game did not do particularly well and after two expansions the game was canceled in 2005 The other new CCG was hack Enemy which won an Origins award The game was also canceled in 2005 52 Plenty of other CCG s were attempted by various publishers many that were based on Japanese manga such as Beyblade Gundam War One Piece Inuyasha Zatch Bell Case Closed and YuYu Hakusho Existing CCG s were reformatted or re booted including Dragon Ball Z as Dragon Ball GT and Digimon D Te ctor as the Digimon Collectible Card Game An interesting CCG released by Upper Deck was called the Vs System It incorporated the Marvel and DC Comics universes and pitted the heroes and villains from those universes against one another Similarly the game UF S The Universal Fighting System used characters from Street Fighter Soul Calibur Tekken Mega Man Dark stalkers etc This CCG was obtained by J asco Games in 2010 and is currently still being made Another CCG titled Call of Cthulhu was the spiritual successor to Mythos by the publisher Chaos i um Chaos i um licensed the game to Fantasy Flight Games who produced the CCG Probably one of the biggest developments in the CCG market was the release of Magic's 8 th Edition core set It introduced a redesigned card border and it would later mark the beginning of a new play format titled Modern that utilized cards from this set onward Another development was Pok mon originally published in English by Wizards having its publishing rights transferred to Pok mon USA Inc in June 2003 The previous year's influx of new CCG s continued into 2006 Riding on the success of the popular PC Game World of Warcraft Blizzard Entertainment licensed Upper Deck to publish a TCG based on the game The World of Warcraft TCG was born and was carried by major retailers but saw limited success until it was discontinued in 2013 prior to the release of Blizzard's digital card game Hearth stone Following previous trends Japanese influenced CCG s continued to enter the market These games were either based on cartoons anime or manga and included Naruto Avatar The Last Airbender Bleach Rangers Strike and the classic series Robot ech Dragon Ball GT was re booted once again in 2008 and renamed as Dragon Ball Many other franchises were made into CCG s with a few reboot s Notable ones included Card fight Vanguard Conan Battlestar Galactica Power Rangers 24 TCG Red akai Mons uno and others as well as another attempt at Doctor Who in the United Kingdom and Australia Publisher Alder ac released the City of Heroes CCG based on the City of Heroes PC game Another video game Kingdom Hearts for the PS 2 was turned into the Kingdom Hearts TCG by To my A few other CCG s were released only in other countries and never made it overseas to English speaking countries including Monster Hunter of Japan and Van daria Wars id of Indonesia By the end of 2008 trouble was brewing between Konami who owned the rights to Yu Gi Oh and its licensee Upper Deck Meanwhile strong sales continued with the three top CCG s of Pok mon Yu Gi Oh and Magic the Gathering The Warhammer series Dark Millennium ended its run in 2007 Magic the Gathering saw a large player boom in 2009 with the release of the Zend i kar expansion The spike in the number of Magic players continued for a few years and leveled off by 2015 53 Interest also developed with their multiplayer format called Commander This increase in the player base created a Magic subculture based on finance speculation New players entering the market from 2009 to 2015 desired cards that were printed before 2009 and with smaller print runs Demand outstripped quantity and prices of certain cards increased and speculators started to directly manipulate the Magic card market to their advantage This eventually attracted the interest of the controversial figure Martin Sh kr eli former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals for a brief period of time 54 Prices of cards from previous sets increased dramatically and the American market saw an influx of Chinese counterfeits capitalizing on the demand This created a unique situation where the most desirable and expensive cards could be printed by counterfeiters but not by the brand owner due to a promise made with collectors in 1996 and refined in 2011 55 56 In 2015 Wizards of the Coast implemented more anti counterfeit measures by introducing a holographic foil on to cards with specific rarities in addition to creating a proprietary font 57 58 Between the time period of 2008 to 2016 Magic the Gathering sold over 20 billion cards 10 A rise in tie in collectible card games continued with the introduction of the My Little Pony Collectible Card Game It was licensed to Enter play LLC by Hasbro and published on 13 December 2013 59 The collectible cards according to president Dean Irwin proved to be moderately successful so Enter play reprinted the premiere release set mid February 2014 59 Other tie in games released included the Final Fantasy Trading Card Game and Star Wars Destiny which had collectible cards and dice which after a 3 year run ended production in early 2020 Force of Will was released in 2012 in Japan and in 2013 in English but as an original intellectual property One of the longest running CCG s Legend of the Five Rings released its final set Evil Portents for free in 2015 After a 20 year
