various genres and it is available internationally in multiple languages 6 Launched in 2007 nearly a decade after Netflix Inc began its pioneering DVD by mail movie rental service Netflix is the most subscribed video on demand streaming media service with 301 6 million paid memberships in more than 190 countries as of 2025 5 7 By 2022 Netflix Original productions accounted for half of its library

website in the world with 21 18 of its traffic coming from the United States followed by the United Kingdom at 6 01 Canada at 4 94 and Brazil at 4 24 8 9 Netflix was founded by Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings on August 29 1997 in Scotts Valley California Hastings a computer scientist and mathematician was a co founder of Pure Software which was acquired by Rational Software that year for 750 million the then biggest acquisition in Silicon Valley history 10 Randolph had worked as a marketing director for Pure Software after Pure Atria acquired a company where Randolph worked He was previously a co founder of Micro Warehouse a computer mail order company as well as vice president of marketing for Borland 11 12 Hastings and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while carpooling between their homes in Santa Cruz California and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale 13 Patty McCord later head of human resources at Netflix was also in the car pool group 14 Randolph admired Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the Internet using a similar model Hastings and Randolph considered and rejected selling and renting VHS as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship 11 When they heard about DVDs first introduced in the United States in early 1997 they tested the concept of online DVD rental or sales by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings's house in Santa Cruz 11 When the CD arrived intact they decided to enter the 16 billion Home video sales and rental industry 11 13 a Hastings invested 2 5 million into Netflix from the sale of Pure Atria 16 13 Netflix launched as the first DVD rental and sales website with 30 employees and 925 titles available nearly all DVDs published 13 17 18 Randolph and Hastings met with Jeff Bezos whose Amazon offered to acquire Netflix for between 14 and 16 million Fearing competition from Amazon Randolph thought the offer was fair but Hastings who owned 70 of the company turned it down on the plane ride home 19 20 Not restricted to the size of a retail store Netflix could offer hundreds of thousands of DVDs to customers in along tail business model Early employee Cindy Holland compared the company acquiring DVDs to shoveling coal in the side door of the house 15 Initially Netflix offered a per rental model for each DVD but introduced a monthly subscription concept in September 1999 21 The per rental model was dropped by early 2000 allowing the company to focus on the business model of flat fee unlimited rentals without due dates late fees shipping and handling fees or per title rental fees 22 While customers enjoyed the convenience more important to Netflix was that it did not have to store or ship those DVDs subscribers ' homes acted as warehouses The company secretly slowed deliveries to heavy users pigs to discourage them from quickly returning DVDs 15 In September 2000 during the dot com bubble while Netflix was suffering losses Hastings and Randolph offered to sell the company to Blockbuster for 50 million John Anti o co CEO of Blockbuster thought the offer was a joke and declined saying The dot com hysteria is completely overblown 23 24 While Netflix experienced fast growth in early 2001 the continued effects of the dot com bubble collapse and the September 11 attacks caused the company to hold off plans for its initial public offering IPO and to lay off one third of its 120 employees 25 DVD players were a popular gift for holiday sales in late 2001 and demand for DVD subscription services were growing like crazy according

Blockbuster's service reached two million users and while trailing Netflix's subscriber count was drawing business away from Netflix Netflix lowered fees in 2007 29 While it was an urban legend that Netflix ultimately killed Blockbuster in the DVD rental market Blockbuster's debt load and internal disagreements hurt the company 31 On April 4 2006 Netflix filed a patent infringement lawsuit in which it demanded a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that Blockbuster's online DVD rental subscription program violated two patents held by Netflix The first cause of action alleged Blockbuster's infringement of copying the dynamic queue of DVDs available for each customer Netflix's method of using the ranked preferences in the queue to send DVDs to subscribers and Netflix's method permitting the queue to be updated and reordered 32 The second cause of action alleged infringement of the subscription rental service as well as

always streaming media and that Netflix rented DVDs only to grow its customer base for streaming 15 By the mid 2000 s data speeds and bandwidth costs improved sufficiently to allow customers to download movies from the internet The original idea was a Netflix box that could download movies overnight and be ready to watch the next day By 2005 Netflix had acquired movie rights and designed the

content has also been criticized by disability rights movement advocates for lack of closed captioning quality 523 Some media organizations and competitors have criticized Netflix for selectively releasing ratings and viewer numbers of its original programming The company has made claims boasting about viewership records without providing data to substantiate its successes or using problematic estimation methods 524 In March 2020 some government agencies called for Netflix and other streamers to limit services due to increased broadband and energy consumption as use of the platform
