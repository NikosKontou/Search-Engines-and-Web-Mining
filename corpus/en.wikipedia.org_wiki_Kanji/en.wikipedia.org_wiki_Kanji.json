Japanese 4 They comprised a major part of the Japanese writing system during the time of Old Japanese and are still used today along with the subsequently derived syllabic phonographic scripts of hiragana and katakana 5 6 The most Kanji characters have two pronunciations kun ' yomi based on the sounds of vernacular Japanese where the Kanji is often phonetically transcribed with fur i gana in addition and on ' yom o based on the imitation of the original Middle Chinese sound when it was borrowed from written Chinese Some Kanji characters were indigenously invented in Japan by constructing character components derived from other Chinese characters After the Meiji Restoration Japan made its own efforts to simplify the Kanji characters now known as shinji tai ' new character form ' by a process similar to China's simplification efforts with the intention to increase literacy among the general public Since the 1920 s the Japanese government has published character lists periodically to help direct the education of its citizenry through the myriad Chinese characters that exist There are nearly 3 000 kanji used in Japanese names and in common communication The term kanji is a direct borrowing and phonetic reading on ' yomi of the Chinese word hanzi traditional Chinese simplified Chinese pinyin h nz which is one of the formal terms used when referring to Chinese characters 7 8 The significant use of Chinese characters in Japan first began to take hold around the 5 th century AD and has since had a profound influence in shaping Japanese culture language literature history and records 9 Ink stone artifacts at archaeological sites dating back to the earlier Yayoi period were also found to contain Chinese characters 10 Although some characters as used in Japanese and Chinese have similar meanings and pronunciations others have meanings or pronunciations that are unique to one language or the other For example means ' honest ' in both languages but is pronounced makoto or sei in Japanese and ch ng in Standard Mandarin Chinese Individual kanji characters and multi kanji words invented in Japan from Chinese morphemes have been borrowed into Chinese Korean and Vietnamese in recent times These are known as Was ei kango or Japanese made Chinese words For example the word for telephone de nwa in Japanese was derived from the Chinese words for electric and conversation It was then cal queda sdi nhu in Mandarin Chinese i n tho i in Vietnamese and jeon hwa in Korean 11 Chinese characters first came to Japan on official seals letters swords coins mirrors and other decorative items imported from China 12 The earliest known instance of such an import was the King of Na gold seal given by Emperor Guang wu of Han to aWa emissary in 57 AD 13 Chinese coins as well a sink stones from the first century AD have also been found in Yayoi period archaeological sites 9 10 However the Japanese people of that era probably had little to no comprehension of the script and they would remain relatively illiterate until the fifth century AD when writing in Japan became more widespread 9 According to the Nihon Shoki and Kojiki a semi legendary scholar called Wan i was dispatched to Japan by the Kingdom of Baekje during the reign of Emperor j in in the early fifth century bringing with him knowledge of Confucianism and Chinese characters 14 The earliest Japanese documents were probably written by bilingual Chinese or Korean officials employed at the Yamato court 9 For example the diplomatic correspondence from King Bu of Wa to Emperor Shun of Liu Song in 478 AD has been praised for its skillful use of allusion Later groups of people called fu hito were organized under the monarch to read and write Classical Chinese During the reign of Empress Suiko 593 628 the Yamato court began sending full scale diplomatic missions to China which resulted in a large increase in Chinese literacy at the Japanese court 14 In ancient times paper was so rare that people wrote kanji on to thin rectangular strips of wood called mok kan These wooden boards were used for communication between government offices tags for goods transported between various countries and the practice of writing The oldest written kanji in Japan discovered so far were written in ink on wood as a wooden strip dated to the 7 th century a record of trading for cloth and salt 15 The Japanese language had no written form at the time Chinese characters were introduced and texts were written and read only in Chinese Later during the Heian period 794 1185 a system known ask an bun emerged which involved using Chinese text with diacritical marks to allow Japanese speakers to read Chinese sentences and restructure them into Japanese on the fly by changing word order and adding particles and verb endings in accordance with the rules of Japanese grammar This was essentially a kind of codified sight translation citation needed Chinese characters also came to be used to write texts in the vernacular Japanese language resulting in the modern kana syllabaries Around 650 AD a writing system called man ' y gana used in the ancient poetry anthology Man ' y sh evolved that used a number of Chinese characters for their sound rather than for their meaning Man ' y gana written in cursive style evolved into hiragana literally fluttering kana in reference to the motion of the brush during cursive writing or onna de that is ladies ' hand 16 a writing system that was accessible to women who were denied higher education Major works of Heian era literature by women were written in hiragana Katakana literally partial kana in reference to the practice of using a part of a kanji character emerged via a parallel path monastery students simplified man ' y gana to a single constituent element Thus the two other writing systems hiragana and katakana referred to collectively as kana are descended from kanji In contrast with kana literally borrowed name in reference to the character being borrowed as a label for its sound kanji are also called man a literally true name in reference to the character being used as a label for its meaning citation needed In modern Japanese kanji are used to write certain words or parts of words usually content words such as nouns adjective stems and verb stems while hiragana are used to write inflected verb and adjective endings phonetic complements to disambiguate readings okur i gana particles and miscellaneous words which have no kanji or whose kanji are considered obscure or too difficult to read or remember Katakana are mostly used for representing onomatopoeia non Japanese loanwords except those borrowed from ancient Chinese the names of plants and animals with exceptions and for emphasis on certain words citation needed Since ancient times there has been a strong opinion in Japan that kanji is the orthodox form of writing but others have argued against it 17 Kamo no Mab uchi a scholar of the Edo period criticized the large number of characters in kanji He also appreciated the small number of characters in kana characters and argued for the limitation of kanji citation needed After the Meiji Restoration and as Japan entered an era of active exchange with foreign countries the need for script reform in Japan began to be called for Some scholars argued for the abolition of kanji and the writing of Japanese using only kana or Latin characters These views were not widespread 18 However the need to limit the number of kanji characters was understood and in May 1923 the Japanese government announced 1 962 kanji characters for regular use In 1940 the Japanese Army decided on the Table of Restricted Kanji for Weapons Names he iki meish y sei gen kanji hy which limited the number of kanji that could be used for weapons names to 1 235 In 1942 the National Language Council announced the Standard Kanji Table hy jun kanji hy with a total of 2 528 characters showing the standard for kanji used by ministries and agencies and in general society 19 In 1946 after World War II and under the Allied occupation of Japan the Japanese government guided by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers instituted a series of orthographic reforms to help children learn and to simplify kanji use in literature and periodicals citation needed The number of characters in circulation was reduced and formal lists of characters to be learned during each grade of school were established Some characters were given simplified glyphs called shinji tai Many variant forms of characters and obscure alternatives for common characters were officially discouraged citation needed These are simply guidelines so many characters outside these standards are still widely known and commonly used these are known ashy ga iji citation needed The ky i ku kanji lit education kanji are the 1 026 first kanji characters that Japanese children learn in elementary school from first grade to sixth grade The grade level breakdown is known as the gaku nen be tsu kanji hait hy or the ga kush kanji This list of kanji is maintained by the Japanese Ministry of Education and prescribes which kanji characters and which kanji readings students should learn for each grade The j y kanji regular use kanji are 2 136 characters consisting of all the ky i ku kanji plus 1 110 additional kanji taught in junior high and high school 20 In publishing characters outside this category are often given fur i gana The j y kanji were introduced in 1981 replacing an older list of 1 850 characters known as the t y kanji general use kanji introduced in 1946 Originally numbering 1 945 characters the j y kanji list was expanded to 2 136 in 2010 Some of the new characters were previously j in mei y kanji some are used to write prefecture names and As of September 25 2017 the j in mei y kanji kanji for use in personal names consists of 863 characters Kanji on this list are mostly used in people's names and some are traditional variants of j y kanji There were only 92 kanji in the original list published in 1952 but new additions have been made frequently Sometimes the term j in mei y kanji refers to all 2 999 kanji from both the j y and j in mei y lists combined Hy gai kanji unlisted characters are any kanji not contained in the j y kanji and j in mei y kanji lists These are generally written using traditional characters but extended shinji tai forms exist The Japanese Industrial Standards for kanji and kana define character code points for each kanji and kana as well as other forms of writing such as the Latin alphabet Cyrillic script Greek alphabet Arabic numerals etc for use in information processing They have had numerous revisions The current standards are Ga iji literally external characters are kanji that are not represented in existing Japanese encoding systems These include variant forms of common kanji that need to be represented alongside the more conventional glyph in reference works and can include non kanji symbols as well Ga iji can be either user defined characters system specific characters or third party add on products 24 Both are a problem for information interchange as the code point used to represent an external character will not be consistent from one computer or operating system to another Ga iji were nominally prohibited in J IS X 0208 1997 where the available number of code points was reduced to only 940 25 J IS X 0213 2000 used the entire range of code points previously allocated toga iji making them completely unusable Most desktop and mobile systems have moved to Unicode negating the need for ga iji for most users Historically ga iji were used by Japanese mobile service providers fore moji Unicode allows for optional encoding of ga iji in private use areas while Adobe's SING Smart INdependent Glyph lets 26 27 technology allows the creation of customized ga iji The Text Encoding Initiative uses a g element to encode any non standard character or glyph including ga iji The g stands for ga iji 28 29 There is no definitive count of kanji characters just as there is none of Chinese characters generally The Dai Kan Wa Ji ten which is considered to be comprehensive in Japan contains about 50 000 characters The Zhong hua Zi hai published in 1994 in China contains about 85 000 characters but the majority of them are not in common use in any country and many are obscure variants or archaic forms 30 31 32 A list of 2 136 j y kanji is regarded as necessary for functional literacy in Japanese Approximately a thousand more characters are commonly used and readily understood by the majority in Japan and a few thousand more find occasional use particularly in specialized fields of study but those may be obscure to most out of context A total of 13 108 characters can be encoded in various Japanese Industrial Standards for kanji Individual kanji may be used to write one or more different words or morphemes leading to different pronunciations or readings The correct reading may be determined by contextual cues such as whether the character represents part of a compound word versus an independent word the exact intended meaning of the word and its position within the sentence For example is mostly read ky meaning today but in formal writing it is read kon n ichi meaning nowadays Fur i gana is used to specify ambiguous readings such as rare literary or otherwise non standard readings 33 Readings are categorized as either kun ' yomi literally meaning reading native Japanese or on ' yomi literally sound reading borrowed from Chinese Most kanji have at least a single reading of each category though some have only one such a ski ku chrysanthemum an on reading ori was hi sardine a kun reading Japanese coined kanji koku ji often only have kun ' yomi readings Some common kanji have ten or more possible readings the most complex common example is which is read as sei sh nama ki o u i kir u i k as u i ker u u mu u mare ru ha eru and ha yas u totaling eight basic readings the first two are on while the rest are kun or 12 if related verbs are counted as distinct The on ' yomi o j omi lit sound based reading the Sino Japanese reading is the modern descendant of the Japanese approximation of the base Chinese pronunciation of the character at the time it was introduced It was often previously referred to as translation reading as it was recreated readings of the Chinese pronunciation but was not the Chinese pronunciation or reading itself similar to the English pronunciation of Latin loanwords There also exist kanji created by the Japanese and given an on ' yomi reading despite not being a Chinese derived or a Chinese originating character Some kanji were introduced from different parts of China at different times and so have multiple on ' yomi and often multiple meanings Kanji invented in Japan koku ji would not normally be expected to have on ' yomi but there are exceptions such as the character to work which has the kun ' yomi hat ara ku and the on ' yomi d and gland which has only the on ' yomi sen in both cases these come from the on ' yomi of the phonetic component respectively d and sen The kun ' yomi k j omi lit meaning reading the native reading is a reading based on the pronunciation of a native Japanese word or yamato ko toba that closely approximated the meaning of the Chinese character when it was introduced As with on ' yomi there can be multiple kun ' yomi for the same kanji and some kanji have no kun ' yomi at all Ate ji are characters used only for their sounds In this case pronunciation is still based on a standard reading or used only for meaning broadly a form of ate ji narrowly juku ji kun Therefore only the full compound not the individual character has a reading There are also special cases where the reading is completely different often based on a historical or traditional reading The analogous phenomenon occurs to a much lesser degree in Chinese varieties where there are literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters borrowed readings and native readings In Chinese these borrowed readings and native readings are etymologically related since they are between Chinese varieties which are related not from Chinese to Japanese which are not related They thus form doublets and are generally similar analogous to different on ' yomi reflecting different stages of Chinese borrowing s into Japanese Longer readings exist for non J y characters and non kanji symbols where a long gair a igo word may be the reading this is classed as kun ' yomi see single character gair a igo below the character has the seven kana reading s enc him toru centimeter though it is generally written as cm with two half width characters so occupying one space another common example is ' ' the percent sign which has the five kana reading p sen to There are many kanji compounds that use a mixture of on ' yomi and kun ' yomi these may be considered hybrid words Readings in which the first kanji is on ' yomi and the second is kun ' yomi are classified as j bak o yomi multi layered food box reading while kun on words are classified asyut yomi hot liquid pail reading The words j bak o and yut are themselves examples of the reading patterns they represent they are auto logical words Other examples include basho place kun on kin ' i ro golden on kun and aiki d the martial art Aikido kun on on Ate ji often use mixed readings For instance the city of Sapporo whose name derives from the Ainu language and has no meaning in Japanese is written with the on kun compound sapporo which includes sokuon as if it were a purely on compound Gik un and juku ji kun are readings of kanji combinations that have no direct correspondence to the characters ' individual on ' yomi or kun ' yomi From the point of view of the character rather than the word this is known as an an kun difficult reading and these are listed in kanji dictionaries under the entry for the character Gik un are other readings assigned to a character instead of its standard readings An example is reading meaning cold as fu yu winter rather than the standard readings samu or kan and instead of the usual spelling for fu yu of Another example is using lit ' smoke grass ' with the reading tabak o tobacco rather than the otherwise expected readings of ke muri gus a or ens Some of these such as for tabak o have become lexical i zed but in many cases this kind of use is typically non standard and employed in specific contexts by individual writers Aided with fur i gana gik un could be used to convey complex literary or poetic effect especially if the readings contradict the kanji or clarification if the referent may not be obvious Juku ji kun are when the standard kanji for a word are related to the meaning but not the sound The word is pronounced as a whole not corresponding to sounds of individual kanji For example this morning is juku ji kun This word is not read as im a ' as a the expected kun ' yomi of the characters and only infrequently ask on ch the on ' yomi of the characters The most common reading is kes a a native bi syllabic Japanese word that may be seen as a single morpheme or as a compound of ke this as in ke fu the older reading for today and as a morning 34 Likewise today is also juku ji kun usually read with the native reading ky its on ' yomi kon n ichi does occur in certain words and expressions especially in the broader sense nowadays or current such as present day although in the phrase kon n ichi wa good day kon n ichi is typically spelled wholly with hiragana rather than with the kanji Juku ji kun are primarily used for some native Japanese words such as Yamato or the name of the dominant ethnic group of Japan a former Japanese province as well as ancient name for Japan and for some old borrowing s such as s his hamo literally willow leaf fish from Ainu tabak o literally smoke grass from Portuguese or b ru literally wheat alcohol from Dutch especially if the word was borrowed before the Meiji period Words whose kanji are juku ji kun are often usually written as hiragana if native or katakana if borrowed some old borrowed words are also written as hiragana especially Portuguese loanwords such as karuta from Portuguese carta English card or tempura from Portuguese tempor a English times season citation needed as well as tabak o A case where juku ji kunis used for Sino Japanese is the word ky dai which proto typically means brothers and is spelt big and little brothers However the meaning has been expanded to siblings in general and can assume such spellings as big and little sisters alternatively pronounced shima i big brother and little sister and big sister and little brother It is also possible to say o toko ky dai male siblings brothers and onna ky dai female siblings sisters 35 Sometimes juku ji kun can even have more kanji than there are syllables examples being ker a woodpecker gum i silver berry ol easter 36 and Hozumi a surname 37 This phenomenon is observed in animal names that are shortened and used as suffixes for zoological compound names for example when normally read ask ogane mush i is shortened tok ogane in kuro koga ne although zoological names are commonly spelled with katakana rather than with kanji Outside zoology this type of shortening only occurs on a handful of words for example dai gen sui or the historical male name suffix em on which was shortened from the word ue mon The kanji compound for juku ji kunis often idiosyncratic and created for the word and there is no corresponding Chinese word with that spelling In other cases a kanji compound for an existing Chinese word is reused where the Chinese word and on ' yomi may or may not be used in Japanese For example reindeer is juku ji kun for to nakai from Ainu but the on ' yomi reading of jun roku is also used In some cases Japanese coinages have subsequently been borrowed back into Chinese such as ank monk fish The underlying word for juku ji kunis a native Japanese word or foreign borrowing which either does not have an existing kanji spelling either kun ' yomi orate ji or for which a new kanji spelling is produced Most often the word is a noun which may be a simple noun not a compound or derived from a verb or may be a verb form or a fusion al pronunciation For example the word sum sumo is originally from the verb sum au to vie to compete while ky today is fusion al from older ke this fu day In rare cases juku ji kunis also applied to inflectional words verbs and adjectives in which case there is frequently a corresponding Chinese word The most common example of an inflectional juku ji kunis the adjective kawai i cute originally kawa fay u i the word is used in Chinese but the corresponding on ' yomi is not used in Japanese By contrast appropriate can be either fu saw a shii as juku ji kun or s as on ' yomi Which reading to use can be discerned by the presence or absence of the shii ending okur i gana A common example of a verb with juku ji kunis haya ru to spread to be in vogue corresponding to on ' yomi ry k A sample juku ji kun de verbal noun derived from a verb form is yu suri extortion from yus u ru to extort spelling from ky sei extortion Note that there are also compound verbs and less commonly compound adjectives and while these may have multiple kanji without intervening characters they are read using the usual kun ' yomi Examples include omo shiro i interesting literally face white and zur u gas hi ko i sly lit cunning crafty clever smart Typographically the fur i gana for juku ji kun are often written so they are centered across the entire word or for inflectional words over the entire root corresponding to the reading being related to the entire word rather than each part of the word being centered over its corresponding character as is often done for the usual ph ono semantic readings In some rare cases kanji may have a reading borrowed from a modern foreign language gair a igo though usually gair a igo are written in katakana Notable examples include p ji page bot an button zero zero and m toru meter These are classed as kun ' yomi because the character is used for its meaning the kun ' yomi label may sometimes be misleading since most kun ' yomi are native Japanese readings The readings are also rendered in katakana unlike the usual hiragana for native kun ' yomi Note that most of these characters are for units particularly SI units in many cases using new characters koku ji coined during the Meiji period such a ski rom toru kilometer meter thousand Some kanji also have lesser known readings called na nori which are mostly used for names often given names and in general are closely related to the kun ' yomi Place names sometimes also use na nori or occasionally unique readings not found elsewhere Although there are general rules for when to use on ' yomi and when to use kun ' yomi many kanji have multiple on or kun readings and the language is littered with exceptions how a character was meant to be read is sometimes ambiguous even to native speakers this is especially true for names both of people and places A single kanji followed by okur i gana hiragana forming part of a word such as the inflect able suffixes forming native verbs and adjectives like akai red and mir u to see always indicates kun ' yomi Okur i gana can indicate which kun ' yomi to use as in ta beru versus ku u both meaning to eat but this is not always sufficient as in which may be read as a ku or hira ku both meaning to open Kanji compounds juku ji especially yo ji juku go usually but not always use on ' yomi usually but not always kan on Inge do ku detoxification anti poison is read with its kan on reading instead of its more common go on reading kai Exceptions are common j h information for example is go kan gy nik u beef and y nik u mutton have on on readings but but a nik u pork and tori nik u poultry have kun on readings Examples of fully kun ' yomi compounds include te gam i letter hig as a parasol and the in famous kamikaze divine wind Some kun ' yomi compounds have non inflect ive okur i gana such as kara age Chinese style fried chicken and origami many can also be written with the okur i gana omitted Kanji in isolation are typically read using their kun ' yomi exceptions include the on ' yomi a i love Zen and ten mark dot Most of these on ' yomi cases involve kanji that have no kun ' yomi For kanji with multiple common isolated readings such as which may be read a skin gold or kane money metal only context can determine the intended reading The isolated kanji versus compound distinction gives words for similar concepts completely different pronunciations Alone north and east use the kun ' yo mikita and higashi but northeast uses the on ' yomi hoku t Inconsistencies also occur between compounds is read as sei in sensei teacher but as sh in is sh one's whole life both on ' yomi Multiple readings have given rise to a number of homographs in some cases having different meanings depending on how they are read One example is which can be read in three different ways j zu skilled uwa te upper part or kami te stage left house right In addition has the reading uma i skilled More subtly has three different readings all meaning tomorrow as hit a casual as u polite and my n ichi formal Conversely some terms are homo ph ono us but not homo graphic and thus ambiguous in speech but not in writing To remedy this alternate readings may be used for conf usable words For example privately established esp school and municipal are both normally pronounced shi r its u in speech these may be distinguished by the alternative pronunciation swat a kush i r its u and ichi r its u More informally in legal jargon preamble and full text are both pronounced zen bun so may be pronounced mae bun for clarity as in Have you memorized the preamble not ' whole text ' of the constitution As in these examples this is primarily done using a kun ' yomi for one character in a normally on ' yomi term Certain words take different readings depending on whether the context concerns legal matters or not For example In some instances where even context cannot easily provide clarity for homophones alternative readings or mixed readings can be used instead of regular readings to avoid ambiguity For example kai shun buying sex yut 40 j shima i female cousin on j kei older male cousin on j shi older female cousin on j tei younger male cousin on j mai younger female cousin on koto ten encyclopedia yut 40 38 moji ten character dictionary irregular from moji character 40 bake gaku chemistry yut 40 38 to gary misdemeanor fine yut 40 38 Kino e tatsu Greater Wood Dragon year kun Kano es aru Greater Fire Monkey year kun Kano e tatsu Greater Fire Dragon year kun Susumu shin J in irregular from the alternative reading Susumu used as a personal name 40 38 wat a kush iri tsu private yut 40 38 There are also cases where the words are technically he t ero phones but they have similar meanings and pronunciations therefore liable to mi shearing and misunderstanding Several famous place names including those of Japan itself Nihon or sometimes Nippon those of some cities such as Tokyo T ky and Kyoto Ky to and those of the main islands Honshu Honsh Kyushu Ky sh Shikoku Shikoku and Hokkaido Hokkaid are read with on ' yomi however the majority of Japanese place names are read with kun ' yomi saka Aomori Hak one Names often use characters and readings that are not in common use outside of names When characters are used as abbreviations of place names their reading may not match that in the original The Osaka and Kobe baseball team the Hanshin Tigers take their name from the on ' yomi of the second kanji of saka and the first of K be The name of the Keisei railway line linking Tokyo and Narita is formed similarly although the reading of from is kei despite ky already being an on ' yomi in the word T ky Japanese family names are also usually read with kun ' yomi Yamada Tanaka Suzuki Japanese given names often have very irregular readings Although they are not typically considered j bak o or yut they often contain mixtures of kun ' yomi on ' yomi and na nori such as Daisuke on kun Natsumi kun on Being chosen at the discretion of the parents the readings of given names do not follow any set rules and it is impossible to know with certainty how to read a person's name without independent verification Parents can be quite creative and rumors abound of children called su Earth and En j eru Angel neither are common names and have normal readings chi ky and ten shi respectively Some common Japanese names can be written in multiple ways e g Akira can be written as and many other characters and kanji combinations not listed 43 Satoshi can be written as etc 44 and Haruka can be written as and several other possibilities 45 Common patterns do exist however allowing experienced readers to make a good guess for most names To alleviate any confusion on how to pronounce the names of other Japanese people most official Japanese documents require Japanese to write their names in both kana and kanji 37 Chinese place names and Chinese personal names appearing in Japanese texts if spelled in kanji are almost invariably read with on ' yomi Especially for older and well known names the resulting Japanese pronunciation may differ widely from that used by modern Chinese speakers For example Mao Zedong's name is pronounced as M Taku t in Japanese and the name of the legendary Monkey King Sun Wu kong is pronounced Son Go k in Japanese Today Chinese names that are not well known in Japan are often spelled in katakana instead in a form much more closely approximating the native Chinese pronunciation Alternatively they may be written in kanji with katakana fur i gana Many such cities have names that come from non Chinese languages like Mongolian or Manchu Examples of such not well known Chinese names include Internationally renowned Chinese named cities tend to imitate the older English pronunciations of their names regardless of the kanji's on ' yomi or the Mandarin or Cantonese pronunciation and can be written in either katakana or kanji Examples include Notes In some cases the same kanji can appear in a given word with different readings Normally this occurs when a character is duplicated and the reading of the second character has voicing rend aku as in hito bi to people more often written with the iteration mark as but in rare cases the readings can be unrelated as in tobi han eru hop around more often written Because of the ambiguities involved kanji sometimes have their pronunciation for the given context spelled out in ruby characters known as fur i gana small kana written above or to the right of the character e g or kumi moji small kana written in line after the character This is especially true in texts for children or foreign learners It is also used in newspapers and manga for rare or unusual readings or for situations like the first time a character's name is given and for characters not included in the officially recognized set of essential kanji Works of fiction sometimes use fur iga nato create new words by giving normal kanji non standard readings or to attach a foreign word rendered in katakana as the reading for a kanji or kanji compound of the same or similar meaning Conversely specifying a given kanji or spelling out a kanji word whether the pronunciation is known or not can be complicated due to the fact that there is not a commonly used standard way to refer to individual kanji one does not refer to kanji 237 and that a given reading does not map to a single kanji indeed there are many homo ph ono us words not simply individual characters particularly for kango with on ' yomi It is easiest to write the word out either on paper or tracing it in the air or look it up given the pronunciation in a dictionary particularly an electronic dictionary when this is not possible such as when speaking over the phone or writing implements are not available and tracing in air is too complicated various techniques can be used These include giving kun ' yomi for characters these are often unique using a well known word with the same character and preferably the same pronunciation and meaning and describing the character via its components For example one may explain how to spell the word k shin ry spice via the words kao ri fragrance kara i spicy and in ry beverage the first two use the kun ' yomi the third is a well known compound saying kaori kara i ry as in in ry In dictionaries both words and individual characters have readings glossed via various conventions Native words and Sino Japanese vocabulary are glossed in hiragana for both kun and on readings while borrowing s gair a igo including modern borrowing s from Chinese are glossed in katakana this is the standard writing convention also used in fur i gana By contrast readings for individual characters are conventionally written in katakana for on readings and hiragana for kun readings Kun readings may further have a separator to indicate which characters are okur i gana and which are considered readings of the character itself For example in the entry for the reading corresponding to the basic verb eat taber u may be written as ta beru to indicate thatta is the reading of the character itself Further kanji dictionaries often list compounds including irregular readings of a kanji Since kanji are essentially Chinese hanzi used to write Japanese the majority of characters used in modern Japanese still retain their Chinese meaning physical resemblance with some of their modern traditional Chinese characters counterparts and a degree of similarity with Classical Chinese pronunciation imported to Japan from the 5 th to 9 th centuries 46 Nevertheless after centuries of development there is a notable number of kanji used in modern Japanese which have different meaning from hanzi used in modern Chinese Such differences are the result of Likewise the process of character simplification in mainland China since the 1950 s has resulted in the fact that Japanese speakers who have not studied Chinese may not recognize some simplified characters In addition to unique Japanese renditions of existing Chinese characters there also exist kanji that were invented in Japan these may be referred to as koku ji national characters or was ei kanji Japanese made kanji They are primarily formed by combining existing components in unique ways as is typical for Chinese characters The J y list contains about 9 koku ji of which the most commonly used is d work used in the fundamental verb hat arak u to work It is formed from the ' person ' radical plus movement Some koku ji including have entered the Chinese language The term koku ji may also refer to Chinese characters coined in other non Chinese countries the corresponding phenomenon in Korea is called guk j a Korean Hanja national characters there are however far fewer Korean coined characters than Japanese coined ones Other languages using the Chinese family of scripts sometimes have far more extensive systems of native characters most significantly Vietnamese ch N m which comprises over 20 000 characters used throughout traditional Vietnamese writing and Zhuang sawn dip which comprises over 10 000 characters which are still in use In addition to koku ji there are kanji that have been given meanings in Japanese that are different from their original Chinese meanings These are not considered koku ji but are instead called kok kun and include characters such as the following Han dynasty scholar Xu Shen in his 2 nd century dictionary Shu owen Jie zi classified Chinese characters into six categories Chinese li sh Japanese riku sho The traditional classification is still taught but is problematic and is no longer the focus of modern le xico graphic practice as some categories are not clearly defined nor are they mutually exclusive the first four refer to structural composition while the last two refer to usage 47 Sh kei Mandarin xi ng x ng characters are pictograph ic sketches of the object they represent For example is an eye while is a tree The current forms of the characters are very different from the originals though their representations are more clear in oracle bone script and seal script These pictograph ic characters make up only a small fraction of modern characters Shiji Mandarin zh sh characters are ideographs often called simple ideographs or simple indicatives to distinguish them and tell the difference from compound ideographs below They are usually simple graphically and represent an abstract concept such as up or above and down or below These make up a tiny fraction of modern characters Kai i Mandarin hu y characters are compound ideographs often called compound indicatives associative compounds or just ideographs These are usually a combination of pictographs that combine semantically to present an overall meaning An example of this type is rest from person radical and tree Another is the koku ji mountain pass made from mountain up and down These make up a tiny fraction of modern characters Keisei Mandarin x ng sh ng characters are ph ono semantic or radical phonetic compounds sometimes called semantic phonetic sem a sio phonetic or phonetic ideographic characters are by far the largest category making up about 90 of the characters in the standard lists however some of the most frequently used kanji belong to one of the three groups mentioned above so keisei moji will usually make up less than 90 of the characters in a text Typically they are made up of two components one of which most commonly but by no means always the left or top element suggests the general category of the meaning or semantic context and the other most commonly the right or bottom element approximates the pronunciation The pronunciation relates to the original Chinese and may now only be distantly detectable in the modern Japanese on ' yomi of the kanji it generally has no relation at all to kun ' yomi The same is true of the semantic context which may have changed over the centuries or in the transition from Chinese to Japanese As a result it is a common error in folk etymology to fail to recognize a ph ono semantic compound typically instead inventing a compound indicative explanation Ten ch Mandarin zhu n zh characters have variously been called derivative characters derivative cognates or translated as mutually explanatory or mutually synonymous characters this is the most problematic of the six categories as it is vaguely defined It may refer to kanji where the meaning or application has become extended For example is used for ' music ' and ' comfort ease ' with different pronunciations in Chinese reflected in the two different on ' yomi gaku music andr aku pleasure Kasha Mandarin ji ji are rebuses sometimes called phonetic loans The etymology of the characters follows one of the patterns above but the present day meaning is completely unrelated to this A character was appropriated to represent a similar sounding word For example in ancient Chinese was originally a pictograph for wheat Its syllable was homo ph ono us with the verb meaning to come and the character is used for that verb as a result without any embellishing meaning element attached The character for wheat originally meant to come being a keisei moji having ' foot ' at the bottom for its meaning part and wheat at the top for sound The two characters swapped meaning so today the more common word has the simpler character This borrowing of sounds has a very long history The iteration mark is used to indicate that the preceding kanji is to be repeated functioning similarly to a ditto mark in English It is pronounced as though the kanji were written twice in a row for example i roi ro various and toki doki sometimes This mark also appears in personal and place names as in the surname Sasaki This symbol is a simplified version of the kanji a variant of d same Another abbreviated symbol is in appearance a small katakana ke but actually a simplified version of the kanji a general counter It is pronounced ka when used to indicate quantity such as rok ka gets u six months org a if used as a genitive as in sekigahara Sekigahara The way how these symbols may be produced on a computer depends on the operating system In mac OS typing will reveal the symbol as well as and To produce type Under Windows typing will reveal some of these symbols while in Google IME may be used Kanji whose thousands of symbols defy ordering by conventions such as those used for the Latin script are often collated using the traditional Chinese radical and stroke sorting method In this system common components of characters are identified these are called radicals Characters are grouped by their primary radical then ordered by number of pen strokes within radicals For example the kanji character meaning cherry is sorted as a ten stroke character under the four stroke primary radical meaning tree When there is no obvious radical or more than one radical convention governs which is used for collation Other kanji sorting methods such as the SKIP system have been devised by various authors Modern general purpose Japanese dictionaries as opposed to specifically character dictionaries generally collate all entries including words written using kanji according to their kana representations reflecting the way they are pronounced The go j on ordering of kana is normally used for this purpose Japanese schoolchildren are expected to learn 1 026 basic kanji the ky i ku kanji before finishing the sixth grade The order in which these characters are learned is fixed The ky i ku kanji list is a subset of a larger list originally of 1 945 kanji and extended to 2 136 in 2010 known as the j y kanji required for the level of fluency necessary to read newspapers and literature in Japanese This larger list of characters is to be mastered by the end of the ninth grade 48 Schoolchildren learn the characters by repetition and radical Students studying Japanese as a foreign language are often required by a curriculum to acquire kanji without having first learned the vocabulary associated with them Strategies for these learners vary from copying based methods to mnemonic based methods such as those used in James He is ig's series Remembering the Kanji Other textbooks use methods based on the etymology of the characters such as Mathias and Ha be in's The Complete Guide to Everyday Kanji and Hens hall's A Guide to Remembering Japanese Characters Pictorial mnemonics as in the text Kanji Pic t o graph ix by Michael Rowley are also seen The Japan Kanji Aptitude Testing Foundation provides the Kanji kent ei Nihon kanji n ryo ku kent ei shi ken Test of Japanese Kanji Aptitude which tests the ability to
