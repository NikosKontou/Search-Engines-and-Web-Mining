adaptation of the manga's seventh part Steel Ball Run was announced in April 2025 Alive action film based on the fourth part Diamond Is Unbreakable was directed by Takashi Mi ike and released in Japan in August 2017 JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is well known for its art style and poses frequent references to Western popular music and fashion and battles centered around Stands psycho spiritual manifestations of the person's fighting spirit with unique supernatural abilities The series had over 120 million copies in circulation by August 2023 making it one of the best selling manga series in history and it has spawned a media franchise including one shot manga light novels and video games The manga TV anime and live action film are licensed in North America by Viz Media which has produced various English language releases of the series since 2005 The universe of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a reflection of the real world with the added existence of supernatural forces and beings 2 In this setting some people are capable of transforming their inner spiritual power into a Stand Su tando which are psycho spiritual manifestations of a person's fighting spirit another significant form of energy is Hamon Ripple a martial arts technique that allows its user to focus bodily energy into sunlight via controlled breathing The narrative of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is split into parts with independent stories and different characters Each of the series ' protagonists is a member of the Joe star family whose mainline descendants possess a star shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular JoJo a The first six parts take place within a single continuity whose generational conflict stems from the rivalry between Jonathan Joe star and Dio Brando while the latter three parts take place in a second continuity where the Joe star family tree is heavily altered For JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base before introducing modern elements As an example he often draws in a realistic style but uses surreal colors Araki aimed to draw real spirits in JoJo resulting in him going to the Kappa River in T no Iwate to get a better understanding of the concept 8 Araki was inspired by the art of the 1980 s shading techniques in Western art and classical paintings the manga coloring is based on calculations rather than consistency with Araki citing artists like Paul Gauguin as inspiration 9 6 He also claimed that mystery is the central theme of the manga as he was fascinated by the concept of it as a child Furthermore Araki wanted to explore superpowers and energy in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure resulting in various concepts such as Hamon and Stands 6 He said that the supernatural basis of the fights in his series evened the battlefield for women and children to match up against physically strong men 10 Much like Araki's previous work and Jojo's spiritual predecessor Bao h The Visitor the idea of an ultimate being was used in Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency in the forms of the vampires and the Pillar Men respectively 11 For Stardust Crusaders in particular Araki was influenced by role playing games in designing the characters ' skills 6 This part marked the transition from physical power to an emphasis on mental and spiritual power with Araki noting that the idea of Stands came from the idea of drawing the heart and soul 11 In creating the manga's generational story Araki thought much about death particularly the death of his grandfather and the legacy people leave behind in their lives for their descendants He also took inspiration from Roots The Saga of an American Family and East of Eden Araki focused on Roots for its family centric story 12 and he took the idea of intertwined destiny and rivalry between two families from East of Eden He thought highly of stories that were well received after changing protagonists which influenced Araki's decision to kill off Jonathan Joe star and write a generational story passing on his Spirit to his own descendants 13 None of the characters were modeled after anyone except Jo taro Kuj o who was based on Clint Eastwood Araki stated that he wanted to try a different type of main character for every part for example Part 1's Jonathan Joe star was a serious and honest person whereas Part 2's Joseph Joe star was a trickster 14 Although their personalities are different the two share a physical resemblance in order to have some continuity because it was unheard of in the 1980 s for a main character to die in a Weekly Sh nen Jump series 15 Araki's consistent focus on the Joe star family was intended to give a feeling of pride as well as wonder and mystery surrounding the lineage 14 Araki originally planned the series as a trilogy with the final confrontation taking place in present day Japan However Araki did not want Part 3 to be a tournament affair which was popular in Weekly Sh nen Jump at the time and therefore decided to make it a road movie inspired by Around the World in Eighty Days 16 With Part 4 Araki said that he moved away from muscle men as they fell out of popularity with readers and he wanted to focus more on fashion When designing his characters ' outfits Araki considers both everyday fashion and cartoonish bizarre clothing that would be impractical in real life 17 For Part 6 Araki wrote a female protagonist for the first time which he found complicated but also interesting due to the humanity she could possess 18 He later described Part 2's much earlier supporting character Lisa Lisa as fresh and unheard of in both manga and society in general for its time and said it was exciting to challenge people's expectations with the female warrior type 10 Having not specifically set out on creating a disabled character Araki explained that Part 7's paraplegic Johnny Joe star was a natural result of wanting to show a character who could grow both physically and mentally during a race where he would be forced not only to rely on other people but horses as well 17 Araki frequently uses unique onomatopoeia and poses in the series which he attributes to his love for heavy metal and horror films 19 The poses known in Japanese as JoJo dachi lit ' JoJo standing ' are considered iconic on his book covers and panels and were inspired by Araki's trip to Italy in his 20 s and his studies of Michelangelo's sculptures 20 Written and illustrated by Hiro hi ko Araki JoJo's Bizarre Adventure began serialization in the weekly sh nen manga anthology Weekly Sh nen Jump's combined issue 1 2 of 1987 published by Shueisha on January 1 1987 21 The series is divided into nine story arcs each following the adventures of a new protagonist

best selling manga for its debut week its second volume reached third place and its third reached second place 88 89 90 All three volumes were some of the best selling manga of 2012 91 92 All three volumes of Viz Media's release of Phantom Blood and all four volumes of Battle Tendency reached the top seven positions on The New York Times Manga Best Seller list 93 According to I Cv 2 JoJo's Bizarre Adventure was the eighth best selling manga franchise of the Q 4 2021 period September December in the United States 94 Reviewing the first volume IGN named JoJo's Bizarre Adventure a must read declaring the artwork of a standard virtually unseen in most manga produced today 95 Otaku USA's Joseph Luster called the series fun as hell and noted how the beginning is not filled with action like most Weekly Sh nen Jump series but instead has the tension of horror and thriller films 96 Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network wrote that the first volume combines a fighting story with a solid emotional background and will absolutely put hair on your chest She called Dio an excellent villain that the readers can enjoy hating but she criticized the anatomy of characters saying bodies are often twisted into impossible positions 97 Comics Gaming Magazine's Cole Watson also strongly praised Dio as the highlight character of Part 1 stating that his eyes were glued to the page whenever he appeared and described him as the literal embodiment of Satan in manga form Watson gave Phantom Blood a 7 5 out of 10 writing that while there is a lot to enjoy it primarily serves as Dio's origin story and there are some moments that are agonizingly slow 98 Silverman described Part 2 as less urgent than Part 1 which allows for more humor and insanity while still letting the reader get attached to the characters 99 She felt positively about how strikingly different the protagonist Joseph is from Part 1's Jonathan 100 However she wrote that Araki's art had gotten even more physically improbable making it difficult to distinguish body parts 100 When discussing his views on having characters die in a series writer Gen U rob uchi cited Battle Tendency's Caesar Zep pelias a character who became immortal thanks to his death 101 Reviewing Stardust Crusaders Silverman enjoyed seeing Part 2's Joseph team up with the new protagonist Jo taro Kuj o and was impressed that Araki was able to keep Dio out of Part 2 completely only to bring him back for Part 3 102 She initially called the replacement of Hamon with Stands both understandable and a bit of a disappointment since the insane physical abilities and contortions caused by the former were a large source of the fun in the first two parts 102 Silverman later described Stand battles as exciting and creative in subsequent reviews 103 104 Anime News Network had both Silverman and Faye Hopper review the first volume of Part 4 Silverman called the beginning slower and not as instantly engrossing as the previous parts but felt this allowed Jo suke whom she and Hopper both described as kinder than the previous protagonists to develop as a character Hopper stated that Diamond Is Unbreakable is sometimes criticized for a lack of a strong narrative through line in comparison to other parts but argued that this is one of its greatest strengths as it allows the main characters to simply be lending them an amiable humanity that none of the over the top archetypes in the first 3 Parts ever had 105 Both Screen Rant's Steven Blackburn and Jordan Richards of A IP T Comics called Golden Wind a breath of fresh air for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure by deviating from the basic formula and following Giorno son of villain Dio Brando as he looks to cement a reputation and build a criminal empire 106 107 Mary Lee Saud er of Anime News Network complimented the series ' alternating narratives and cited Part 5 as an example of how Araki avoids tropes commonly found in sh nen manga 108 Jenn i Lada of Silicon era also praised the protagonist Giorno and said the first volume of Part 5 shows how skilled Araki is at getting people quickly invested in a character and story She wrote that by giving readers a look at Giorno's past and insights into the person he became it emphasized why he was compelling We're introduced to his dream and see him take his first steps toward it 109 Despite calling the supporting cast a memorable bunch Richards felt they were underdeveloped as of the first volume but noted they had potential 107 Heidi Kemp s also of Otaku USA was mostly positive in her review of Rohan at the Louvre praising the art for being drawn in full color by hand although noted that readers new to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure might not fully understand the ending due to the one shot only briefly explaining the ability of Rohan's Stand Heaven's Door 110 For the 10 th anniversary of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006 Japanese fans voted JoJo's Bizarre Adventure second on a list of the Top 10 Manga of all time 111

had been launched against them from anonymous online Egyptian Islamic fundamentalists who noticed a scene in the Stardust Crusaders OVA in which Dio Brando reads a book depicting pages from the Quran while he orders a mercenary Hol Horse to kill the protagonists 2 118 According to Japan Today and Islamist Watch some Muslims feared this scene could spark a backlash not seen since the Jyllands Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy Sheikh Abdul Hamid At trash chairman of the Fatwa Committee at Al Azhar claimed that the scene depicted Muslims as terrorists and that Shueisha would be considered enemies of Islam 119 This recall affected the English language releases as well causing Viz Media and Shueisha to cease publication for a year Even though the manga did not feature that specific scene Shueisha had Araki redraw scenes that depicted characters fighting on top of and destroying mosques for later printings of the series 2 The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs addressed the issue in
