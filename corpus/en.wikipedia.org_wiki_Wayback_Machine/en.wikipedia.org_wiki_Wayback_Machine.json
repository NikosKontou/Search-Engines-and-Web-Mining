    "transformers_text": "The Way back Machine is a digital archive of the World Wide Web founded by the Internet Archive an American nonprofit organization based in San Francisco California Launched for public access in 2001 the service allows users to go back in time to see how websites looked in the past Founders Brewster Kahl e and Bruce Gilliat developed the Way back Machine to provide universal access to all knowledge by preserving archived copies of defunct web pages 1 The name is a reference to the fictional time traveling device of the same name from the animated cartoon The Bullwinkle Show from the 1960 s 2 3 4 In a segment of the cartoon entitled Peabody's Improbable History the characters Mister Peabody and Sherman use the Way back Machine to travel back in time to witness and participate in famous historical events 5 The Way back Machine's earliest archives go back at least to 1995 and by the end of 2009 more than 38 2 billion webpages had been saved As of October 2025 update the Way back Machine has archived more than 1 trillion web pages and well over 99 petabytes of data 6 7 The Internet Archive has been archiving cached web pages since at least 1995 One of the earliest known pages was archived on May 8 1995 8 Internet Archive founders Brewster Kahl e and Bruce Gilliat launched the Way back Machine in San Francisco California 9 in October 2001 10 11 primarily to address the problem of web content vanishing whenever it gets changed or when a website is shut down 12 The service enables users to see archived versions of web pages across time which the archive calls a three dimensional index 13 Kahl e and Gilliat created the machine hoping to archive the entire Internet and provide universal access to all knowledge 14 The name Way back Machine is a reference to a fictional time traveling device in the animated cartoon The Bullwinkle Show from the 1960 s 15 16 17 In a segment of the cartoon entitled Peabody's Improbable History the characters Mister Peabody and Sherman use the Way back Machine to travel back in time to witness and participate in famous historical events 18 From 1996 to 2001 the information was kept on digital tape with Kahl e occasionally allowing researchers and scientists to tap into the clunky database 19 When the archive reached its fifth anniversary in 2001 it was unveiled and opened to the public in a ceremony at the University of California Berkeley 20 By the time the Way back Machine launched it already contained over 10 billion archived pages 21 The data is stored on the Internet Archive's large cluster of Linux nodes 14 It revisits and archives new versions of websites on occasion see technical details below 22 Sites can also be captured manually by entering a website's URL into the search box provided that the website allows the Way back Machine to crawl it and save the data 6 On October 30 2020 the Way back Machine began fact checking content 23 As of January 2022 domains of ad servers are disabled from capturing 24 In May 2021 for Internet Archive's 25 th anniversary the Way back Machine introduced the Way forward Machine which allows users to travel to the Internet in 2046 where knowledge is under siege 25 26 On July 24 2025 Senator Alex Padilla designated the Internet Archive as a federal depository library 27 In 2025 Way back Machine reached 1 trillion webpages archived with a series of events being scheduled throughout October to celebrate it 28 The Way back Machine's software has been developed to crawl the Web and download all publicly accessible information and data files on webpages the Gopher hierarchy the Netnews Usenet bulletin board system and software 29 The information collected by these ' crawlers ' does not include all the content available on the Internet since much of the data is restricted by the publisher or stored in databases that are not accessible To overcome inconsistencies in partially cached websites Archive It org was developed in 2005 by the Internet Archive as a means of allowing institutions and content creators to voluntarily harvest and preserve collections of digital content and create digital archives 30 Crawls are contributed from various sources some imported from third parties and others generated internally by the Archive 22 For example content comes from crawls contributed by the Sloan Foundation and Alexa crawls run by the Internet Archive on behalf of NARA and the Internet Memory Foundation webpages archived by Archive Team 31 and mirrors of Common Crawl 22 The Worldwide Web Crawls have been running since 2010 and capture the global Web 22 32 In September 2020 the Internet Archive announced a partnership with Cloud flare an American content delivery network service provider to automatically index websites served via its Always Online services 33 Documents and resources are stored with time stamp URLs such as 20251205030237 Pages ' individual resources such as images style sheets and scripts as well as outgoing hyperlinks are linked to with the time stamp of the currently viewed page so they are redirected automatically to their individual captures that are the closest in time 34 The frequency of snapshot captures varies per website 22 Websites in the Worldwide Web Crawls are included in a crawl list with the site archived once per crawl 22 A crawl can take months or even years to complete depending on size 22 For example Wide Crawl Number 13 started on January 9 2015 and was completed on July 11 2016 35 However there may be multiple crawls ongoing at any one time and a site might be included in more than one crawl list so how often a site is crawled varies widely 22 A Save Page Now archiving feature was made available in October 2013 36 accessible on the lower right of the Way back Machine's main page 6 Once a target URL is entered and saved the web page will become part of the Way back Machine 36 Through the Internet address web archive org 6 users can upload to the Way back Machine a large variety of contents including PDF and data compression file formats The Way back Machine creates a permanent local URL of the upload content that is accessible in the web even if not listed while searching in the https archive org official website jargon Starting in October 2019 users were limited to 15 archival requests and retrievals per minute 37 As technology has developed over the years the storage capacity of the Way back Machine has grown In 2003 after only two years of public access the Way back Machine was growing at a rate of 12 terabytes per month The data is stored on Peta Box rack systems custom designed by Internet Archive staff The first 100 TB rack became fully operational in June 2004 although it soon became clear that they would need much more storage than that 38 39 The Internet Archive migrated its customized storage architecture to Sun Open Storage in 2009 and hosts a new data centre in a Sun Modular Datacenter on Sun Microsystems ' California campus 40 As of 2009 update the Way back Machine contained approximately three petabytes of data and was growing at a rate of 100 terabytes each month 41 A new improved version of the Way back Machine with an updated interface and a fresher index of archived content was made available for public testing in 2011 where captures appear in a calendar layout with circles whose width visualizes the number of crawls each day but no marking of duplicates with asterisks or an advanced search page 42 43 A top toolbar was added to facilitate navigating between captures A bar chart visualizes the frequency of captures per month over the years 44 Features like Changes Summary and a graphical site map were added subsequently In March that year it was said on the Way back Machine forum that the Beta of the new Way back Machine has a more complete and up to date index of all crawled materials into 2010 and will continue to be updated regularly The index driving the classic Way back Machine only has a little bit of material past 2008 and no further index updates are planned as it will be phased out this year 45 Also in 2011 the Internet Archive installed their sixth pair of Peta Box racks which increased the Way back Machine's storage capacity by 700 terabytes 46 In January 2013 Internet Archive announced a milestone of 240 billion URLs 47 In October 2013 Way back Machine introduced the Save a Page feature which allows any Internet user to archive the contents of a URL and quickly generates a permanent link unlike the preceding live web feature 48 49 In December 2014 the Way back Machine contained 435 billion web pages almost nine petabytes of data and was growing at about 20 terabytes a week 21 50 In July 2016 the Way back Machine reportedly contained around 15 petabytes of data 51 In October 2016 it was announced that the way web pages are counted would be changed resulting in the decrease of the archived pages counts shown Embedded objects such as pictures videos style sheets JavaScript s are no longer counted as a web page whereas HTML PDF and plain text documents remain counted 52 In September 2018 the Way back Machine contained over 25 petabytes of data 53 54 As of December 2020 the Way back Machine contained over 70 petabytes of data 55 The Way back Machine service offers three public APIs Save Page Now Availability and CD X 58 Save Page Now can be used to archive web pages Availability API for checking the archive availability status for a web page 59 checking whether an archive for the web page exists or not CD X API is for complex querying filtering and analysis of captured data 60 61 Historically the Way back Machine has respected the robots exclusion standard robots txt in determining if a website would be crawled or if already crawled if its archives would be publicly viewable Website owners had the option to opt out of Way back Machine through the use of robots txt It applied robots txt rules retroactively if a site blocked the Internet Archive any previously archived pages from the domain were immediately rendered unavailable as well In addition the Internet Archive stated that Sometimes a website owner will contact us directly and ask us to stop crawling or archiving a site We comply with these requests 62 In addition the website says The Internet Archive is not interested in preserving or offering access to Web sites or other internet documents of persons who do not want their materials in the collection 63 64 On April 17 2017 reports surfaced of sites that had gone defunct and became parked domains that were using robots txt to exclude themselves from search engines resulting in them being inadvertently excluded from the Way back Machine 65 Following this the Internet Archive changed the policy to require an explicit exclusion request to remove sites from the Way back Machine 34 Way back's retroactive exclusion policy is based in part upon Recommendations for Managing Removal Requests and Preserving Archival Integrity known as The Oakland Archive Policy published by the School of Information Management and Systems at University of California Berkeley in 2002 which gives a website owner the right to block access to the site's archives 66 Way back has complied with this policy to help avoid expensive litigation 67 The Way back retroactive exclusion policy began to relax in 2017 when it stopped honoring robots on U S government and military web sites for both crawling and displaying web pages As of April 2017 Way back is ignoring robots txt more broadly not just for U S government websites 68 69 70 71 From its public launch in 2001 the Way back Machine has been studied by scholars both for the ways it stores and collects data and for the actual pages contained in its archive As of 2013 scholars had written about 350 articles on the Way back Machine mostly from the information technology library science and social science fields Social science scholars have used the Way back Machine to analyze how the development of websites from the mid 1990 s to the present has affected the growth of companies 21 When the Way back Machine archives a page it usually includes most of the hyperlinks keeping those links active when they just as easily could have been broken by the Internet's instability Researchers in India studied the effectiveness of the Way back Machine's ability to save hyperlinks in online scholarly publications and found that it saved slightly more than half of them 72 Journalists use the Way back Machine to view dead websites dated news reports and changes to website contents Its content has been used to hold politicians accountable and expose battlefield lies 73 In 2014 an archived social media page of Igor Gir kin a separatist rebel leader in Ukraine showed him boasting about his troops having shot down a suspected Ukrainian military airplane before it became known that the plane actually was a civilian Malaysian Airlines jet Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 after which he deleted the post and blamed Ukraine's military for downing the plane 73 74 In 2017 the March for Science originated from a discussion on Reddit that indicated someone had visited Archive org and discovered that all references to climate change had been deleted from the White House website In response a user commented There needs to be a Scientists ' March on Washington 75 76 77 The site is used heavily for verification providing access to references and content creation by Wikipedia editors 78 When new URLs are added to Wikipedia the Internet Archive has been archiving them 78 In September 2020 a partnership was announced with Cloud flare to automatically archive websites served via its Always Online service which will also allow it to direct users to its copy of the site if it cannot reach the original host 33 In 2014 there was a six month lag time between when a website was crawled and when it became available for viewing in the Way back Machine 79 As of 2024 the lag time is 3 to 10 hours 34 The Way back Machine offers only limited search facilities Its Site Search feature allows users to find a site based on words describing the site rather than words found on the web pages themselves 80 The Way back Machine does not include every web page ever made due to the limitations of its web crawl er The Way back Machine cannot completely archive web pages that contain interactive features such as Flash platforms and forms written in JavaScript and progressive web applications because those functions require interaction with the host website This means that since approximately July 9 2013 the Way back Machine has been unable to display YouTube comments when saving videos ' watch pages as according to the Archive Team comments are no longer loaded within the page itself 81 The Way back Machine's web crawl er has difficulty extracting anything not coded in HTML or one of its variants which can often result in broken hyperlinks and missing images Due to this the web crawl er cannot archive orphan pages that are not linked to by other pages 80 82 The Way back Machine's crawl er only follows a predetermined number of hyperlinks based on a preset depth limit so it cannot archive every hyperlink on every page 32 In a 2009 case Net bul a LLC v Chord i ant Software Inc defendant Chord i ant filed a motion to compel Net bul a to disable the robots txt file on its website that was causing the Way back Machine to retroactively remove access to previous versions of pages it had archived from Net bul a's site pages that Chord i ant believed would support its case 83 Net bul a objected to the motion on the ground that defendants were asking to alter Net bul a's website and that they should have subpoenaed Internet Archive for the pages directly 84 An employee of Internet Archive filed a sworn statement supporting Chord i ant's motion however stating that it could not produce the web pages by any other means without considerable burden expense and disruption to its operations 83 Magistrate Judge Howard Lloyd in the Northern District of California San Jose Division rejected Net bul a's arguments and ordered them to disable the robots txt blockage temporarily in order to allow Chord i ant to retrieve the archived pages that they sought 83 In an October 2004 case Tele wiz j a Polska USA Inc v Echo star Satellite No 02 C 3293 65 Fed R Evi d Ser v 673 N D Ill October 15 2004 a litigant attempted to use the Way back Machine archives as a source of admissible evidence perhaps for the first time Tele wiz j a Polska is the provider of TV P Polonia and Echo Star operates the Dish Network Prior to the trial proceedings Echo Star indicated that it intended to offer Way back Machine snapshots as proof of the past content of Tele wiz j a Polska's website Tele wiz j a Polska brought a motion in li mine to suppress the snapshots on the grounds of hearsay and unauthenticated source but Magistrate Judge Ar lander Keys rejected Tele wiz j a Polska's assertion of hearsay and denied TV P's motion in li mine to exclude the evidence at trial 85 86 At the trial however District Court Judge Ronald Guzm an the trial judge overruled Magistrate Keys ' findings and held that neither the affidavit of the Internet Archive employee nor the underlying pages i e the Tele wiz j a Polska website were admissible as evidence Judge Guzm an reasoned that the employee's affidavit contained both hearsay and inconclusive supporting statements and the purported web page printouts were not self authenticating 87 88 The United States Patent and Trademark Office and the European Patent Office will accept date stamps from the Internet Archive as evidence of when a given Web page was accessible to the public These dates are used to determine if a Web page is available as prior art for instance in examining a patent application 89 There are technical limitations to archiving a website and as a consequence opposing parties in litigation can misuse the results provided by website archives This problem can be exacerbated by the practice of submitting screenshots of web pages in complaints answers or expert witness reports when the underlying links are not exposed and therefore can contain errors For example archives such as the Way back Machine do not fill out forms and therefore do not include the contents of non RESTful e commerce databases in their archives 90 In Europe the Way back Machine could be interpreted as violating copyright laws Only the content creator can decide where their content is published or duplicated so the Archive would have to delete pages from its system upon request of the creator 91 The exclusion policies for the Way back Machine may be found in the FAQ section of the site 92 Some cases have been brought against the Internet Archive specifically for its Way back Machine archiving efforts In late 2002 the Internet Archive removed various sites that were critical of Scientology from the Way back Machine 93 An error message stated that this was in response to a request by the site owner 94 Later it was clarified that lawyers from the Church of Scientology had demanded the removal and that the site owners did not want their material removed 95 In 2003 Harding Earley F oll mer Frail ey defended a client from a trademark dispute using the Archive's Way back Machine The attorneys were able to demonstrate that the claims made by the plaintiff were invalid based on the content of their website from several years prior The plaintiff Healthcare Advocates then amended their complaint to include the Internet Archive accusing the organization of copyright infringement as well as violations of the DMCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act Healthcare Advocates claimed that since they had installed a robots txt file on their website even if after the initial lawsuit was filed the Archive should have removed all previous copies of the plaintiff website from the Way back Machine however some material continued to be publicly visible on Way back 96 The lawsuit was settled out of court after Way back fixed the problem 97 Activist Suzanne Shell filed suit in December 2005 demanding Internet Archive pay her US 100 000 for archiving her website profane justice org between 1999 and 2004 98 99 Internet Archive filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on January 20 2006 seeking a judicial determination that Internet Archive did not violate Shell's copyright Shell responded and brought a counter suit against Internet Archive for archiving her site which she alleges is in violation of her terms of service 100 On February 13 2007 a judge for the United States District Court for the District of Colorado dismissed all counterclaims except breach of contract 99 The Internet Archive did not move to dismiss the copyright infringement claims that Shell asserted arose out of its copying activities which would also go forward 101 On April 25 2007 Internet Archive and Suzanne Shell jointly announced the settlement of their lawsuit 98 The Internet Archive said it has no interest in including materials in the Way back Machine of persons who do not wish to have their Web content archived We recognize that Ms Shell has a valid and enforceable copyright in her Web site and we regret that the inclusion of her Web site in the Way back Machine resulted in this litigation Shell said I respect the historical value of Internet Archive's goal I never intended to interfere with that goal nor cause it any harm 102 Between 2013 and 2016 Daniel Davy di uk a pornographic actor tried to remove archived images of himself from the Way back Machine's archive first by sending multiple DMCA requests to the archive and then by appealing to the Federal Court of Canada 103 104 105 The images were removed from the website in 2017 In 2018 archives of stalker ware application Flex iS py's website were removed from the Way back Machine The company claimed to have contacted the Internet Archive presumably to remove the archives of its website 106 Archive org is blocked in China 107 108 109 The Internet Archive was blocked in its entirety in Russia in 2015 16 ostensibly for hosting a Jihad outreach video 73 110 111 Since 2016 the website has been back available in its entirety although in 2016 Russian commercial lobbyists were suing the Internet Archive to ban it on copyright grounds 112 In March 2015 it was published that security researchers became aware of the threat posed by the service's unintentional hosting of malicious binaries from archived sites 113 114 Alison Mac rina director of the Library Freedom Project notes that while librarians deeply value individual privacy we also strongly oppose censorship 73 There is at least one case in which an article was removed from the archive shortly after it had been removed from its original website A Daily Beast reporter had written an article that outed several gay Olympian athletes in 2016 after the reporter had made a fake profile posing as a gay man on a dating app The Daily Beast removed the article after it was met with widespread furor not long after the Internet Archive soon did as well and stated that they did so for no other reason than to protect the safety of the outed athletes 73 Other threats include natural disasters 115 destruction both remote and physical 116 manipulation of the archive's contents problematic copyright laws 117 and surveillance of the site's users 118 Alexander Rose executive director of the Long Now Foundation suspects that in the long term of multiple generations next to nothing will survive in a useful way stating If we have continuity in our technological civilization I suspect a lot of the bare data will remain find able and searchable But I suspect almost nothing of the format in which it was delivered will be recognizable because sites with deep back ends of content management systems like D rupal and Ruby and Django are harder to archive 119 In 2016 in an article reflecting on the preservation of human knowledge The Atlantic has commented that the Internet Archive which describes itself to be built for the long term 120 is working furiously to capture data before it disappears without any long term infrastructure to speak of 121 In September 2024 the Internet Archive suffered a data breach that exposed 31 million records containing personal information including email addresses and hashed passwords 122 On October 9 2024 the site went down due to a distributed denial of service attack 123 124 On October 14 the site returned online but it remained in read only mode until November 4 during which time Save Page Now was disabled replaced with a Temporarily Unavailable banner 125 In November 2025 the Internet Archive displayed a temporarily offline message that directed people to social media for updates following a massive internet wide disruption involving Cloud flare on November 18 2025 126",
