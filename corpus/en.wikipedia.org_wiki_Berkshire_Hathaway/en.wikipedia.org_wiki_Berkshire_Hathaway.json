    "transformers_text": "Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( / ˈ b ɜːr k ʃ ər / ) is an American multinational conglomerate holding company headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska . Originally a textile manufacturer, the company transitioned into a conglomerate starting in 1965 under the management of chairman and CEO Warren Buffett and vice chairman Charlie Munger (from 1978 to 2023). Greg Abel now oversees most of the company's investments and has been named as Buffett's successor. Buffett personally owns 38.4% of the Class A voting shares of Berkshire Hathaway, representing a 15.1% overall economic interest in the company. [ 4 ]\n\nThe company is often compared to an investment fund ; between 1965, when Buffett gained control of the company, and 2023, the company's shareholder returns amounted to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.8% compared to a 10.2% CAGR for the S&P 500 . [ 5 ] However, in the 10 years ending in 2023, Berkshire Hathaway produced a CAGR of 11.8% for shareholders, compared to a 12.0% CAGR for the S&P 500 . [ 6 ] From 1965 to 2023, the stock price had negative performance in only eleven years. [ 7 ] In August 2024, Berkshire Hathaway became the eighth U.S. public company and the first non-technology company to be valued at over $1 trillion on the list of public corporations by market capitalization . [ 8 ]\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is ranked 5th on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue and 9th on the Fortune Global 500 . [ 9 ] Berkshire is one of the ten largest components of the S&P 500 [ 10 ] and is on the list of largest employers in the United States . Its class A shares have the highest per-share price of any public company in the world, reaching $700,000 in August 2024, because the board of directors has historically been opposed to stock splits . [ 11 ]\n\nBerkshire Hathaway originated as a textile manufacturer formed in 1955 from the merger of Hathaway Manufacturing Company and Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] After the merger, Berkshire Hathaway had 15 plants employing over 12,000 workers with over $120 million in revenue, and was headquartered in New Bedford . [ 16 ] However, seven of those locations were closed by the end of the 1950s, accompanied by large layoffs.\n\nIn 1962, Warren Buffett began buying Berkshire Hathaway stock for his investment fund , Buffett Partnership Ltd., at $7.50 per share, anticipating that as the company liquidated textile mills there would come a tender offer when he could sell the shares at a profit. A year later, Buffett's fund owned 7% of the company. [ 17 ] In 1964, Buffett offered to sell his shares back to the company for $11.50 each. [ 17 ] Seabury Stanton , the manager of Berkshire Hathaway, told Buffett orally that he had a deal. [ 17 ] A few weeks later, Warren Buffett received the tender offer in writing, but the tender offer was for only $11.375 per share. Buffett later admitted that this lower, undercutting offer made him angry. [ 18 ] Instead of selling at the slightly lower price, Buffett bought more of the stock at an even higher price to take control of the company and fire Stanton; Stanton and his son resigned in 1965. [ 19 ] However, this left Buffett's fund with a major interest in a declining textile business.\n\nBuffett has described buying the Berkshire Hathaway textile company as the biggest investment mistake he had ever made, denying him compounded investment returns of about $200 billion over the subsequent 45 years. [ 18 ] He has estimated that had he invested the same money directly in insurance businesses instead of indirectly via Berkshire Hathaway (due to what he perceived as a slight by an individual), it would have paid off several hundredfold. [ 20 ] In 1985, the company's last textile operations were shut down. [ 21 ]\n\nAlso in 1962, Warren Buffett set up his office in Omaha, Nebraska, at the current Berkshire Hathaway headquarters located at Blackstone Plaza (formerly named Kiewit Plaza). [ 22 ] [ 23 ] As of the end of 2024, the company had only 27 employees at that corporate headquarters. [ 24 ] In 1963, Franklin Otis Booth Jr. invested $1 million in the company (equivalent to $10,300,000 in 2024), and in 1968 David Gottesman also invested in the company. The investments eventually made both men billionaires. [ 25 ]\n\nIn March 1967, Berkshire acquired National Indemnity Company, based in Omaha, Nebraska , for $8.6 million in the first acquisition by the company under Buffett's control and the company's entrance into the insurance business. National Indemnity was founded in 1940 by Jack Dabney Ringwalt. [ 26 ] In 2012, National Indemnity acquired workers' compensation insurer GUARD for $221 million. [ 27 ]\n\nBerkshire acquired See's Candies in 1972 for $25 million. [ 28 ] It produces boxed chocolates and other confectionery products in two large kitchens in California. See's revenues are highly seasonal, with approximately 50% of total annual revenue earned in the months of November and December. [ 29 ] By 2019, the $25 million investment had returned over $2 billion, or an 8000% return, to Berkshire. [ 28 ]\n\nIn 1976, Berkshire first invested in GEICO , at a time when it was facing financial difficulty and had a very low stock price. [ 30 ]\n\nIn 1977, Berkshire bought the Buffalo Evening News and resumed publication of a Sunday edition of the paper that had ceased in 1914. After the morning newspaper Buffalo Courier-Express ceased operation in 1982, the Buffalo Evening News changed its name to The Buffalo News and began to print morning and evening editions. It now prints only a morning edition. [ 31 ] Berkshire formed BH Media Group with a purchase of the Omaha World-Herald in December 2011, [ 32 ] which included six other daily newspapers and several weeklies across Nebraska and southwest Iowa. [ 33 ] In June 2012, Berkshire bought 63 newspapers from Media General , including the Richmond Times-Dispatch and Winston-Salem Journal , for $142 million in cash. [ 34 ] In 2012, Berkshire Hathaway bought Texas dailies The Bryan-College Station Eagle and the Waco Tribune-Herald . [ 35 ] In 2013, the company bought the Tulsa World , the Greensboro, North Carolina -based News & Record , Virginia's Roanoke Times , and Press of Atlantic City . [ 36 ] In 2014, Graham Holdings Company sold its Miami television station, ABC affiliate WPLG to BH Media in a cash and stock deal. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] In June, 2018, Lee Enterprises and Berkshire Hathaway reached a five-year agreement to allow Lee Enterprises to manage Berkshire Hathaway's newspaper and digital operations. [ 39 ] In 2020, Lee Enterprises acquired BH Media Group's publications and The Buffalo News for $140 million in cash, retaining WPLG . [ 40 ] [ 41 ] In conjunction with the sale, Berkshire lent $576 million to Lee. [ 40 ]\n\nIn 1983, Berkshire acquired Nebraska Furniture Mart for $60 million. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] In 2000, Nebraska Furniture Mart bought Homemakers Furniture. [ 44 ]\n\nIn 1986, Berkshire acquired Scott Fetzer Company , a diversified group of 32 brands that manufactures and distributes products for residential, industrial, and institutional use, including Ginsu knives and World Book Encyclopedia . It included Kirby Company , which was sold in 2021, Wayne Water Systems, and Campbell Hausfeld products. [ 45 ] Campbell Hausfeld was transferred to Marmon, also a Berkshire subsidiary, in 2015.\n\nIn January 1986, Berkshire acquired Fechheimer Brothers, owner of Flying Cross, which manufactures public safety uniforms, and Vertx, a civilian tactical clothing company. [ 46 ]\n\nIn 1991, Berkshire acquired H.H. Brown Shoe Group . [ 47 ]\n\nIn May 1995, Berkshire acquired RC Willey Home Furnishings . [ 48 ] In June 1997, Berkshire acquired Star Furniture . [ 49 ]\n\nIn January 1996, Berkshire acquired full ownership of GEICO , acquiring the 49% of the company that it did not then own for $2.3 billion. [ 50 ] GEICO, headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland , primarily offers private passenger automobile insurance marketed directly to individual consumers in the United States. [ 51 ] The company is known for its advertising characters including a gecko and the GEICO Cavemen .\n\nIn February 1997, Berkshire acquired FlightSafety International (FSI), a pilot training company founded in 1951 by Albert Lee Ueltschi and headquartered at LaGuardia Airport in Flushing, New York . It uses flight simulators and is the largest provider of professional aviation training services. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ]\n\nIn October 1997, Berkshire acquired Dairy Queen , based in Edina, Minnesota, for $585 million. It franchises approximately 6,000 stores operating under the names Dairy Queen, Orange Julius , and Karmelkorn that sell dairy desserts, beverages, prepared foods, blended fruit drinks, popcorn, and other snack foods. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]\n\nIn July 1998, Berkshire Hathaway acquired NetJets , formerly Executive Jet Aviation, for $725 million in cash. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] NetJets is the world's largest provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft. In 1986, NetJets created the fractional ownership of aircraft concept and introduced its NetJets program in the United States with one aircraft type. In 2019, the NetJets program operated more than 10 aircraft types with a fleet size of greater than 750. [ 60 ]\n\nIn December 1998, Berkshire acquired Gen Re , headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut , for $22 billion. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Berkshire paid for the acquisition with Class A shares valued at $58,400 each; Buffett later said he overpaid, despite strong performance by General Re. [ 63 ]\n\nIn 1999, Berkshire acquired MidAmerican Energy Holdings. At the time of purchase, Berkshire's voting interest was limited to 10% of the company's shares, but this restriction ended when the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was repealed in 2005. It owns Northern Powergrid , which operates in the UK. [ 64 ] In 2005, it acquired PacifiCorp for $5.1 billion in cash, and assumed $4.3 billion in PacificCorp debt and preferred stock. [ 65 ] MidAmerican was rebranded as Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE) in April 2014. [ 66 ] The division owns a residential real estate brokerage business, which, in March 2013, was rebranded as HomeServices of America , a division of Berkshire Hathaway Energy . [ 67 ] In addition to brokerage services, it provides mortgage loan originations, title insurance and closing services, home warranty , property insurance and casualty insurance and other related services. The company has acquired several residential real estate brokerages including Long & Foster , acquired in September 2017. [ 68 ]\n\nIn October 1999, Berkshire acquired Jordan's Furniture for an estimated $200 million to $300 million. [ 69 ]\n\nCORT Business Services Corporation was acquired in February 2000 by Wesco Financial Corporation, an 80.1% owned subsidiary of Berkshire and is the largest U.S. provider of rental furniture, accessories and related services in the \"rent-to-rent\" segment of the furniture rental industry. [ 70 ]\n\nIn May 2000, Berkshire acquired Ben Bridge Jeweler , a chain of jewelry stores established in 1912 with locations primarily in the western United States. [ 71 ] Helzberg Diamonds , a chain of jewelry stores based in Kansas City that began in 1915, was acquired by Berkshire in 1995 after a chance run in between Buffett and Barnett Helzberg on a street in New York City. [ 72 ]\n\nIn June 2000, the company acquired Justin Brands, the parent company of Justin Boots , Acme Boots , and Acme Brick for $600 million in cash.

Products are produced in the United States and Europe and are sold primarily through a global network of independent dealers and distributors, with peak sales occurring in the second and third quarters.\n\nIn May 2003, Berkshire acquired McLane Company from Walmart . [ 89 ] The company later acquired Professional Datasolutions and Salado Sales.

[ 110 ] [ 111 ]\n\nIn January 2016, Berkshire Hathaway acquired Precision Castparts Corp. for $32.1 billion. [ 112 ] In 2020, Buffett said he overpaid for the company and wrote down its value by approximately $10 billion. [ 113 ]\n\nIn February 2016, Berkshire Hathaway acquired Duracell from Procter & Gamble for $4.7 billion in stock in P&G previously owned by Berkshire Hathaway. [ 114 ] [ 115 ]\n\nIn 2017, Berkshire acquired 38.6% of truck stop chain Pilot Flying J for $2.8 billion, followed by the acquisition of an additional 41.4% of the company for $8.2 billion in 2023, and the remaining 20% in 2024 for $3 billion. It appointed two Berkshire Hathaway Energy executives as CEO and CFO of the company, retaining Jimmy Haslam as chairman. [ 116 ]\n\nIn October 2022, Berkshire Hathaway acquired insurance company Alleghany Corporation for $11.6 billion. [ 117 ] As part of the transaction, Berkshire reduced the purchase price of the company by any fees that it paid investment bankers. This move was touted as an example of Warren Buffett's \"disdain\" for investment bankers. [ 118 ]\n\nIn October 2025, Berkshire acquired OxyChem, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum , in a $9.7 billion cash deal. [ 119 ]\n\nBuffett began investing in Wells Fargo in 1989; however, by the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire Hathaway had sold its entire interest in the company. [ 120 ] [ 121 ]\n\nBuffett turned down an opportunity to invest in Amazon.com in 1994, as he was unable to predict the company's future growth and it was losing money. [ 122 ] Berkshire Hathaway bought shares in Amazon in 2019, a position worth $2 billion at the time. [ 123 ]\n\nBerkshire made its first investment in Tesco in 2006, and in 2012 it raised this stake to over 5% of the company, investing a total of $2.3 billion. [ 124 ] Buffett sold around 30% of this stake in 2013 when he \"soured somewhat on the company's then-management\", realizing a profit of $43 million. [ 125 ] As Tesco's problems mounted through 2014, Berkshire sold all the remaining shares with Buffett saying to shareholders that the delay in selling shares was costly. Berkshire realized an after-tax loss of $444 million on the Tesco investment. [ 125 ]\n\nIn early 2008, Berkshire increased its stake in ConocoPhillips to 85 million shares. [ 126 ] Buffett later described this as \"a major mistake\" as the price of oil collapsed during the Great Recession . Berkshire sold most of its shares but held 472,000 shares until 2012. That year, ConocoPhillips completed the corporate spin-off of Phillips 66 , of which Berkshire owned 27 million shares. Berkshire later sold $1.4 billion worth of shares to Phillips 66 in exchange for Phillips Specialty Products. [ 127 ] Buffett frequently referred to Phillips 66 as one of the best businesses Berkshire invested in because of its consistent dividends and share repurchase programs. However, Berkshire sold its entire holdings in 2020. [ 128 ] [ 129 ]\n\nIn September 2008, at the peak of the 2008 financial crisis , Berkshire invested $5 billion in preferred stock in Goldman Sachs to provide it with a source of funding when capital markets had become constrained. The preferred stock yielded an annual interest rate of 10%, earning Berkshire $500 million in interest income per year. Berkshire also received warrants to buy 43.5 million shares with at $115 per share, which were exercisable at any time for a five-year term. [ 130 ] [ 131 ] Goldman had the right to re-purchase the preferred stock at a 10% premium, and in March 2011 exercised this right paying $5.5 billion to Berkshire. Profit on the preferred stock was estimated at $1.8 billion [ 132 ] and exercising the warrants yielded a profit of more than $2 billion. [ 133 ] Buffett defended Lloyd Blankfein 's decisions as CEO of Goldman Sachs and his efforts to improve the reputation of the company during the 2008 financial crisis . [ 134 ] [ 135 ] [ 136 ]\n\nIn September 2008, BHE invested about US$230 million for approximately a 10% share of BYD Auto . [ 137 ] Some shares were sold in 2023 and 2024, with Buffett motivated by the China–United States trade war . [ 138 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ]\n\nIn October 2008, Berkshire invested $6.5 billion in Wrigley Company as part of a financing package to enable Mars Inc. to acquire the company. Berkshire sold its remaining bonds and preferred stock to Mars in 2016. [ 141 ]\n\nIn early 2011, Berkshire first invested in IBM . The shares were entirely sold in 2018. [ 142 ] [ 143 ]\n\nOn August 26, 2011, Berkshire Hathaway bought $5 billion of preferred shares in Bank of America . [ 144 ] The shares yielded 6%, earning Berkshire $300 million in annual interest. Alongside the preferred stock investment, Berkshire obtained warrants allowing Berkshire to buy 700 million common shares at $7.14 per share, which were exercised. By 2017, this position had yielded a profit of about $12 billion excluding the annual interest earned from the preferred stock. [ 145 ]\n\nIn 2013, Berkshire and 3G Capital acquired H. J. Heinz Company for $28 billion including debt. [ 146 ] In 2015, Heinz merged with Kraft Foods to form Kraft Heinz . [ 147 ] In 2019, Buffett said that he overpaid in the deal. [ 148 ]\n\nIn 2013, Berkshire owned 1.74 million shares of Gannett ; however, it sold its shares in the second quarter of 2013. [ 149 ] [ 150 ]\n\nIn the first quarter of 2016, Berkshire began investing in Apple Inc. , with a purchase of 9.8 million shares (0.2% of Apple) worth $1 billion. By the end of June 2016, this stake had increased to 15.2 million shares (0.3% of Apple). By December 31, 2016, Berkshire had built up a stake of 57.4 million shares (1.1% of Apple) with an estimated average acquisition price of $110 per share (before the 2020 4:1 split). Aggressive stock purchases continued and by March 31, 2017, Berkshire had amassed a stake of 129 million shares (2.5% of Apple). By December 31, 2017, Berkshire owned 166 million shares (3.3% of Apple). Berkshire bought 75 million more shares in early 2018. [ 151 ] [ 152 ] As of December 31, 2022, [update] Berkshire owned 5.8% of Apple. [ 153 ] [ 154 ] Berkshire Hathaway reduced its Apple stake by nearly 50%, selling $75.5 billion worth of stock in the second quarter of 2024, increasing its cash reserves to a record $276.9 billion. [ 155 ] Buffett had said that Apple has developed an ecosystem and level of brand loyalty that provides it with an economic moat , and that consumers appear to have a degree of price insensitivity when it comes to the iPhone . While Buffett generally does not invest in tech stocks, he has said that Apple is a consumer products company and that he understands consumer products businesses. [ 156 ]\n\nIn the third quarter of 2016, Berkshire surprised investors by making large equity investments in the major US airlines . Buffett had previously described airlines as a \"deathtrap for investors\". Buffett had made an investment in US Airways in 1989 which, although he sold for a profit, almost lost Berkshire a substantial sum of money. [ 157 ] In 2017, Berkshire was the largest shareholder in United Airlines and Delta Air Lines and a top 3 shareholder in Southwest Airlines and American Airlines . Buffett himself has described this as a \"call on the industry\" rather than a choice in an individual company. American Airlines' CEO Doug Parker is said to have won over Ted Weschler in arguing that the airline industry had consolidated sufficiently and rationalized supply such that longer-term profitability could be achieved in an industry that has historically been loss-making in aggregate. [ 158 ] In April 2020, Berkshire sold all shares in the airlines due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial air transport . [ 159 ]\n\nIn June 2017, Berkshire invested $377 million in Store Capital, a Scottsdale-based real estate investment trust that owned more than 1,750 properties in 48 states; the company was sold to private equity firms in 2022. [ 160 ] [ 161 ] [ 162 ]\n\nIn June 2017, Berkshire acquired a 38.4% stake in Home Capital Group for $400 million, giving a lifeline to the Toronto -based embattled mortgage lender. [ 163 ] [ 164 ] The shares were sold in 2018. [ 165 ]\n\nIn 2019, by buying warrants and preferred stock, Berkshire provided $10 billion in financing to Occidental Petroleum as part of its acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum . Berkshire began investing in common shares of Occidental beginning in 2022 and has increased its position since. [ 166 ] [ 167 ]\n\nBetween September 2019 and August 2020, Berkshire bought more than 5% of the outstanding stock of each of the five largest Japanese sogo shosha ( Itochu , Mitsubishi , Mitsui , Sumitomo , and Marubeni ) through its National Indemnity subsidiary. These stakes were worth a total of over $6 billion as of August 2020. By April 2023, Berkshire increased its stake in each of those companies to 7.4%. [ 168 ] He continued to increase the stakes over time. [ 169 ]\n\nIn the second quarter of 2020, Berkshire added a position of more than 20 million shares in Barrick Gold ; the shares were sold in 2021. [ 170 ] In the third quarter of 2020, the company agreed to buy Dominion Energy's natural gas transmission and storage operations. [ 171 ]\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire acquired a $2.6 billion stake in Paramount Global . [ 172 ] However, at an annual meeting on May 4, 2024, Buffett stated that he had sold all of his shares in Paramount at a substantial loss, blaming himself for deciding to invest. [ 173 ]\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire acquired 121 million shares of HP Inc. valued at more than $4.2 billion; the shares were sold in 2023 and 2024. [ 174 ]\n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, Berkshire bought 60 million shares in TSMC valued at $4.1 billion; the shares were sold in late 2022 and 2023 in part due to geopolitical tensions. [ 175 ] [ 154 ] [ 176 ]\n\nBerkshire began investing in Chubb Limited in 2023; by 2024, it owned a 6.4% stake worth $6.7 billion. [ 177 ]\n\nBerkshire Hathaway bought 5.62 million shares of Constellation Brands in the fourth quarter of 2024, worth $1.24 billion. The purchase made Berkshire Hathaway the sixth-largest shareholder of Constellation Brands.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway sold its stake in Ulta Beauty in the fourth quarter of 2024, just two quarters after acquiring the shares. [ 178 ]\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Berkshire Hathaway liquidated all of its ETF holdings in the S&P 500, worth a total of $44 million. [ 179 ]\n\nAside from its subsidiaries, Berkshire manages a portfolio of non-controlling stock investments into which its insurance companies invest policy premiums. These holdings are broadly disclosed in its Form 13F filings, although the company sometimes obtains permission to keep active trades confidential. [ 180 ]\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, the company had $344 billion in Treasury bills, which together with its reported cash of $44 billion made up the largest cash position of any U.S.-based public company . [ 181 ]\n\nInsurance is a major area of operations and the retained premiums (float) serve as an important source of capital. [ 182 ] Buffett has said that he prefers to invest in evergreen businesses that generate predictable long-term returns, [ 183 ] that he doesn't invest in companies that he doesn't understand, [ 184 ] and that he does not like to invest in companies that may undergo significant change. [ 185 ] The company has generally avoided investing in high-tech firms, missing early opportunities to invest in Microsoft and Amazon.com despite having relationships with the founders of those companies. With some exceptions, the company also usually does not invest in real property due to precise pricing, lack of competitive advantage, complex management, and corporation tax disadvantages. [ 186 ]\n\nBerkshire Hathaway has never undergone a stock split of its Class A shares because of management's desire to attract long-term investors as opposed to short-term speculation . [ 187 ] However, in 1996, Berkshire Hathaway created Class B shares , with a per-share value of 1 ⁄ 30 of that of the original shares (now Class A) and 1 ⁄ 200 of the per-share voting rights, and after the January 2010 split, at 1 ⁄ 1,500 the price and 1 ⁄ 10,000 the voting rights of the Class-A shares. Holders of class A stock are allowed to convert their stock to Class B, though not vice versa. Buffett was reluctant to create the class B shares but did so to thwart the creation of unit investment trusts that would have marketed themselves as Berkshire look-alikes. [ 188 ]\n\nIn January 2010, as part of the acquisition of BNSF Railway , Berkshire completed a 50-to-1 stock split of its class B shares . The increased market liquidity resulted in the company's inclusion in the S&P 500 . [ 189 ] [ 190 ]\n\nShares closed over $1,000 for the first time on August 26, 1983, and over $10,000 on October 16, 1992. [ 191 ] Shares closed over $100,000 for the first time on October 23, 2006. [ 192 ] They first closed over $200,000 on August 14, 2014. [ 191 ] Shares closed over $500,000 for the first time on March 16, 2022. [ 193 ]\n\nThe salary for Buffett is $100,000 per year with no stock options, [ 4 ] which is among the lowest salaries [ 194 ] for CEOs of large companies in the United States. [ 195 ] Buffett's salary has not changed in 35 years. [ 4 ] Buffett also receives approximately $300,000 worth of home security services from the company annually. [ 4 ]\n\nAbel and Jain each receive a salary of $20 million per year, with a possible $3 million annual bonus at the discretion of Buffett. [ 4 ]\n\nBuffett's letters to shareholders are published annually.\n\nBerkshire's annual shareholders' meetings, nicknamed \" Woodstock for Capitalists\", take place at the CHI Health Center Omaha in Omaha, Nebraska. Attendance generally totals over 40,000 people and the meetings last for 6 to 8 hours, with Buffett himself, as well as Abel and Jain, answering questions from shareholders. [ 196 ] [ 197 ]\n\nKnown for their humor and light-heartedness, the meetings typically start with a cartoon made for Berkshire shareholders.\n\nCurrent members of the board of directors of Berkshire Hathaway are Warren Buffett (chairman), Greg Abel (vice chairman of non-insurance business operations), Ajit Jain (vice chairman of insurance operations), Chris Davis, Susan Alice Buffett (Buffett's daughter), Howard Graham Buffett (Buffett's son), Ronald Olson , Kenneth Chenault , Steve Burke , Susan Decker , Meryl Witmer, Charlotte Guyman, Esteban Rodriguez Jr. [ 3 ]\n\nCharlie Munger served as vice chairman of the company from 1978 until his death on November 28, 2023. [ 207 ]\n\nDavid L. Sokol , CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy until early 2008, [ 208 ] was a top lieutenant for Buffett. Sokol, who was paid $24 million per year, resigned from Berkshire in 2011 after it was disclosed that he personally made a $3 million profit from Berkshire Hathaway's purchase of Lubrizol . [ 209 ]\n\nIn October 2010, Berkshire announced that 39-year old Todd Combs , manager of the hedge fund Castle Point Capital, would join as an investment manager . [ 210 ] [ 211 ] [ 212 ] [ 213 ]\n\nIn early 2012, 50-year-old Ted Weschler , founder of Peninsula Capital Advisors, joined Berkshire as a second investment manager. [ 214 ] [ 215 ]\n\nIn January 2018, Berkshire Hathaway appointed Ajit Jain and Greg Abel to vice-chairman roles. Abel was appointed vice chairman for non-insurance business operations, and Jain became vice chairman of insurance operations. [ 216 ] [ 217 ]\n\nIn May 2021, Buffett named Greg Abel to be his successor as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. [ 218 ]\n\nIn May 2025, Buffett announced his intention to retire as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the annual shareholders' meeting, with Greg Abel succeeding him at the end of 2025. [ 219 ]\n\nIn 2007, the company was named by Barron's as the most respected company in the world based on a survey of American money managers. [ 221 ] It was named second after Apple Inc. on the same survey in 2014 [ 222 ] and 2015 [ 223 ] and was second behind Johnson & Johnson in 2016. [ 224 ]\n\nIn July 2022, Trident Mortgage Company, a subsidiary of HomeServices of America (owned by Berkshire Hathaway), agreed to a $20 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over allegations of redlining in the Philadelphia area. Federal investigators found that Trident failed to provide equal access to mortgage credit in neighborhoods with large Black and Latino populations. [ 225 ] [ better source needed ]\n\nIn January 2025, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed a lawsuit against Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary, alleging the company steered borrowers into unaffordable loans. The complaint described aggressive lending practices that resulted in financial hardship, late fees, and in some cases, home loss or bankruptcy. [ 226 ] [ better source needed ]\n\nA 2025 Reuters investigation reported that Berkshire Hathaway Energy continues to operate several of the most polluting coal-fired power plants in the United States. Despite investments in renewable energy, the company was criticized for its decision to operate these plants until at least 2049, raising public health and environmental concerns. [ 227 ]",
