    "transformers_text": "GameSpot is an American video gaming website that provides news, reviews, previews, downloads, and other information on video games. The site was launched on May 1, 1996, created by Pete Deemer, Vince Broady, and Jon Epstein. In addition to the information produced by GameSpot staff, the site also allows users to write their own reviews, blogs, and post on the site's forums. It has been owned by Fandom, Inc. since October 2022. [ 2 ]\n\nIn 2004, GameSpot won \"Best Gaming Website\" as chosen by the viewers in Spike TV 's second Video Game Award Show , [ 3 ] and has won Webby Awards several times. The domain GameSpot.com attracted at least 60 million visitors annually by October 2008 according to a Compete.com study. [ 4 ]\n\nIn January 1996, Pete Deemer, Vince Broady, and Jon Epstein quit their positions at IDG and founded SpotMedia Communications. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] SpotMedia then launched GameSpot on May 1, 1996. [ 7 ] Originally, GameSpot focused solely on personal computer games, so a sister site, VideoGameSpot , was launched on December 1, 1996. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Eventually VideoGameSpot , then renamed VideoGames.com , was merged into GameSpot . [ 8 ]\n\nOn January 6, 1997, SpotMedia and publisher Ziff Davis announced a $20 million agreement allowing the publisher to run content from Computer Gaming World and Electronic Gaming Monthly on SpotMedia's websites. [ 9 ] By the following month, Ziff Davis's substantial financial infusion enabled GameSpot to grow to 45 employees. [ 7 ] Upon the May 11, 1998 launch of Ziff Davis's cable channel ZDTV , a program by GameSpot was projected for a mid-summer release, [ 10 ] and would premiere as GameSpot TV on July 4. [ 11 ] In February 1999, PC Magazine named GameSpot one of the hundred best websites, alongside competitors IGN and CNET Gamecenter . [ 12 ]\n\nOn July 19, 2000, CNET announced its acquisition of ZDNET , putting GameSpot and Gamecenter under the same parent company. [ 13 ] That December, The New York Times declared GameSpot and Gamecenter the \" Time and Newsweek of gaming sites\". [ 14 ] In February 2001, GameSpot was spared from a redundancy reduction effort by CNET which shuttered Gamecenter . [ 15 ] [ 16 ]\n\nIn October 2005, GameSpot adopted a new design similar to that of TV.com , now considered a sister site to GameSpot . [ 17 ] GameSpot ran a few different paid subscriptions from 2006 to 2013, but is no longer running those. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] In June 2008, GameSpot ' s parent company CNET was acquired by CBS Corporation , and GameSpot along with CNET's other online assets were managed by the CBS Interactive division. [ 21 ]\n\nA new layout change was adopted in October 2013. [ citation needed ]\n\nCNET was sold to Red Ventures in October 2020. [ 22 ] Two years later, Fandom acquired GameSpot , along with Metacritic , TV Guide , GameFAQs , Giant Bomb , Cord Cutters News, and Comic Vine from Red Ventures. [ 2 ] [ 23 ] In January 2023, 40-50 employees were affected by a round of layoffs. [ 24 ] More layoffs at GameSpot took place in January 2024. [ 25 ]\n\nGameSpot UK (United Kingdom) was started in October 1997 and operated until mid-2002, offering content that was oriented for the British market that often differed from that of the U.S. site. During this period, GameSpot UK won the 1999 PPAi (Periodical Publishers Association interactive) award for best website, [ 26 ] and was short listed in 2001. [ 27 ] PC Gaming World was considered a \"sister print magazine\" and some content appeared on both GameSpot UK and PC Gaming World . [ 28 ] Following the purchase of ZDNet by CNET , GameSpot UK was merged with the main US site. On April 24, 2006, GameSpot UK was relaunched. [ 29 ]\n\nIn a similar fashion, GameSpot AU (Australia) existed on a local scale in the late 1990s with Australian-produced reviews. It ceased in 2003. When a local version of the main CNET portal, CNET.com.au was launched in 2003, GameSpot AU content was folded into CNET.com.au. The site was fully re-launched in mid-2006, with a specialized forum, local reviews, special features, local pricings in Australian dollars , Australian release dates, and more local news. [ citation needed ]\n\nJeff Gerstmann , editorial director of the site, was fired on November 28, 2007, as a result of pressure from Eidos Interactive, a major advertiser; Eidos objected to the 6/10 review that Gerstmann had given Kane & Lynch: Dead Men , a game they were heavily advertising on GameSpot at the time. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Both GameSpot and parent company CNET initially stated that his dismissal was unrelated to the review. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] However, in March 2012, the non-disclosure agreement that forced Gerstmann to withhold the details of his termination was nullified. Not long after, Giant Bomb (a site Gerstmann founded after leaving GameSpot ) was being purchased by the same parent company as GameSpot , and that they moved their headquarters into the same building. As part of this announcement, Gerstmann revealed that the firing was indeed related to threats of Eidos pulling advertising revenue away from GameSpot as a result of Gerstmann's poor review score, which was confirmed by GameSpot's Jon Davison.
