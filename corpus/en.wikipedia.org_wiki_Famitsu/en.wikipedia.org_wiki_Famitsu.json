    "transformers_text": "Famitsu [ a ] , formerly Famicom Tsūshin [ b ] , is a line of Japanese video game magazines published by Kadokawa Game Linkage (previously known as Gzbrain), a subsidiary of Kadokawa . Famitsu is published in weekly and monthly formats, and in special issues devoted to particular themes. It was first published in 1986.\n\nShūkan Famitsū , [ c ] the original publication, is considered the most widely read and respected video game news magazine in Japan. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] From October 28, 2011, the company began releasing the digital version on BookWalker weekly. [ 5 ] [ 6 ]\n\nThe name Famitsu is a portmanteau abbreviation of Famicom Tsūshin ; Famicom is an abbreviation of Family Computer , the dominant video game console in Japan when the magazine was first published.\n\nLOGiN ( ログイン ) , a computer game magazine, started in 1982 as an extra issue of ASCII , and later it became a periodic magazine. Famicom Tsūshin [ d ] was a column in Login , focused on the Famicom platform, and ran from March 1985 to December 1986 issue. It received a good reception, so the publisher decided to found the magazine specialized for it. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]\n\nThe first issue of Famitsu was published on June 6, 1986, as Famicom Tsūshin . [ 9 ] It sold less than 200,000 copies, despite 700,000 copies printed. The major competitor was Family Computer Magazine launched in July 1985 by Tokuma Shoten . Famitsu ' s editor found many readers had multiple game consoles, and they thought it would be better if the magazine covered various platforms. Increasing contents and the page count gradually, the magazine was published three times per month instead of semimonthly publication. On July 19, 1991 (issue #136) the magazine was renamed to Shūkan Famicom Tsūshin [ e ] and issues were published weekly thereafter. Alongside the weekly magazine, a monthly version called Gekkan Famicom Tsūshin [ f ] was also published.\n\nHirokazu Hamamura , an editor-in-chief (1992–2002), felt the beginning of a new era when he saw a private demonstration of Final Fantasy VI in 1993. He thought the name Famicom Tsūshin should be refurbished. At the start of 1996 (with issue #369) the magazines underwent another name change, truncating their titles to Shūkan Famitsū [ g ] and Gekkan Famitsū [ h ] . The name Famitsu had already been in common use. [ 8 ]\n\nThe magazine was published by ASCII from its founding through March 2000 when it was sold to Enterbrain , which published it for 13 years, until their parent company Kadokawa published it from 2013 to 2017. Since 2017, Kadokawa's subsidiary Gzbrain has been publishing the magazine, while in 2019 the company changed its name to Kadokawa Game Linkage. [ 6 ]\n\nFamicom Tsūshin initially focused on the Famicom platform, but later it featured multi-platform coverage. Famicom Tsūshin was renamed to Famitsu in 1995. Shūkan Famitsū is a weekly publication concentrating on video game news and reviews, and is published every Thursday with a circulation of 500,000 per issue. [ 1 ] Gekkan Famitsū is published monthly.\n\nFamitsu covers alternately feature pop idols or actresses on even-numbered issues and the Famitsu mascot, Necky [ i ] the Fox [ 10 ] in odd-numbered issues. [ 11 ] Year-end and special editions all feature Necky dressed as popular contemporary video game characters. Necky is the cartoon creation of artist Susumu Matsushita , and he takes the form of a costumed fox. [ 12 ] The costumes worn by Necky reflect current popular video games. Necky's name was chosen according to a reader poll, and it derives from a complex Japanese pun: \"Necky\" is actually the reverse of the Japanese word for fox, キツネ, [ j ] and his original connection to Fami com Tsūshin is intended to evoke the bark of the fox, the Japanese onomatopoeia of which is コンコン [ k ] . [ 13 ] Necky makes a cameo appearance in Super Mario Maker . [ 14 ]\n\nFamitsu publishes other magazines dedicated to particular consoles. Currently in circulation are:\n\nFamitsu spin-offs that are no longer in circulation include:\n\nVideo games are graded in Famitsu via a review system of having four critics each assign the game a score from 0 to 10, with 10 being the highest score. The scores are then added together. As of 2024 [update] , thirty games have received perfect scores of 40 from Famitsu . The console with the highest number of perfect-scoring games is the PlayStation 3 , with seven total. Four of the perfect-scoring games on PlayStation 3 were also released on the Xbox 360 , which is tied with the Wii for the second-highest number of perfect scores at five total. Franchises with multiple perfect score winners include The Legend of Zelda with five titles, Metal Gear with three titles, and Final Fantasy with two titles. The most recent game to receive a perfect score is Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth . [ 15 ]\n\nAs of 2023 [update] , all but three games with perfect scores are from Japanese companies, ten being published/developed by Nintendo , four by Square Enix , three by Sega , three by Konami and one by Capcom . As of 2023 [update] , the only three completely foreign games to achieve a perfect score are The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim by Bethesda Softworks , Grand Theft Auto V by Rockstar Games , and Ghost of Tsushima by Sucker Punch Productions .
