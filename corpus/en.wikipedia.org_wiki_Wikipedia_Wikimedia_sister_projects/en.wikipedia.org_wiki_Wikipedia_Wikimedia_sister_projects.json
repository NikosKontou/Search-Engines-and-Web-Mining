    "transformers_text": "Wikimedia sister projects are all the publicly available wikis operated by the Wikimedia Foundation including Wikipedia This guideline covers Wikipedia's relations to the sister projects including linking and copying content between a Wikipedia article and a sister project's article Wikipedia is written by volunteer editors and hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation a non profit organization that also hosts a range of other volunteer projects The above list of the current English language sister projects can be easily duplicated using the Wikipedia's sister projects template Wikipedia encourages links from Wikipedia articles to pages on sister projects when such links are likely to be useful to our readers and interlingua l cross linking to articles on foreign language editions of Wikipedia whenever such links are possible By far the most common use of links to the non Wikipedia sister projects is the use of images that are stored on the Wikimedia Commons site see Wikipedia Wikimedia Commons For example Links to sister projects are made in several ways Sister project links generally appear in the External links section or the last section whatever it is rather than the body of the article Wiktionary and Wikisource may be linked inline e g to an unusual word or the text of a document being discussed Appropriate material from Wikimedia Commons may also be included within the main body of an article See Embedding Commons ' media in Wikipedia articles Links to Wikinews should not be made within the main body of an article being made only as per the external links guideline Most box type templates such as Commons shown at right should be put at the beginning of the last section of the article which is usually but not necessarily the External links section so that boxes will appear next to rather than below the list items a Do not make a section whose sole content is box type templates Many box links can be unified to one by using Sister project links or Sister project Sometimes box type templates are not aesthetically pleasing either because there are no external links except sister project ones or because they result in an odd layout such as a long sequence of right aligned boxes hanging off the bottom of the article or excessive white space when the section is laid out in columns In such cases consider using inline templates such as Commons inline in the External links section so that links to sister projects appear as list items like this Another alternative to box type templates in the body of the article is a Sister bar navbox at the end of the article The sister links can be combined with portal links using Subject bar Sister project links are normally made only once within an article as with standard links to other Wikipedia articles Sometimes an entry is more appropriate on some other sister project than on Wikipedia because they are of a non encyclopedic scope e g they can never be expanded beyond a simple dictionary definition or call for a level of detail more appropriate to a textbook Normally such articles are copied to the more appropriate sister using the transwiki process and deleted from Wikipedia afterwards However if a word or phrase is commonly wikified it is quite likely that the deleted entry will be quickly re created again by well meaning users The re created article is likely to again become non encyclopedic To avoid this do seek deletion of the page or suppress after transwiki ' ing One solution as suggested by Wikipedia deletion policy is to instead normally redirect the word to a relevant article within Wikipedia For instance Organize could redirect to a well developed Organization article via REDIRECT Organization If this is not possible turn a Wikipedia page into a soft redirect to a sister project The plain soft redirect template should not be used in the mainspace Instead use one of the specialized templates see below These templates in form readers of information on the sister project in the case of this example one link would be provided to the wikt organize page This has multiple benefits Wikipedia does not have an article on wikimedia sister projects but its sister project Wiktionary does You can also Please keep in mind that only topics with a less than encyclopedic scope that are commonly wikified words or that are repeatedly recreated should become soft redirects We don't need a soft redirect for every possible word or phrase to be included in Wikipedia Mainspace exclusive Unified login is a mechanism which allows users to use a single login across the majority of the Wikimedia Foundation's sister projects This allows users to maintain a consistent identity throughout Wikimedia following a single sign up Other advantages of this mechanism include the removal of the threat that impersonation poses and the ability to visit many projects without having to go through the labors of logging in everywhere Users can create a unified login by visiting Special Merge Account on a project where they already have an account and following the prompts Yes you can copy parts of one sister project into another but you must link to the source article in your edit summary The exact edit summary and attribution required depends on how the sister project was licensed see WP SISTER COPY for more detailed instructions If the material is translated from another language see WP T FOL WP for instructions",
