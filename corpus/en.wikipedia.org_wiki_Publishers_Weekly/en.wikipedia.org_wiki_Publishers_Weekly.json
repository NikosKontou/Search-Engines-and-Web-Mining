    "transformers_text": "Publishers Weekly PW is an American weekly trade news magazine targeted at publishers librarians booksellers and literary agents Published continuously since 1872 it has carried the tagline The International News Magazine of Book Publishing and Book selling With 51 issues a year the emphasis today is on book reviews 2 The magazine was founded by bibliographer Frederick Ley p old tin the late 1860 s and had various titles until Ley p old t settled on the name The Publishers ' Weekly with an apostrophe in 1872 The publication was a compilation of information about newly published books collected from publishers and from other sources by Ley p old t for an audience of booksellers By 1876 The Publishers ' Weekly was being read by nine tenths of the booksellers in the country In 1878 Ley p old t sold The Publishers ' Weekly to his friend Richard Rogers Bow ker in order to free up time for his other bibliographic endeavors 3 Augusta Garrigue Ley p old t wife of Frederick Ley p old t stayed with the publication for thirty years 4 The publication eventually expanded to include features and articles 5 Harry Thurston Peck was the first editor in chief of The Book man which began in 1895 Peck worked on its staff from 1895 to 1906 and in 1895 he created the world's first bestseller list for its pages In 1912 Publishers Weekly began to publish its own bestseller lists patterned after the lists in The Book man These were not separated into fiction and non fiction until 1917 when World War I brought an increased interest in non fiction by the reading public 5 6 For much of the twentieth century Publishers Weekly was guided and developed by Frederic Gers hom Mel cher 1879 1963 who was editor and co editor of Publishers ' Weekly and chairman of the magazine's publisher R R Bow ker over four decades Born April 12 1879 in Malden Massachusetts Mel cher began at age 16 in Boston's Estes Lauri at Bookstore where he developed an interest in children's books 7 He moved to Indianapolis in 1913 for another bookstore job In 1918 he read in Publishers ' Weekly that the magazine's editorship was vacant He applied to Richard Rogers Bow ker for the job was hired and moved with his family to Montclair New Jersey He remained with R R Bow ker for 45 years 7 While at Publishers Weekly Mel cher began creating space in the publication and a number of issues dedicated solely to books for children 8 In 1919 he teamed with Franklin K Math i ews librarian for the Boy Scouts of America and Anne Carroll Moore a librarian at the New York Public Library to create Children's Book Week 7 When Bow ker died in 1933 Mel cher succeeded him as president of the company he resigned in 1959 to become chairman of the board of directors 5 9 In 1943 Publishers Weekly created the Carey Thomas Award for creative publishing naming it in honor of Mathew Carey and Isaiah Thomas 10 For most of its history Publishers Weekly along with the Library Journal related titles were owned by founding publisher R R Bow ker When Reed Publishing purchased Bow ker from Xerox in 1985 it placed Publishers Weekly under the management of its Boston based Cahn ers Publishing Company the trade publishing empire founded by Norman Cahn ers which Reed Publishing had purchased in 1977 The merger of Reed with the Netherlands based Else vier in 1993 led to many Cahn ers cutbacks amid takeover turmoil Nora Raw lins on who once headed a 4 million book selection budget at the Baltimore County Library System edited Library Journal for four years prior to becoming editor in chief of Publishers Weekly in 1992 where he served until 2005 In 2005 the magazine came under the direction of a new editor in chief veteran book reviewer Sara Nelson known for publishing columns in the New York Post and The New York Observer 11 Nelson began to modernize Publishers Weekly with new features and a makeover by illustrator and graphic designer Jean Claude Su are s The switch to a simple abbreviated logo of initials effectively changed the name of the magazine toP W the name long used for the magazine within the book industry 2 She also introduced the magazine's short lived Quill Awards with nominees in 19 categories selected by a nominating board of 6 000 booksellers and librarians Winners were determined by the reading public who could vote at kiosks in Borders stores or online at the Quills site Reed Business dropped the Quill Awards in 2008 12 Since 1872 the front covers of Publishers Weekly were used to display advertisements by book publishers PW editorial covers now feature illustrations and author photographs tied to interior articles these covers follow the front cover advertisement The visual motif of each cover is sometimes repeated on the contents page 2 The Nelson years were marked by turbulence within the industry as well as a continuing trend away from serious writing and towards pop culture Publishers Weekly has enjoyed a near monopoly over the past decades but now with vigorous competition from Internet sites e mail newsletters and daily newspapers 13 In 2008 faced with a decline in advertising support Reed's management sought a new direction In January 2009 Sara Nelson was dismissed along with executive editor Daisy Mary les who had been with PW for more than four decades Stepping in as editorial director was Brian Kenney editorial director of School Library Journal and Library Journal 2 The dismissals which sent shockwaves through the industry were widely covered in newspapers 14 In April 2010 George W Slow ik Jr a former publisher of the magazine purchased Publishers Weekly from Reed Business Information under the company PW xyz LLC C evin Br yer man remained as publisher along with co editors Jim Milli ot and Michael Coffey 2 On September 22 2011 PW began a series of weekly podcasts Beyond the Book PW's Week Ahead 15 In 2019 The Millions was acquired by PW xyz 16 PW maintains an online archive of past book reviews from January 1991 to the present 17 The earliest articles posted in PW's online archive date back to November 1995 A redesigned website was unveiled on May 10 2010 2 In 2008 the magazine's circulation was 25 000 In 2004 the breakdown of those 25 000 readers was given as 6000 publishers 5500 public libraries and public library systems 3800 booksellers 1600 authors and writers 1500 college and university libraries 950 print film and broad media and 750 literary and rights agents among others Subject areas covered by Publishers Weekly include publishing book selling marketing merchandising and trade news along with author interviews and regular columns on rights people in publishing and bestsellers It attempts to serve all involved in the creation production marketing and sale of the written word in book audio video and electronic formats The magazine increases the page count considerably for four annual special issues Spring Adult Announcements Fall Adult Announcements Spring Children's Announcements and Fall Children's Announcements 2 The book review section of Publishers Weekly was added in the early 1940 s and grew in importance during the 20 th century and through the present day when It currently offers pre publication reviews of 9 000 new trade books each year in a comprehensive range of genres and including audiobooks and e books with a digitized archive of 200 000 reviews Reviews appear two to four months prior to the publication date of a book and until 2014 when PW launched Book Life com a website for self published books books already in print were seldom reviewed 18 These anonymous reviews are short averaging 200 250 words and it is not unusual for the review section to run as long as 40 pages filling the second half of the magazine In the past a book review editorial staff of eight editors assigned books to more than 100 freelance reviewers Some are published authors and others are experts in specific genres or subjects Although it might take a week or more to read and analyze some books reviewers were paid 45 per review until June 2008 when the magazine introduced a reduction in payment to 25 a review In a further policy change that month reviewers received credit as contributors in issues carrying their reviews Currently there are nine reviews editors listed in the masthead Now titled Reviews the review section began life as Forecasts For several years that title was taken literally reviews were followed with italicized comments that attempted to predict a book's sales success Genevieve S tutt a ford who greatly expanded the number of reviews during her tenure as the nonfiction Forecasts editor joined the PW staff in 1975 Previously she was a Saturday Review associate editor reviewer for Kirkus Reviews and for 12 years on the staff of the San Francisco Chronicle During the 23 years S tutt a ford was with Publishers Weekly book reviewing was increased from an average of 3 800 titles a year in the 1970 s to well over 6 500 titles in 1997 She retired in 1998 2 19 Several notable PW editors stand out for making their mark on the magazine Barbara Bann on was the head fiction reviewer during the 1970 s and early 1980 s becoming the magazine's executive editor during that time and retiring in 1983 She was notably the first reviewer to insist that her name be appended to any blurb of her reviews thus drawing attention to herself to the review and to the influence of the magazine in predicting a book's popularity and sal ability 20 Sybil Steinberg came to Publishers Weekly in the mid 1970 s and served as a reviews editor for 30 years taking over after Barbara Bann on retired Under Steinberg PW instituted the starred review a first in the industry to indicate books of exceptional merit She also called out particular books of merit by starting the practice of boxed reviews a precursor to the PW signature reviews boxed reviews that are attributed to the reviewer The Best Books lists were also Steinberg's brainchild and these lists are still published annually usually in November ahead of Best Books lists from The New York Times and other prominent review venues Steinberg edited the magazine's author interviews and beginning in 1992 put together four anthologies of them in book form published by the Pushcart Press Formerly of In Style magazine novelist Louisa Erm eli no took the reins of the PW review section in 2005 Under her watch the number of reviews grew once again to nearly 9 000 per year from 6 500 citation needed In a sea change for the magazine Erm eli no oversaw the integration of self published book reviews into the main review section of the magazine Review editors vet and assign self published books for review which reviews are then published alongside the reviews of traditionally published books each week in the magazine 21 Publishers Weekly does charge for self published book reviews following the trend within the industry led by Kirkus Reviews and Foreword's Clarion fee for review service both of which offer independent book reviews in exchange for fees in the hundreds of dollars 22 23 Publishers Weekly does syndicate its reviews to a variety of online retail venues such as Amazon Apple Books Powell's Books Books a Million and others The reviews are also carried by library database services such as Baker and Taylor Pro Quest Bow ker C engage EBS CO and others",
