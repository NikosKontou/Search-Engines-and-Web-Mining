house moving through the air with her and To to still inside it Various figures float by including Gulch who morphs into a witch The house comes down in an unknown land which turns out to be Munch k inland in the Land of Oz Dorothy is greeted by a good witch named Glinda who in forms her that the house landed on the Wicked Witch of the East killing her The Munchkins celebrate the wicked witch's death until her sister the Wicked Witch of the West shows up Before she can seize her deceased sister's ruby slippers Glinda magically transports them on to Dorothy's feet and tells her to keep them on The wicked witch leaves but swears vengeance upon Dorothy and To to Glinda tells Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City the home of the Wizard of Oz as he might know how to help her return home Along the way Dorothy meets the Scarecrow who wants a brain the Tin Man who wants a heart and the Cowardly Lion who wants courage They reach the Emerald City despite the efforts of the Wicked Witch The wizard appears as a giant ghostly head and tells them he will grant their wishes if they bring him the Wicked Witch's broom During their quest Dorothy and To to are captured by flying monkeys and taken to the Wicked Witch's castle To to escapes and leads the Scarecrow Tin Man and Cowardly Lion to the castle They free Dorothy but are pursued and finally cornered by the Witch

the qualities they sought The Wizard reveals that he like Dorothy is from Kansas and accidentally arrived in Oz in a hot air balloon When he offers to take her back to Kansas with him aboard it she accepts but To to jumps out of her arms and she goes after him and the balloon accidentally lifts off with just the Wizard aboard Glinda then reappears and tells Dorothy she always had the power to return to Kansas using the ruby slippers but had to find that out for herself After sharing a tearful farewell with her friends Dorothy clicks her heels three times and repeats There's no place like home Dorothy awakens in her own bed in Kansas She recounts her adventures but Aunt Em says that she just had a bad dream Dorothy tells Professor Marvel and the farmhands that they were in Oz also and they smile humoring her As she hugs To to she gratefully exclaims Oh A untie Em there's no place like home In the film's closing credits whenever a Kansas character has a counterpart in Oz only that Kansas character is listed For example Frank Morgan is listed as playing Professor Marvel but not the Wizard of Oz The only Oz characters listed in the credits are Glinda Nikko and the Munchkins Production on the film began when Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 showed that films adapted from popular children's stories and fairytales could be successful 27 28 In January 1938 Metro Goldwyn Mayer bought the rights to L Frank Baum's popular novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz from Samuel Goldwyn Goldwyn had considered making the film as a vehicle for Eddie Cantor who was under contract to Samuel Goldwyn Productions and whom Goldwyn wanted to cast as the Scarecrow 28 The script went through several writers and revisions 2 Mervyn LeRoy's assistant William H Cannon had submitted a brief four page outline 2 Because recent fantasy films had not fared well he recommended toning down or removing the magical elements In his outline the Scarecrow was a man so stupid that the only employment open to him was scaring crows from cornfield s and the Tin Woodman was a criminal so heartless that he was sentenced to be placed in a tin suit for eternity This torture softened him into somebody gentler and kinder 2 Cannon's vision was similar to Larry Sem on's 1925 film adaptation in which the magical elements are absent Afterward LeRoy hired screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz who delivered a 17 page draft of the Kansas scenes A few weeks later Mankiewicz delivered a further 56 pages LeRoy also hired Noel Langley and poet Ogden Nash to write separate versions of the story None of these three knew about the others a common practice at the time Nash delivered a four page outline Langley turned in a 43 page treatment and a full film script Langley then turned in three more scripts this time incorporating the songs written by Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg Florence Ry ers on and Edgar Allan Woolf submitted a script and were brought on board to touch up the writing They were asked to ensure that the story stayed true to Baum's book However producer Arthur Freed was unhappy with their work and reassigned it to Langley 29 During filming Victor Fleming and John Lee Mah in revised the script further adding and cutting some scenes They completed the final draft of the script on October 8 1938 following numerous rewrites 30 Haley and Lahr are also known to have written some of their dialogue for the Kansas sequence Others who contributed to the adaptation without credit include three of the men who directed portions of the film or shoot a Richard Thorpe George Cukor and King Vid or along with other writers Irving Bre cher Herbert Fields Arthur Freed Yip Harburg Samuel Hoff en stein Jack Mint z and Sid Silvers Only Langley Ry ers on and Woolf were credited for the script 28 In addition songwriter Harburg's son and biographer Ernie Harburg reported So anyhow Yip also wrote all the dialogue in that time and the setup to the songs and he also wrote the part where they give out the heart the brains and the nerve because he was the final script editor And he there was eleven screenwriters on that and he pulled the whole thing together wrote his own lines and gave the thing a coherence and unity which made it a work of art But he doesn't get credit for that He gets lyrics by E Y Harburg you see But nevertheless he put his influence on the thing 31 Langley seems to have thought that a 1939 audience was too sophisticated to accept Oz as a straight ahead fantasy therefore it was re conceived as a lengthy elaborate dream sequence 32 28 Because they perceived a need to attract a youthful audience by appealing to modern fads and styles the score had featured a song called The Jitterbug and the script had featured a scene with a series of musical contests A spoiled selfish princess in Oz had outlawed all forms of music except classical music and operetta The princess challenged Dorothy to a singing contest in which Dorothy's swing style enchanted listeners and won the grand prize This part was initially written for Betty Jayne s 33 but was later dropped Another scene which was removed before final script approval and never filmed was an epilogue scene in Kansas after Dorothy's return Hunk the Kansan counterpart to the Scarecrow is leaving for an agricultural college and extracts a promise from Dorothy to write to him The scene implies that romance will eventually develop between the two which also may have been intended as an explanation for Dorothy's partiality for the Scarecrow over her other two companions This plot idea was never totally dropped and is especially noticeable in the final script when Dorothy just before she is to leave Oz tells the Scarecrow I think I'll miss you most of all 34 better source needed Much attention was given to the use of color in the production with the MGM production crew favoring some hues over others It took the studio's art department almost a week to settle on the shade of yellow used for the yellow brick road 35 Several actresses were reportedly considered for the part of Dorothy including Shirley Temple from 20 th Century Fox the most prominent child star at the time Deanna Durbin a relative newcomer with a recognized operatic voice and Judy Garland the most experienced of the three Officially the decision to cast Garland was attributed to contractual issues clarification needed Ray Bolger was originally cast as the Tin Man and Buddy Ebs en was to play the Scarecrow 30 Bolger however longed to play the Scarecrow as his childhood idol Fred Stone had done on stage in 1902 With that very performance Stone had inspired Bolger to become a vaud evil lian in the first place Now unhappy with his role as the Tin Man reportedly claiming I'm not a tin performer I'm fluid Bolger convinced producer Mervyn LeRoy to recast him in the part he so desired 36 Ebs en did not object after going over the basics of the Scarecrow's distinctive gait with Bolger as a professional dancer Ebs en had been cast because the studio was confident he would be up to the task of replicating the famous wobbly walk of Stone's Scarecrow he recorded all of his songs went through all the rehearsals as the Tin Man and began filming with the rest of the cast 15 W C Fields was originally chosen for the title role of the Wizard after Ed Wynn turned it down considering the part too small but the studio could not meet Fields ' fee 37 Wallace Beer y lobbied for the role but the studio refused to spare him during the long shooting schedule Instead another contract player Frank Morgan was cast on September 22 Veteran vaudeville performer Pat Wals he was best known for his performance as various monkeys in many theater productions and circus shows He was cast as Nikko the head Winged Monkey on September 28 traveling to MGM studios on October 3 An extensive talent search produced over a hundred dwarfs to play Munchkins this meant that most of the film's Oz sequences would have to be shot before work on the Munch k inland sequence could begin According to Munch kin actor Jerry M aren the dwarfs were each paid over 125 a week equivalent to 2 800 in 2024 Mein hard t Ra a be who played the coroner revealed in the 1990 documentary The Making of the Wizard of Oz that the MGM costume and wardrobe department under the direction of designer Adrian had to design over 100 costumes for the Munch kin sequences They photographed and cataloged each Munch kin in their costume so they could consistently apply the same costume and makeup each day of production Gale So nder ga ard was originally cast as the Wicked Witch of the West but withdrew from the role when the witch's person a shifted from sly and glamorous thought to emulate the Evil Queen in Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to the familiar ugly hag 38 She was replaced on October 10 1938 just two days before filming started by MGM contract player Margaret Hamilton So nder ga ard said in an interview for a bonus feature on the DVD that she had no regrets about turning down the part So nder ga ard would go on to play a glamorous feline villaines s in Fox's version of Maurice Maeterlinck's The Blue Bird in 1940 39 Hamilton played a role remarkably similar to the Wicked Witch in the Judy Garland film Babes in Arms 1939 According to Al jean Har metz the gone to seed coat worn by Morgan as the Wizard was selected from a rack of coats purchased from a second hand shop According to legend Morgan later discovered a label in the coat indicating it had once belonged to Baum Baum's widow confirmed this and the coat was eventually presented to her However Baum biographer Michael Patrick Hearn says the Baum family denies ever seeing the coat or knowing of the story Hamilton considered it a rumor concocted by the studio 40 The production faced the challenge of creating the Tin Man's costume Several tests were done to find the right makeup and clothes for Ebs en 41 Ten days into the shoot Ebs en suffered a toxic reaction after repeatedly inhaling the aluminum dust which his daughter Kiki Ebs en has said the studio misrepresented as an allergic reaction contained in the aluminum powder makeup he wore He recalled taking a breath one evening and nothin ' happened Ebs en's way of saying he wasn't receiving any air into his system He was hospitalized in critical condition He spent two weeks on oxygen and was subsequently forced to leave the project 42 43 In a later interview included on the 2005 DVD release of The Wizard of Oz he recalled that the studio heads appreciated the seriousness of his illness only after he was hospitalized Filming halted while a replacement for him was sought No footage of Ebs en as the Tin Man has ever been released only photos taken during filming and makeup tests His replacement Jack Haley assumed Ebs en had been fired 44 The makeup used for Haley was quietly changed to an aluminum paste with a layer of clown white greasepaint underneath in order to protect his skin Although it did not have the same dire effect on Haley he did at one point suffer an eye infection from it 43 To keep down on production costs Haley only rerecorded If I Only Had a Heart and solo lines during If I Only Had the Nerve and the scrapped song The Jitterbug as such Ebs en's voice can still be heard in the remaining songs featuring the Tin Man in group vocals LeRoy after reviewing the footage and feeling director Richard Thorpe was rushing the production adversely affecting the actors ' performances had Thorpe replaced During reorganization on the production George Cukor temporarily took over under LeRoy's guidance Initially the studio had made Garland wear a blonde wig and heavy baby doll makeup and she played Dorothy in an exaggerated fashion Cukor changed Garland's and Hamilton's makeup and costumes and told Garland to be herself This meant that all the scenes Garland and Hamilton had already completed had to be reshot Cukor also suggested the studio cast Jack Haley on loan from Fox as the Tin Man 45 Cukor did not shoot any scenes for the film but acted merely as a creative advisor to the troubled production His prior commitment to direct Gone with the Wind required him to leave on November 3 1938 when Victor Fleming assumed directorial responsibility As director Fleming chose not to shift the film from Cukor's creative realignment Producer LeRoy had already expressed his satisfaction with the film's new course All the Oz sequences were filmed in three strip Technicolor 28 2 requiring the use of large hot lights while the opening and closing credits and the Kansas sequences were filmed in black and white and colored in a sepia tone process 28 Sepia tone film was also used in the scene where Aunt Em appears in the Wicked Witch's crystal ball The Wizard of Oz was not the first film to use Technicolor 46 which had been introduced in The Gulf Between 1917 as a two color additive process Oz was also not the first to use three strip Technicolor the three color subtractive process officially known as Technicolor Process 4 which allowed for a wider range of reproducible hues compared to the earlier Technicolor processes Three strip Technicolor had its live action debut in a sequence for an earlier MGM feature the Jeanette MacDonald musical The Cat and the Fiddle 1934 and then made its first three strip Technicolor process that same year in a Travel talks ' travelogue short Holland in Tulip Time 1934 47 Becky Sharp 1935 a Pioneer Pictures RKO Radio production was the first feature fully produced in three strip Technicolor The Trail of the Lonesome Pine 1936 a Paramount Walter Wanger production which was the first fully produced film to be shot outdoors The Garden of Allah 1936 a Selznick International United Artists production was the third film fully produced in the process and another Jeanette MacDonald musical Sweethearts 1938 was MGM's first feature fully produced in the process four years earlier since the release of the Travel talks short film Holland in Tulip Time 48 49 It was during the production of Sweethearts that MGM made the decision to produce most of The Wizard of Oz in Technicolor 48 a decision also justified by the concurrent blockbuster success of another Technicolor RKO release Walt Disney's animated Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 50 Production on the bulk of the Technicolor sequences was a long and exhausting process that ran for over six months from October 1938 to March 1939 Most of the cast worked six days a week and had to arrive as early as 4 AM to be fitted with makeup and costumes and often did not leave until 7 PM or later Cumbersome makeup and costumes were made even more uncomfortable by the daylight bright lighting the early Technicolor process required which could heat the set to over 100 F 38 C this also had the side effect of bringing the production's electricity bill to a staggering estimate of 225 000 equivalent to 5 086 184 in 2024 51 Bolger later said that the frightening nature of the costumes prevented most of the Oz principals from eating in the studio commissary 52 and the toxicity of Hamilton's copper based makeup forced her to eat a liquid diet on shoot days 53 It took as many as twelve takes to have To to run alongside the actors as they skipped down the Yellow Brick Road In Hamilton's exit from Munch k inland a concealed elevator was installed to lower her below stage level as fire and smoke erupted to dramatize and conceal her exit The first take ran well but on the second take the burst of fire came too soon The flames set fire to her green copper based face paint causing third degree burns to her hands and face She spent three months recuperating before returning to work 54 Her green makeup had usually been removed with acetone due to its toxic copper content Because of Hamilton's burns makeup artist Jack Young removed the makeup with alcohol to prevent infection 2 In the decades since the film's release credible stories have come out indicating that Judy Garland endured extensive abuse during and before filming 55 56 57 58 The studio went to extreme lengths to change her appearance including binding her chest and giving her Benz e dr in e tablets to keep her weight down along with uppers and downers that caused giggling fits There were claims that various members of the cast pointed out her breasts and made other lewd comments Victor Fleming slapped her during the Cowardly Lion's introduction scene when Garland could not stop laughing at Lahr's performance Once the scene was done Fleming reportedly ashamed of himself ordered the crew to punch him in the face Garland however kissed him instead 59 60 She continued to wear false teeth that fit over her own upper teeth that were mis aligned She also wore a rubber disc in each nostril to change the shape of her nose She would wear the teeth and discs on camera for another five years until her involvement in Meet Me In St Louis whereupon makeup artist Dorothy Pone del promptly threw the teeth and discs in a drawer after Garland said I'm supposed to wear these 61 Claims have been made in memoirs that the frequently drunk actors portraying the Munchkins propositioned and pinched her 62 63 57 64 Garland said that she was groped by Louis B Mayer 55 65 Arnold Gillespie the film's special effects director employed several techniques 41 Developing the tornado scene was especially costly Gillespie used muslin cloth to make the tornado flexible after a previous attempt with rubber failed He hung the 35 ft 11 m of muslin from a steel gantry and connected the bottom to a rod By moving the gantry and rod he was able to create the illusion of a tornado moving across the stage Fuller's earth was sprayed from both the top and bottom using compressed air hoses to complete the effect Dorothy's house was recreated using a model 66 Stock footage of this tornado was later recycled for a climactic scene in the 1943 musical film Cabin in the Sky directed by Judy Garland's eventual second husband Vincent e Minnelli 67 The Cowardly Lion and Scarecrow masks were made of foam latex makeup created by makeup artist Jack Dawn Dawn was one of the first to use this technique 68 69 It took an hour each day to slowly peel Bolger's glued on mask from his face a process that eventually left permanent lines around his mouth and chin 70 71 The Tin Man's costume was made of leather covered buckram and the oil used to grease his joints was made from chocolate syrup 72 The Cowardly Lion's costume was made from real lion skin and fur 73 Due to the heavy makeup Bert Lahr could only consume soup and milkshakes on break which eventually made him sick After a few months Lahr put his foot down and requested normal meals along with makeup redo s after lunch 74 75 For the horse of a different color scene Jell O powder was used to color the white horses 76 Asbestos was used to achieve some of the special effects such as the witch's burning broomstick and the fake snow that covers Dorothy as she sleeps in the field of poppies 77 78 The Wizard of Oz is famous for its musical selections and soundtrack Its songs were composed by Harold Arlen with lyrics byE Y Yip Harburg They won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for Over the Rainbow The song ranks first in the AFI's 100 Years 100 Songs and the Recording Industry Association of America's 365 Songs of the Century MGM composer Herbert S to th art a well known Hollywood composer and songwriter won the Academy Award for Best Original Score Georgie S toll was associate conductor and screen credit was given to George Bass man Murray Cutter Ken Darby and Paul Marquardt for orchestral and vocal arrangements As usual Roger Edens was also heavily involved as an un billed musical associate to Freed citation needed The songs were recorded on the studio's scoring stage before filming Several of the recordings were completed while Ebs en was still with the cast Although he had to be dropped from the cast because of a dangerous reaction to his aluminum powder makeup his singing voice remained on the soundtrack as mentioned in the notes for the CD Deluxe Edition He can be heard in the group vocals of We're Off to See the Wizard Bolger's original recording of If I Only Had a Brain was far more sedate than the version in the film During filming Cukor and LeRoy decided a more energetic rendition better suited Dorothy's initial meeting with the Scarecrow and it was rerecorded The original version was considered lost until a copy was discovered in 2009 79 All lyrics are written by E Y Harburg all music is composed by Harold Arlen Some musical pieces were filmed and deleted later in the editing process The song The Jitterbug written in a swing style was intended for a sequence where the group journeys to the Witch's castle Owing to time constraints it was cut from the final theatrical version The film footage of the song has been lost although silent 8 mm color home film footage of the rehearsals has survived The audio recording of the song was preserved and was included in the 1995 Rhino Records two CD deluxe edition of the soundtrack as well as on the film's VHS and DVD editions A reference to The Jitterbug remains in the film The Witch tells her flying monkeys that they should have no trouble apprehending Dorothy and her friends because I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them 80 Another musical number cut before release came right after the Wicked Witch of the West was melted and before Dorothy and her friends returned to the Wizard This was a reprise of Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead blended with We're Off to See the Wizard and The Merry Old Land of Oz with the lyrics altered to Hail Hail The witch is dead This started with the Witch's guard saying Hail to Dorothy The Wicked Witch is dead and dissolved to a huge celebration by the citizens of the Emerald City who sang the song as they accompanied Dorothy and her friends to the Wizard Today the film of this scene is also lost and only a few stills survive along with a few seconds of footage used on several reissue trailers The entire audio track was preserved and is included on the two CD Rhino Record deluxe soundtrack edition 81 Garland was to sing a brief reprise of Over the Rainbow while Dorothy was trapped in the Witch's castle but it was cut because it was considered too emotionally intense Because Garland sang the reprise live on set only the underscoring from the final edit survives However the on set audio of the scene when it was originally filmed under Richard Thorpe still exists and was included as an extra in all home media releases from 1993 onward The Deluxe Edition soundtrack marries the singing from the Thorpe take to the underscoring from the Fleming version to approximate what this would have sounded like 82 Extensive edits in the film's final cut removed vocals from the last portion of the film However the film was fully underscored with instrumental snippets from the film's various leitmotifs throughout There was also some recognizable classical and popular music including This list is excerpted from the liner notes of the Rhino Records collection Principal photography concluded with the monochromatic Kansas sequences on March 16 1939 When Victor Fleming was called away to replace George Cukor as director of Gone with the Wind veteran director King Vid or agreed to direct Oz during its final ten days of principal production This included the bulk of the Kansas scenes including Garland's performance of Over the Rainbow 83 Re shoots and pickup shots were done through April and May and into June under the direction of producer LeRoy When the Over the Rainbow reprise was removed after subsequent test screenings in early June Garland had to be brought back to re shoot the A untie Em I'm frightened scene without the song The footage of Bland ick's Aunt Em as shot by Vid or had already been set aside for rear projection work and was reused After Hamilton's severe injuries with the Munch k inland elevator she refused to do the pickups for the scene where she flies on a broomstick that billows smoke so LeRoy had stunt double Betty Danko perform instead Danko was severely injured when the smoke mechanism malfunctioned 84 At this point the film began a long arduous post production Herbert S to th art composed the film's background score while A Arnold Gillespie perfected the special effects including many of the rear projection shots The MGM art department created matte paintings for many scene backgrounds A significant innovation planned for the film was the use of stencil printing for the transition to Technicolor Each frame was to be hand tinted to maintain the sepia tone However it was abandoned because it was too expensive and labor intensive and MGM used a simpler less expensive technique During the May re shoots the inside of the farmhouse was painted sepia and when Dorothy opens the door it is not Garland but her stand in Bobbie Kos hay wearing a sepia gingham dress who then backs out of frame Once the camera moves through the door Garland steps back into frame in her bright blue gingham dress as noted in DVD extras and the sepia painted door briefly tints her with the same color before she emerges from the house's shadow into the bright glare of the Technicolor lighting This also meant that the re shoots provided the first proper shot of Munch k inland Test screenings of the film began on June 5 1939 85 Oz initially ran nearly two hours long In 1939 the average film ran for about 90 minutes LeRoy and Fleming knew they needed to cut at least 15 minutes to get the film down to a manageable running time Three sneak previews in San Bernardino Pomona and San Luis Obispo California guided LeRoy and Fleming in the cutting Among the many cuts were The Jitterbug number the Scarecrow's elaborate Busby Berkeley directed dance sequence following If I Only Had a Brain reprises of Over the Rainbow and Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead and a number of smaller dialogue sequences This left the final mostly serious portion of the film with no songs only the dramatic underscoring Over the Rainbow was almost deleted MGM felt that it made the Kansas sequence too long as well as being far over the heads of the target audience of children The studio also thought that it was degrading for Garland to sing in a barnyard LeRoy uncredited associate producer Arthur Freed and director Fleming fought to keep it in and they eventually won The song went on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song and came to be identified so strongly with Garland herself that she made it her signature song After the preview in San Luis Obispo in early July the film was officially released in August 1939 at its current 101 minute running time The film premiered at the Orpheum Theatre in Green Bay Wisconsin on August 10 1939 86 although this is disputed by the August 23 1939 issue of The Exhibitor which places the debut a day earlier in New Bedford Massachusetts 87 The first sneak preview was held in San Bernardino California 88 The film was previewed in three test markets Kenosha Wisconsin on August 11 1939 Dennis Massachusetts also on August 11 89 90 and the Strand Theatre in Oc on omo woc Wisconsin on August 12 91 The Hollywood premiere was on August 15 1939 90 at Grauman's Chinese Theatre 92 The New York City premiere held at Loe w's Capitol Theatre on August 17 1939 was followed by a live performance with Garland and her frequent film co star Mickey Rooney They continued to perform there after each screening for a week Garland extended her appearance for two more weeks partnered with Rooney for a second week and with Oz co stars Ray Bolger and Bert Lahr for the third and final week The film opened nationwide on August 25 1939 one week before the Invasion of Poland which started World War II MGM sold CBS the rights to televise the film for 225 000 equivalent to 1 98 million in 2024 per broadcast 93 It was first shown

Sphere's i mmer sive sound system in addition to having the entire score re recorded with an 80 piece orchestra under the direction of David Newman on the same scoring stage where it was originally recorded 128 The project has had a mixed reception 129 A soundtrack of this version of the film was released on November 7 2025 with an a cappella version of Over the Rainbow sung by Judy Garland 130 The Wizard of Oz received universal acclaim upon its release 131 132 Writing for The New York Times Frank Nugent considered the film a delightful piece of wonder working which had the youngsters ' eyes shining and brought a quietly amused gleam to the wiser ones of the old ster s Not since Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has anything quite so fantastic succeeded half so well 133 Nugent had issues with some of the film's special effects with the best of will and ingenuity they cannot make a Munch kin or a Flying Monkey that will not still suggest however vaguely a Singer's Midget in a Jack Dawn masquerade Nor can they without a few betraying jolts and split screen overlapping s bring down from the sky the great soap bubble in which Glinda rides and roll it smoothly into place 133 According to Nugent Judy Garland's Dorothy is a pert and fresh faced miss with the wonder lit eyes of a believer in fairy tales but the Baum fantasy is at its best when the Scarecrow the Tin Man and the Lion are on the move 133 Writing in Variety John C Flinn predicted that the film was likely to perform some record breaking feats of box office magic noting Some of the scenic passages are so beautiful in design and composition as to stir audiences by their sheer unfold ment He also called Garland an appealing figure and the musical numbers gay and bright 134 Harrison's Reports wrote Even though some persons are not interested in pictures of this type it is possible that they will be eager to see this picture just for its technical treatment The performances are good and the incidental music is of considerable aid Pictures of this caliber bring credit to the industry 135 Film Daily wrote Leo the Lion is privileged to herald this one with his deepest roar the one that comes from way down for seldom if indeed ever has the screen been so successful in its approach to fantasy and extravaganza through flesh and blood handsomely mounted fairy story in Technicolor with its wealth of humor and homespun philosophy its stimulus to the imagination its procession of unforgettable settings its studding of merry tunes should click solidly at the box office 136 Some reviews were less positive Some movie goers felt that the 16 year old Garland was slightly too old to play the little girl who Baum intended his Dorothy to be Russell Maloney of The New Yorker wrote that the film displayed no trace of imagination good taste or ingenuity and declared it a stinker oo 137 while Otis Ferguson of The New Republic wrote It has dwarfs music Technicolor freak characters and Judy Garland It can't be expected to have a sense of humor as well and as for the light touch of fantasy it weighs like a pound of fruitcake soaking wet 138 Still the film placed seventh on Film Daily's year end nationwide poll of 542 critics naming the best films of 1939 139 According to MGM records during the film's initial release it earned 2 048 000 in the U S and 969 000 in other countries throughout the world for total earnings of 3 017 000 However its high production cost plus the costs of marketing distribution and other services resulted in it not being a financial success during its initial release and a loss of 1 145 000 for the studio 8 140 It would not break even until its 1949 re release 140 which earned it an additional 1 5 million about 16 million in 2024 Christopher Finch author of the Judy Garland biography Rainbow The Stormy Life of Judy Garland wrote Fantasy is always a risk at the box office The film had been enormously successful as a book and it had also been a major stage hit but previous attempts to bring it to the screen had been dismal failures He also wrote that after the film proved to be popular Garland signed a new contract with MGM giving her a substantial increase in salary making her one of the top ten box office stars in the United States 141 The film was also re released domestically in 1955 Subsequent re releases between 1989 and 2019 have grossed 25 173 032 worldwide 9 for a total worldwide gross of 29 690 032 The film was not the first to use color but the way in which the film was saturated with Technicolor proved that color could provide a magical element to fantasy films The film is iconic for its symbols such as the Yellow Brick Road ruby slippers Emerald City Munchkins and the phrase There's no place like home 142 The film became a global phenomenon and is still well known today 143 Roger Ebert included it in his canon of Great Movies writing that The Wizard of Oz has a wonderful surface of comedy and music special effects and excitement but we still watch it six decades later because its underlying story penetrates straight to the deepest insecurities of childhood stirs them and then reassures them 144 In his 1992 appreciation of the film for the British Film Institute author Salman Rushdie acknowledged its effect on him noting The Wizard of Oz was my very first literary influence 145 InStep Across This Line he wrote When I first saw The Wizard of Oz it made a writer of me 146 His first short story written at the age of 10 was titled Over the Rainbow 146 It was the favorite film of David Lynch who referenced it regularly in his own work 147 The references Lynch made to it are explored in Alexandre O Philippe's documentary Lynch Oz 2022 148 In a 2009 retrospective article about the film San Francisco Chronicle film critic and author Mick LaSalle declared the entire Munch k inland sequence from Dorothy's arrival in Oz to her departure on the yellow brick road has to be one of the greatest in cinema history a masterpiece of set design costuming choreography music lyrics storytelling and sheer imagination 149 In 2018 it was named the most influential film of all time as the result of a study conducted by the University of Turin to measure the success and significance of 47 000 films from around the world using data from readers and audience polls as well as internet sources such as IMDb It would top the list in their study followed by the Star Wars franchise Psycho 1960 King Kong 1933 and 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968 rounding out the top 5 150 On the film review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes The Wizard of Oz has a 98 rating based on 170 reviews with an average score of 9 4 10 Its critical consensus reads An absolute masterpiece whose groundbreaking visuals and deft storytelling are still every bit as resonant The Wizard of Oz is a must see film for young and old 151 At Metacritic which assigns a normalized rating to reviews the film received a score of 92 out of 100 based on 30 reviews indicating universal acclaim 152 The film was included by the Vatican in a list of important films compiled in 1995 under the category of Art 153 In 2019 Bright Lights Film Journal published Amy Kenyon's memoir analysis The Wizard of Oz at 80 Archive of a Rust Belt Girl In November 2024 it became the oldest film in history to join Letterbox d's One Million Watched Club and held this distinction until Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs joined the club in March 2025 154 Many notable people in the world of entertainment have voiced their admiration for the film and its

Williams actors Josh Gad Cai lee Spa en y and Michelle Yeo h and musician Alex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys 155 156 157 158 159 160 The American Film Institute AFI has compiled various lists which
