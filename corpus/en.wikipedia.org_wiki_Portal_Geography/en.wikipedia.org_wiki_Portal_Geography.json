Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of Earth and its human and natural complexities —not merely where objects are, but also how they have changed and come to be. While geography is specific to Earth, many concepts can be applied more broadly to other celestial bodies in the field of planetary science . Geography has been called \"a bridge between natural science and social science disciplines.\"\n\nThe history of geography as a discipline spans cultures and millennia, being independently developed by multiple groups, and cross-pollinated by trade between these groups. Geography as a discipline dates back to the earliest attempts to understand the world spatially, with the earliest example of an attempted world map dating to the 9th century BCE in ancient Babylon . Origins of many of the concepts in geography can be traced to Greek Eratosthenes of Cyrene, who may have coined the term \"geographia\" ( c. 276 BC – c. 195/194 BC ). The first recorded use of the word γεωγραφία was as the title of a book by Greek scholar Claudius Ptolemy (100 – 170 AD). During the Middle Ages, geography was influenced by Islamic scholars, like Muhammad al-Idrisi , producing detailed maps of the world. The Age of Discovery was influential in the development of geography, as European explorers mapped the New World . Modern developments include the development of geomatics and geographic information science .\n\nThe core concepts of geography consistent between all approaches are a focus on space, place, time, and scale. Today, geography is an extremely broad discipline with multiple approaches and modalities. The main branches of geography are physical geography , human geography , and technical geography . Physical geography focuses on the natural environment, human geography focuses on how humans interact with the Earth, and technical geography focuses on the development of tools for understanding geography. Techniques employed can generally be broken down into quantitative and qualitative approaches, with many studies taking mixed-methods approaches. Common techniques include cartography , remote sensing , interviews , and surveying . ( Full article... )\n\nNorth America is a continent in the Northern and Western hemispheres. North America is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean , to the east by the Atlantic Ocean , to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea , and to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean . The region includes Middle America comprising the Caribbean , Central America , and Northern America .

A principal scientist on the USGS monitoring team, Johnston was killed in the eruption while manning an observation post six miles (10 km) away on the morning of May 18, 1980. He was the first to report the eruption, transmitting \"Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!\" before he was swept away by a lateral blast ; despite a thorough search, Johnston's body was never found, but state highway workers discovered remnants of his USGS trailer in 1993.\n\nJohnston's career took him across the United States, where he studied the Augustine Volcano in Alaska , the San Juan volcanic field in Colorado , and long-extinct volcanoes in Michigan . Johnston was a meticulous and talented scientist, known for his analyses of volcanic gases and their relationship to eruptions. This, along with his enthusiasm and positive attitude, made him liked and respected by many co-workers. After his death, other scientists lauded his character, both verbally and in dedications and letters. Johnston felt scientists must do what is necessary, including taking risks, to help protect the public from natural disasters . His work, and that of fellow USGS scientists, convinced authorities to close Mount St. Helens to the public before the 1980 eruption. They maintained the closure despite heavy pressure to re-open the area. His story became intertwined with the popular image of volcanic eruptions and their threat to society, and a part of volcanology's history. To date, Johnston, along with his mentee Harry Glicken , is one of two American volcanologists known to have died in a volcanic eruption.
