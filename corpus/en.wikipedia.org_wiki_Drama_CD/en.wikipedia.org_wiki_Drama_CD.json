    "transformers_text": "Radio drama or audio drama audio play radio play 1 radio theatre or audio theatre is a drama tis ed purely acoustic performance With no visual component radio drama depends on dialogue music and sound effects to help the listener imagine the characters and story It is auditory in the physical dimension but equally powerful as a visual force in the psychological dimension 2 Radio drama includes plays specifically written for radio docudrama drama tis ed works of fiction as well as plays originally written for the theatre including musical theatre and opera Radio drama achieved widespread popularity within a decade of its initial development in the 1920 s By the 1940 s it was a leading international popular entertainment With the advent of television in the 1950 s radio drama began losing its audience However it remains popular in much of the world Recordings of O TR old time radio survive today in the audio archives of collectors libraries and museums as well as several online sites such as the Internet Archive By the 21 st century radio drama had a minimal presence on terrestrial radio in the United States with much American radio drama being restricted to rebroadcasts of programmes from previous decades However other nations still have thriving traditions of radio drama In the United Kingdom for example the BBC produces and broadcasts hundreds of new radio plays each year on Radio 3 Radio 4 and Radio 4 Extra Like the US Australia's network the ABC has abandoned broadcasting drama but in New Zealand on R NZ continues to promote and broadcast a variety of drama over its airwaves Thanks to advances in digital recording and Internet distribution radio drama experienced a revival around 2010 3 Podcasting offered the means of inexpensively creating new radio dramas in addition to the distribution of vintage programs The terms audio drama 4 or audio theatre are sometimes used synonymously with radio drama however audio drama or audio theatre may not necessarily be intended specifically for broadcast on radio Audio drama can also be found on CDs cassette tapes podcasts webcasts or other digital downloads as well as broadcast radio The Roman playwright Seneca has claim as a forerunner of radio drama because his plays were performed by readers as sound plays not by actors as stage plays In this respect Seneca had no significant successors until 20 th century technology made possible the widespread dissemination of sound plays 5 Radio drama traces its roots back to the 1880 s In 1881 French engineer Clement A der had filed a patent for ' improvements of Telephone Equipment in Theatres ' Th troph one 6 English language radio drama seems to have started in the United States 7 A Rural Line on Education a brief sketch specifically written for radio aired on Pittsburgh's K DKA in 1921 according to historian Bill Jake r 8 Newspaper accounts of the era report on a number of other drama experiments by America's commercial radio stations KY W broadcast a season of complete operas from Chicago starting in November 1921 9 In February 1922 entire Broadway musical comedies with the original casts aired from W J Z's Newark studios 10 Actors Grace George and Herbert Hayes performed an entire play from a San Francisco station in the summer of 1922 11 An important turning point in radio drama came when Schenectady New York's W GY after a successful tryout on 3 August 1922 began weekly studio broadcasts of full length stage plays in September 1922 12 using music sound effects and a regular troupe of actors The W GY Players Aware of this series the director of Cincinnati's W LW began regularly broadcasting one acts as well as excerpts from longer works in November 13 The success of these projects led to imitators at other stations By early 1923 original dramatic pieces written specially for radio were airing on stations in Cincinnati When Love Wakens by W LW's Fred Smith 13 14 Philadelphia The Secret Wave by Clyde A Cris well 15 and Los Angeles At Home over KH J 16 That same year W LW in May and W GY in September sponsored scripting contests inviting listeners to create original plays to be performed by those stations ' dramatic troupes 13 17 Listings in The New York Times 18 and other sources for May 1923 reveal at least 20 dramatic offerings were scheduled including one acts excerpts from longer dramas complete three and four act plays operettas and a Moli re adaptation either as in studio productions or by remote broadcast from local theatres and opera houses An early British drama broadcast was of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream on 2 LOon 25 July 1923 19 Serious study of American radio drama of the 1920 s and early 1930 s is at best very limited Unsung pioneers of the art include W LW's Fred Smith Freeman Gos den and Charles C orrell who popularised the dramatic serial The Eve ready Hour creative team which began with one act plays but was soon experimenting with hour long combinations of drama and music on its weekly variety program the various acting troupes at stations like W LW W GY K GO and a number of others frequently run by women like Helen Schuster Martin and Wild a Wilson Church early network continuity writers like Henry Fisk Carlton William Ford Manley and Don Clark producers and directors like Clarence Men ser and Gerald Stop p and a long list of others who were credited at the time with any number of innovations but who are largely forgotten or un discussed today Elizabeth McLeod's 2005 book on Gos den and C orrell's early work 20 is a major exception as is Richard J Hand's 2006 study of horror radio which examines some programs from the late 1920 s and early 1930 s 21 Another notable early radio drama one of the first specially written for the medium in the UK was A Comedy of Danger by Richard Hughes broadcast by the BBC on 15 January 1924 about a group of people trapped in a Welsh coal mine 22 One of the earliest and most influential French radio plays was the prize winning Mar moto ' Sea quake ' by Gabriel Germ in et and Pierre Cus y which presents a realistic account of a sinking ship before revealing that the characters are actually actors rehearsing for a broadcast Translated and broadcast in Germany and England by 1925 the play was originally scheduled by Radio Paris to air on 23 October 1924 but was instead banned from French radio until 1937 because the government feared that the dramatic SOS messages would be mistaken for genuine distress signals 23 In 1951 American writer and producer Arch O bole r suggested that Wy ll is Cooper's Lights Out 1934 47 was the first true radio drama to make use of the unique qualities of radio Radio drama as distinguished from theatre plays boiled down to kilocycle size began at midnight in the middle thirties on one of the upper floors of Chicago's Merchandise Mart The papp y was a rotund writer by the name of Wy ll is Cooper 24 Though the series is often remembered solely for its gruesome stories and sound effects Cooper's scripts for Lights Out were later recognised as well written and offered innovations seldom heard in early radio dramas including multiple first person narrators stream of consciousness monologues and scripts that contrasted a duplicitous character's internal monologue and his spoken words The question of who was the first to write stream of consciousness drama for radio is a difficult one to answer By 1930 Tyrone Guthrie had written plays for the BBC like Matrimonial News which consists entirely of the thoughts of a shopgirl awaiting a blind date and The Flowers Are Not for You to Pick which takes place inside the mind of a drowning man After they were published in 1931 Guthrie's plays aired on the American networks Around the same time Guthrie himself also worked for the Canadian National Railway radio network producing plays written by Merrill Denison that used similar techniques A 1940 article in Variety credited a 1932 NBC play Drink Deep by Don Johnson as the first stream of consciousness play written for American radio The climax of Lawrence Hol comb's 1931 NBC play Skyscraper also uses a variation of the technique so that the listener can hear the final thoughts and relived memories of a man falling to his death from the title building There were probably earlier examples of stream of consciousness drama on the radio For example in December 1924 actor Paul Robeson then appearing in a revival of Eugene O ' Neill's The Emperor Jones performed a scene from the play over New York's W GB S to critical acclaim Some of the many storytellers and monolog uist s on early 1920 s American radio might be able to claim even earlier dates Perhaps America's most famous radio drama broadcast is Orson Welles ' The War of the Worlds a 1938 version of H G Wells ' novel which inspired stories of a mass panic that though greatly exaggerated signaled the power of the form 25 By the late 1930 s radio drama was widely popular in the United States and also in other parts of the world There were dozens of programs in many different genres from mysteries and thrillers to soap operas and comedies Among American playwrights screenwriters and novelists who got their start in radio drama are Rod Serling and Irwin Shaw In Britain however during the 1930 s BBC programming tended to be more high brow including the works of Shakespeare Classical Greek drama as well as the works of major modern playwrights such as Chekhov Ibsen St rind berg and so forth Novels and short stories were also frequently drama tis ed 26 In addition the plays of contemporary writers and original plays were produced with for example a broadcast of T S Eliot's famous verse play Murder in the Cathedral in 1936 27 By 1930 the BBC was producing twice as many plays as London's West End and were producing over 400 plays a year by the mid 1940 s 28 Producers of radio drama soon became aware that adapting stage plays for radio did not always work and that there was a need for plays specifically written for radio which recognised its potential as a distinct and different medium from the theatre George Bernard Shaw's plays for example were seen as readily adaptable 29 However in a lead article in the BBC literary journal The Listener of 14 August 1929 which discussed the broadcasting of 12 great plays it was suggested that while the theatrical literature of the past should not be neglected the future lay mainly with plays written specifically for the microphone In 1939 40 the BBC founded its own Drama Repertory Company which made a stock of actors readily available After the war the number was around 50 They performed in the great number of plays broadcast in the heyday of BBC radio drama of the 40 s 60 s 30 Initially the BBC resisted American style ' soap opera ' but eventually highly popular serials like Dick Barton Special Agent 1946 51 Mrs Dale's Diary 1948 69 and The Archers 1950 were produced The Archers is still running as of July 2024 update and is the world's longest running soap opera with a total of over 18 400 episodes 31 There had been some earlier serial is ed drama including the six episode The Shadow of the Swastika 1939 Dorothy L S ayers's The Man Born To Be King in twelve episodes 1941 and Front Line Family 1941 48 which was broadcast to America as part of the effort to encourage the US to enter the war The s how's storylines depicted the trials and tribulations of a British family the Robinsons living through the war This featured plots about rationing family members missing in action and the Blitz After the war in 1946 it was moved to the BBC Light Programme 32 The BBC continued producing various kinds of drama including do cu drama throughout World War II amongst the writers they employed were the novelist James Hanley 33 and poet Louis Mac Neice who in 1941 became an employee of the BBC's Mac Neice's work for the BBC initially involved writing and producing radio programmes intended to build support for the US and later Russia through cultural programmes emphasising links between the countries rather than outright propaganda By the end of the war Mac Neice had written well over 60 scripts for the BBC including Christopher Columbus 1942 which starred Laurence Olivier The Dark Tower 1946 and a six part radio adaptation of Goethe's Faust 1949 34 Following World War II the BBC reorganised its radio provision introducing two new channels to supplement the BBC Home Service itself the result of the fusion in September 1939 of the pre war National and Regional Programmes These were the BBC Light Programme dating from 29 July 1945 and a direct successor to the wartime General Forces Programme and the BBC Third Programme launched on 29 September 1946 The BBC Light Programme while principally devoted to light entertainment and music carried a fair share of drama both single plays generally as the name of the station indicated of a lighter nature and serials In contrast the BBC Third Programme destined to become one of the leading cultural and intellectual forces in post war Britain specialised in heavier drama as well as the serious music talks and other features which made up its content long form productions of both classical and modern experimental dramatic works sometimes occupied the major part of its output on any given evening The Home Service meanwhile continued to broadcast more middle brow drama one off plays and serial is at ions daily The high water mark for BBC radio drama was the 1950 s and 1960 s and during this period many major British playwrights either effectively began their careers with the BBC or had works adapted for radio Most of playwright Cary l Churchill's early experiences with professional drama production were as a radio playwright and starting in 1962 with The Ants she wrote nine productions with BBC radio drama up until 1973 when her stage work began to be recognised at the Royal Court Theatre 35 Joe Orton's dramatic debut in 1963 was the radio play The Ruffian on the Stair which was broadcast on 31 August 1964 36 Tom Stoppard's first professional production was in the 15 minute Just Before Midnight programme on BBC Radio which showcased new dramatists 36 John Mortimer made his radio debut as a dramatist in 1955 with his adaptation of his own novel Like Men Betrayed for the BBC Light Programme However he made his debut as an original playwright with The Dock Brief starring Michael Hordern as a hapless barrister first broadcast in 1957 on BBC Third Programme later televised with the same cast and subsequently presented in a double bill with What Shall We Tell Caroline at the Lyric Hammersmith in April 1958 before transferring to the Garrick Theatre Mortimer is most famous for Rum pole of the Bailey a British television series which starred Leo McKern as Horace Rum pole an aging London barrister who defends any and all clients It has been spun off into a series of short stories novels and radio programmes 37 Giles Cooper was a pioneer in writing for radio becoming prolific in both radio and television drama His early successes included radio drama tis at ions of Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist William Golding's Lord of the Flies 38 and John Wyndham's classic science fiction novel The Day of the Tr if fids 39 He was also successful in the theatre The first of his radio plays to make his reputation was Math ry Beacon 1956 about a small detachment of men and women still guarding a Top Secret missile deflector somewhere in Wales years after the war has ended 40 Bill Naughton's radio play Alfie Elk in s and his Little Life 1962 was first broadcast on the BBC Third Programme on 7 January 1962 In it Alfie w it h sublime amorality swaggers and philo soph is es his way through life 41 The action spans about two decades from the beginning of World War II to the late 1950 s In 1964 Bill Naughton turned it into a stage play which was put on at London's Mermaid Theatre Later he wrote the screenplay for a film version Alfie 1966 starring Michael Caine Other notable radio dramatists included Henry Reed Brendan Be han Rhys Adrian Alan P later Anthony Ming hell a Alan Ble as dale and novelist Angela Carter Novelist Susan Hill also wrote for BBC Radio from the early 1970 s 39 Henry Reed was especially successful with the Hilda Tablet plays Irish playwright Brendan Be han author of The Qu are Fellow 1954 was commissioned by the BBC to write a radio play The Big House 1956 prior to this he had written two plays for Irish radio Moving Out and A Garden Party 42 Among the most famous works created for radio are Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood 1954 Samuel Beckett's All That Fall 1957 Harold Pinter's A Slight Ache 1959 and Robert Bolt's A Man for All Seasons 1954 43 Beckett wrote a number of short radio plays in the 1950 s and 1960 s and later for television his radio play Embers was first broadcast on the BBC Third Programme on 24 June 1959 and won the RAI prize at the Prix Italia awards later that year 44 Robert Bolt's writing career began with scripts for Children's Hour 45 A Man for All Seasons was subsequently produced on television in 1957 Then in 1960 there was a highly successful stage production in London's West End and on New York's Broadway from late 1961 In addition there have been two film versions in 1966 starring Paul Sco field and 1988 for television starring Charlton Heston 46 While Alan Ayckbourn did not write for radio many of his stage plays were subsequently adapted for radio Other significant adaptations included drama tis ed readings of poet David Jones's In Parenthesis in 1946 and The Anathema tain 1953 for the BBC Third Programme 47 and novelist Wyndham Lewis's The Human Age 1955 48 Among contemporary novels that were drama tis ed were the 1964 radio adaptation of Stan Barstow's A Kind of Loving 1960 there had also been a 1962 film adaptation 49 After the advent of television radio drama never recovered its popularity in the United States Most remaining CBS and NBC radio dramas were cancelled in 1960 50 The last network radio dramas to originate during American radio's Golden Age Suspense and Yours Truly Johnny Dollar ended on 30 September 1962 51 52 There have been some efforts at radio drama since then In the 1960 s Dick Or kin created the popular syndicated comic adventure series Chicken Man ABC Radio aired a daily dramatic anthology program Theater Five in 1964 65 Inspired by The Goon Show the four or five crazy guys of the Fire sign Theatre built a large following with their satirical plays on recordings exploring the dramatic possibilities inherent in stereo A brief resurgence of production beginning in the early 1970 s yielded Rod Serling's The Zero Hour for Mutual National Public Radio's Ear play and veteran Him an Brown's CBS Radio Mystery Theater and General Mills Radio Adventure Theater These productions were later followed by the Sears Mutual Radio Theater The National Radio Theater of Chicago NPR Playhouse and a newly produced episode of the former 1950 s series X Minus One Works by a new generation of dramatists also emerged at this time notably Yuri Raso v sky Thomas Lopez of ZB S and the dramatic sketches heard on humour is t Garrison Keillor's A Prairie Home Companion Brian Daley's 1981 adaptation of the blockbuster space opera film Star Wars for NPR Playhouse was a notable success Production costs on this serial were mitigated by the support of Lucasfilm which sold the rights to NPR for a nominal 1 fee and by the participation of the BBC in an international co production deal Star Wars was credited with generating a 40 rise in NPR's ratings and quadrupling the network's youth audience overnight Radio adaptations of the sequels followed with The Empire Strikes Back in 1983 and Return of the Jedi in 1996 53 54 Thanks in large part to the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities public radio continued to air a smattering of audio drama until the mid 1980 s From 1986 to 2002 NPR's most consistent producer of radio drama was the idiosyncratic Joe Frank working out of KCR Win Santa Monica The Sci Fi Channel presented an audio drama series Seeing Ear Theatre on its website from 1997 to 2001 Also the dramatic serial It's Your World aired twice daily on the nationally syndicated Tom Joy ner Morning Show from 1994 to 2008 continuing online through 2010 Radio drama remains popular in much of the world though most material is now available through Internet download rather than heard over terrestrial or satellite radio 55 Stations producing radio drama often commission a large number of scripts The relatively low cost of producing a radio play enables them to take chances with works by unknown writers Radio can be a good training ground for beginning drama writers as the words written form a much greater part of the finished product bad lines cannot be obscured with stage craft The BBC's sole surviving radio soap is The Archers on BBC Radio 4 it is with over 18 700 episodes to date 56 the world's longest running such programme Other radio soaps ongoing serials produced by the BBC but no longer on air include In September 2010 Radio New Zealand began airing its first ongoing soap opera You Me Now which won the Best New Drama Award in the 2011 New Zealand Radio Awards On K D VS radio in Davis California there are two radio theatre shows Evening Shadows a horror fantasy show paying tribute to classic old time radio horror and K D VS Radio Theater which commonly features dramas about social and political themes The audio drama format exists side by side with books presented on radio read by actors or by the author In Britain and other countries there is also quite a bit of radio comedy both stand up and sitcom Together these programs provide entertainment where television is either not wanted or would be distracting such as while driving or operating machinery Selected Shorts a long running NPR program broadcast in front of a live audience at Symphony Space in New York originated the driveway moment for over 300 000 people listeners each week during readings of contemporary and classic short stories by well known professional actors 58 The lack of visuals also enable fantastic al settings and effects to be used in radio plays where the cost would be prohibitive for movies or television The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was first produced as radio drama and was not adapted for television until much later when its popularity would ensure an appropriate return for the high cost of the futuristic setting On occasion television series can be revived as radio series For example a long running but no longer popular television series can be continued as a radio series because the reduced production costs make it cost effective with a much smaller audience When an organisation owns both television and radio channels such as the BBC the fact that no royalties have to be paid makes this even more attractive Radio revivals can also use actors reprising their television roles even after decades as they still sound roughly the same Series that have had this treatment include Doctor Who Dad's Army Thunderbirds dubious discuss and The Tomorrow People In 2013 BBC Radio 4 released a radio adaptation of Never whereby Neil Gaiman featuring a cast of well known television and film actors 59 Neil Gaiman has said he was excited about the radio drama adaptation as it allowed the work to be presented with a greater deal of special effects than was possible on television 60 In the United States an adaptation of The Twilight Zone aired to modest success in the 2000 s decade as a syndicated program Regular broadcasts of radio drama in English can be heard on the BBC's Radio 3 Radio 4 and Radio 4 Extra formerly Radio 7 on RT Radio 1 in Ireland andR NZ National in New Zealand The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation produced notable radio plays in Calgary and Toronto in the postwar decades from which many actors and directors proceeded to international careers but abolished its radio drama department in the 1970 s and finally ceased production of radio dramas in 2012 61 BBC Radio 4 in today noted for its radio drama broadcasting hundreds of new one off plays each year in such strands as The Afternoon Play as well as serials and soap operas Radio 4 Extra broadcasts a variety of radio plays from the BBC's vast archives and a few extended versions of Radio 4 programmes The British commercial station One word though broadcasting mostly book readings also transmitted a number of radio plays in instalments before it closed in 2008 In the United States contemporary radio drama can be found on broadcasters including ACB radio produced by the American Council of the Blind on the Sirius XM Book Radio channel from Sirius XM Satellite Radio previously Sonic Theater on XM and occasionally in syndication as with Jim French's production Imagination Theater Several community radio stations carry weekly radio drama programs including K BOO K FAI W MPG W LP P and W FH B A growing number of religious radio stations air daily or weekly programs usually geared to younger audiences such as Focus on the Family's Adventures in Odyssey 1 700 syndicated stations or Pacific Garden Mission ' sUn shackled 1 800 syndicated stations a long running radio drama which is geared to adults The networks sometime sell transcripts of their shows on cassette tapes or CDs or make the shows available for listening or downloading over the Internet Transcription recordings of many pre television shows have been preserved They are collected re recorded on to audio CDs and or MP 3 files and traded by hobbyists today as old time radio programmes Meanwhile veterans such as the late Yuri Raso v sky The National Radio Theater of Chicago and Thomas Lopez ZB S Foundation have gained new listeners on cassettes CDs and downloads In the mid 1980 s the nonprofit L A Theatre Works launched its radio series recorded before live audiences Productions have been broadcast via public radio while also being marketed on compact discs and via download 62 Carl A mari's nationally syndicated radio series Hollywood 360 features four old time radio shows during his four hour weekly broadcasts A mari also broadcasts old time radio shows on The WG N Radio Theatre heard every Saturday night beginning at 22 00 on 720 WG N in Chicago In addition to traditional radio broadcasters modern radio drama also known as audio theatre or audio drama has experienced a revival with a growing number of independent producers who are able to build an audience through Internet distribution 3 While there are few academic programs in the United States that offer training in radio drama production organisations such as the National Audio Theatre Festival teach the craft to new producers The digital age has also resulted in recording styles that differ from the studio recordings of radio drama's Golden Age Not from Space 2003 on XM Satellite Radio was the first national radio play recorded exclusively through the Internet in which the voice actors were all in separate locations Other producers use portable recording equipment to record actors on location rather than in studios 3 Podcasts are a growing distribution format for independent radio drama producers Podcasts provides an alternative to mainstream television and radio which does not necessarily require a pitching process to be made and distributed as these aspects of production can be learned by the creator and which have no restrictions regarding programme length or content 55 In Australia as in most other developed countries from the early years of the medium almost every radio network and station featured drama serials and soap operas as staples of their programming during the so called Golden Years of radio these were hugely popular Many Australian serials and so a pies were copies of American originals e g the popular soap Portia Faces Life or the adventure series Superman which featured future Australian TV star Leonard Tea le in the title role although these were typically locally produced and performed live to air since the technology of the time did not permit high quality pre recording or duplication of programmes for import or export In this period radio drama serials and soap operas provided a fertile training ground and a steady source of employment for many actors and this was particularly important because at this time the Australian theatre scene was in its infancy and opportunities were very limited Many who trained in this medium such as Peter Finch subsequently became prominent both in Australia and overseas It has been noted that the producers of the popular 1960 s Gerry Anderson TV series Thunderbirds were greatly impressed by the versatility of UK based Australian actor Ray Barrett who voiced many roles in Anderson's TV productions Thanks to his early experience on Australian live radio where he often played English and American roles Barrett was considered better than his English counterparts at providing a convincing transatlantic accent and he could perform a wide range of character voices he also impressed the Anderson team with his ability to quickly and easily switch from one voice accent to another without the sound engineers ' having to stop the recording 63 The effect of the introduction of television there in the late 1950 s had the same devastating effects as it did in the US and many other markets and by the early 1960 s Australian commercial radio had totally abandoned radio drama and related programming including comedy so a pies and variety in favour of music based formats such a sTop 40 or talk radio talk back and the once flourishing Australia radio production industry vanished within a few years One of the few companies to survive was the Melbourne based Crawford Productions which was able to make the successful transition into TV production Despite the complete abandonment of drama and related programming by the commercial radio sector the government funded Australian Broadcasting Corporation ABC maintained a long history of producing radio drama One of its most famous and popular series was the daily 15 minute afternoon soap opera Blue Hills which was written for its entire production history by dramatist Gwen Meredith It featured many well known Australian actresses and actors ran continuously for 27 years from 28 February 1949 to 30 September 1976 with a total of 5 795 episodes broadcast and was at one time the world's longest running radio serial It was preceded by an earlier Meredith serial The Lawson s which featured many of the same themes and characters and itself ran for 1299 episodes In the 1960 s and later the ABC continued to produce many original Australian radio dramas as well as works adapted from other media In recent years original radio dramas and adapted works were commissioned from local dramatists and produced for the ABC's Radio National network program Airplay which ran from the late 1990 s until early 2013 In late 2012 ABC management imposed budget cuts and axed a number of long running arts programs there by ending the national broadcaster's decades long history of producing radio drama as well as its equally long history of providing daily serial is ed book readings Since around the early sixties the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation RIK features radio plays in the Cypriot Greek dialect They are called Cypriot radio drama sketches and they are mainly about Cyprus's rural life traditions and customs its history and its culture and it continues until today Also very popular in Cyprus during the sixties seventies and early eighties Police drama was very popular The series Police Adventures became associated with the name of Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation Cy BC radio producer Miki s Nikita s who was responsible for its production for many years The Police Adventures series also attracted the interest of foreign radio stations as a number of its episodes were sold to Bavarian Radio in 1970 according to information cited in an annual Cy BC report The oldest part of Cy BC's Radio Theater was Theater by Radio which was broadcast on Monday evenings Also broadcasting theatrical plays mainly by classical Greek and Cypriot playwrights as well as works by contemporary Cypriot writers selected through an annual competition along with classic foreign repertoire This tradition has been in place since 1953 the year RIK was established The works are written by established writers but also from new writers through the Writing Contest of Cypriot Sketches issued annually by Cy BC RIK 64 Currently Cypriot sketches are broadcast every Sunday and have a mostly comedic character s at i rising current events they also include comedic song parodies Cy BC has also made other types of radio dramas such as crime stories in the 2010 s which are available online In Finland radio dramas in Finnish ku unn elm a by the Finnish national broadcasting company Yle is radio have been popular since 1930 s and have always used well known theatre or movie actors The dramas include books converted to audio dramas versions of popular theatre productions pulp novels adapted for radio or drama explicitly written as radio dramas One of the most well known series was Suomi sen per he the Family Suomi nen about a middle class family it became so popular that later the originally written for radio drama was converted into a movie series Popular radio drama from other countries like the BBC radio drama The Men from the Ministry was translated as K nalli j a sateen var jo Bowler hat and umbrella and became very popular J R R Tolkien's The Hobbit was converted to multi part radio drama The first German radio drama was produced in

Naka 69 70 71 This resulted in the NHK hiring famous writers to write radio drama scripts for 500 yen in 1930 equivalent to 1 million yen today 72 Due to voice acting in Japan having its own distinct culture audio dramas continue to be popular in Japan where they are now primarily released on disc as drama CDs CD They are also referred to in Japanese as voice dramas Many such audio dramas are based on anime manga novels and video games but there are also many that are completely original 73 Though most drama CDs are commercial products made by corporate entities there has been a growing number of dou j in audio dramas in recent years due to it being easier for hobbyists to obtain the equipment required to make recordings and the Internet making distribution easier Radio teatre t Radio drama in Norway has existed since 1926 74 In Poland radio dramas are sometimes called the theatre of the imagination Polish tea tr w yo bra ni The first Polish radio drama Wars za wi anka based

on literature are also popular in Poland this is how the sound adaptations of George R R Martin's A Game of Thrones Mario Pu zo's The Godfather Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth or Robert Kirk

the greatest Romanian actors of the time Radio broadcasting began in South Africa in 1924 and remained the dominant broadcast medium in the country until the late 1970 s Created by an act of Parliament in 1936 the South African Broadcasting Corporation SABC aired radio dramas along with news and British content in Afrikaans and English Radio drama became more prominent with the launch of Springbok Radio an English and Afrikaans commercial station operated by SABC between May 1950 and December 1985 The SABC launched Radio Bantu in 1960 s broadcasting first in isiZulu and soon followed by other African languages intended to serve as the apartheid state's propaganda channel However radio drama broadcast in African languages contributed to subverting the apartheid government by shaping culture and identity while challenging apartheid ideologies Radio dramas were not subjected to the same level of apartheid editorial scrutiny and therefore provided a forum for ideas without
