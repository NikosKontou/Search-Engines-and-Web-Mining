someone to take care of him leads them to the family of the man who was assaulted who gladly agree to take care of Arp on When the group reaches the forest around the mountain they encounter Baro aba whom they manage to defeat when Pai fu learns to whistle the monster's weakness When Baro aba realizes that they are going to see the witch he helps them reach her house Before entering they are greeted by the witch's servant an on i named Leonardo who grants them entry only after they answer a riddle The group retrieves the medicine and begins their descent down the mountain during which Maru yama accidentally slips and falls Pai fu narrowly saves his life by learning to fly On the way back Maru yama is disappointed to learn that Pai fu lied about the monetary reward but decides that Pai fu's rescue was sufficient compensation The group's return is heralded with a party but Maru yama leaves claiming not to enjoy such activities Pai fu takes the opportunity to explain to everyone what has happened and together they manage to fix an old ghost ship to present to Maru yama fulfilling his wish to obtain one with the promised money Cow a has its origins in Bu bul of Demon Village BU BUL Maj in Mura no Bu buru a one shot Akira Toriyama drew for the revived Jump Readers ' Cup competition in 1997 6 Toriyama who had done only a few one shots since finishing Dragon Ball in 1995 won handily it was his first win since Pola Roid took the top spot in 1981 After winning Toriyama said he was thinking of creating a more developed form of Bu bul of Demon Village 6 He re tooled the character designs and setting of the one shot to suit a new series as detailed in the issue before Cow a 's start citation needed Despite previously claiming to be done with weekly serials Toriyama decided to draw Cow a when he learned his editor would be Kazuhiko Torishima and that he could do things his own way 7 Unlike both Dr Slump and Dragon Ball where he never skipped an issue he drew Cow a in a three weeks on one week off pattern which afforded him time to rest and work more slowly Toriyama stated he wanted to draw everything himself for going the customary use of an assistant even though he had pain in his arm 7 The story came about from wanting to take a storybook type approach and have the main character be an un lovable grumpy guy 7 Written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama Cow a was serialized in Weekly Sh nen Jump magazine from issue 48 of 1997 to 15 of 1998 The fourteen chapters were collected into one tank bon volume that was released on May 1 1998 by Shueisha 8 Viz Media licensed Cow a for English release in North America on July 1 2008 9 Their graphic novel edition retained the first chapter in color 1 It has also been released in other countries such as in France by Glen at Spain by Planet a De Agostini South Korea by Dae won C I and Malaysia Comics House About com's Deb Aoki listed Cow a as the Best New All Ages Manga of 2008 calling it clever and charming enough to entertain adults as well as younger readers 10 Anime News Network's Carl Kimlinger disagreed claiming the plot is not complex enough to appeal to adults He also wished Viz would have kept the other few chapters that were originally colored as such instead of just the first as those particular ones were hard to follow in black and white However he wrote that Mako lee n's character elevates what might have been a simple children's adventure to a gentle fable about acceptance and understanding and praised the humor 1 A E Sparrow of IGN gave the series an 8 6 out of 10 and referred to it as a self contained mini epic On the humor he said the jokes come at you un apologetically and you're either going to catch them or write them off 11 Viz Media's English release of Cow a was nominated for the Eisner Award for Best Publication for Kids in 2009 12",
