chapters 1 One shots date back to the early 19 th century published in newspapers and today may be in the form of single published comic books parts of comic magazines anthologies or published online on websites 2 In the marketing industry some one shots are used as promotion tools that tie in with existing productions films video games or television shows 1 In the Japanese manga industry one shots are called yomi kiri a term which implies that the comic is presented in its entirety without any continuation 3 better source needed One shot manga are often written for contests and sometimes later developed into a full length series much like a television pilot Many popular manga series began as one shots such as Dragon Ball Fist of the North Star Sailor Moon whose one shot would become its sister series Codename Sailor V Naruto Bleach One Piece Berserk Kinn i kum an Attack on Titan and Death Note Rising Stars of Manga was an annual competition for original English language one shot manga many of which have gone on to become full length manga series Some noted manga authors such as Akira Toriyama and Rumiko Takahashi have worked on numerous one shot stories in addition to their serialized works In the United States one shots are usually labeled with a 1 despite there being no following issues and are sometimes subtitled as specials On occasion a character or concept will appear in a series of one shots in cases where the subject matter is not financially lucrative enough to merit an ongoing or limited series but still popular enough to be published on a regular basis often annually or quarterly 1 A current example of a series of one shots would be Marvel Comics ' Franklin Richards Son of a Genius publications This type of one shot is not to be confused with a comic book annual which is typically a companion publication to an established ongoing series The term has also been borrowed into the Franco Belgian comics industry with basically the same meaning although there it mostly refers to comic albums 4 The comic art histories of different countries and regions are following divergent paths Japanese early comic art or manga took its rise from the 12 th century and developed from Ch j j in butsu giga Animal person Caricatures went so far as to ukiyo e floating world in the 17 th century 2 5 Western style humour comics and caricatures had been introduced into Japan in the late 19 th century and impacted on the styles of comic art On the other hand the significant development of modern era Japanese comic art was arising in the aftermath of World War II and further developed into diversified genres 2 Nowadays almost a quarter of all printed materials in Japan are in forms of manga while the audiences are from all ages 6 Most modern era one shot manga yomi kiri have independent settings characters and storylines rather than sharing them with existing works In Japan and other Asian countries some one shot manga are more like takeoff boards to determine the popularity among the audience The format of a one shot manga could be changed if it has a broad market prospect 1 so that The prototype comic works in Western countries were pamphlets giveaways or Sunday newspaper comic sections in the 19 th century These were then developed and published as comic magazines which were distributed with the newspapers sales on newsstands 2 On the other hand graphic books in America were also viewed as developing from pamphlets that sold on newsstands 2 Comics were not highly regarded in the early market for example during the Depression comics were used to increase the sales of newspapers and some other products in the United States Most of the comics were one shot comics before the rise of long conti nui ties in newspaper strips 2 After some early developments weekly comic magazines became the major way of dissemination in European comic markets 2 Influenced by the chaos of social revolutions and changing s in the 20 th century Western alternative comic art was quickly developed as well as 1970 s and 1980 s ' America 7 Also America has stirred up a spree of superhero comics since 1930 s and this comic form is still dominating the comic market In this period comic strips and magazines were the major reading formats that had been leading the markets Divergent genres such as humour caricature and horror were dominant forms of comics in that time In the very beginning magazines were divided from the comic supplements of newspapers within a decade of their first appearance in America 8 On the other side of the coin in Europe magazine format was developed as a comic supplement of newspapers along European features and never lost the identification 2 It is worth mentioning that comic art is developing more rapidly during social revolutions while comic strips were very topical and aimed at all ages Since the 1930 s a specific form of comic the superhero comic has been causing a feeding frenzy in America and further impacted on other countries ' comic markets It dominated the publishing industry on comic art and most of the published comic books were contained one shot stories rather than serialized stories 2 A single popular protagonist always centered all the highlights in a superhero comic story This best selling model is still the majority of American comic market 2 Around the late 1960 s mid 1970 s due to the dislocations of social developments alternative comic art traditions were developing under the era This alternative underground co mix movement used the medium as a method for radical changes 2 In more recent years European albums are still the dominant comic format in their own markets while superhero comic books dominate the American market rather than continued stories Several large comic book publishers Entertainments and animation production companies were established such as DC Comics and Marvel Comics On another note Japanese comics are increasing in popularity as Japanese style anthologies are published in America in recent decades 2",
