    "transformers_text": "A subsidiary subsidiary company or daughter company 1 2 is a company completely or partially owned or controlled by another company called the parent company or holding company which has legal and financial control over the subsidiary company 3 4 Unlike regional branches or divisions subsidiaries are considered to be distinct entities from their parent companies they are required to follow the laws of where they are incorporated and they maintain their own executive leadership Two or more subsidiaries primarily controlled by the same entity group are considered to be sister companies of each other Subsidiaries are a common feature of modern business and most multinational corporations organize their operations via the creation and purchase of subsidiary companies 5 Examples of holding companies are Berkshire Hathaway 6 Jefferies Financial Group The Walt Disney Company Warner Bros Discovery and Citigroup which have subsidiaries involved in many different fields More focused companies include IBM Xerox and Microsoft they and their subsidiaries primarily operate within the tech sector These and others organize their businesses into national and functional subsidiaries often with multiple levels of subsidiaries Subsidiaries are separate distinct legal entities for the purposes of taxation regulation and liability For this reason they differ from divisions which are businesses fully integrated within the main company and not legally or otherwise distinct from it 7 In other words a subsidiary can sue and be sued separately from its parent and its obligations will not normally be the obligations of its parent However creditors of an insolvent subsidiary may be able to obtain a judgment against the parent if they can pierce the corporate veil and prove that the parent and subsidiary are mere alter egos of one another Thus any copyrights trademarks and patents remain with the subsidiary until the parent shuts down the subsidiary Ownership of a subsidiary is usually achieved by owning a majority of its shares This gives the parent the necessary votes to elect their nominees as directors of the subsidiary and so exercise control This gives rise to the common presumption that 50 plus one share is enough to create a subsidiary There are however other ways that control can come about and the exact rules both as to what control is needed and how it is achieved can be complex see below A subsidiary may itself have subsidiaries and these in turn may have subsidiaries of their own A parent and all its subsidiaries together are called a corporate although this term can also apply to cooperating companies and their subsidiaries with varying degrees of shared ownership A parent company does not have to be the larger or more powerful entity it is possible for the parent company to be smaller than a subsidiary such as DanJa q a closely held family company which control sEon Productions the large corporation which manages the James Bond franchise Conversely the parent may be larger than some or all of its subsidiaries if it has more than one as the relationship is defined by control of ownership shares not the number of employees The parent and the subsidiary do not necessarily have to operate in the same locations or operate the same businesses Not only is it possible that they could conceivably be competitors in the marketplace but such arrangements happen frequently at the end of a hostile takeover or voluntary merger Also because a parent company and a subsidiary are separate entities it is entirely possible for one of them to be involved in legal proceedings bankruptcy tax delinquency indictment or under investigation while the other is not 8 In descriptions of larger corporate structures the terms first tier subsidiary second tier subsidiary third tier subsidiary etc describe multiple levels of subsidiaries A first tier subsidiary is a subsidiary child company of the ultimate parent company note 1 9 while a second tier subsidiary is a subsidiary of a first tier subsidiary a grandchild of the main parent company 10 Consequently a third tier subsidiary is a subsidiary of a second tier subsidiary a great grandchild of the main parent company The ownership structure of the small British specialist company Ford Component Sales which sells Ford components to specialist car manufacturers and OEM manufacturers such as Morgan Motor Company and Cater ham Cars 11 illustrates how multiple levels of subsidiaries are used in large corporations The word control and its derivatives subsidiary and parent may have different meanings in different contexts These concepts may have different meanings in various areas of law e g corporate law competition law capital markets law or in accounting For example if Company A purchases shares in Company B it is possible that the transaction is not subject to merger control because Company A had been deemed to already control Company B before the share purchase under competition law rules but at the same time Company A may be required to start consolidating Company B into its financial statements under the relevant accounting rules because it had been treated as a joint venture before the purchase for accounting purposes Control can be direct e g an ultimate parent company controls the first tier subsidiary directly or indirect e g an ultimate parent company controls second and lower tiers of subsidiaries indirectly through first tier subsidiaries Recital 31 of Directive 2013 34 EU 16 stipulates that control should be based on holding a majority of voting rights but control may also exist where there are agreements with fellow shareholders or members In certain circumstances control may be effectively exercised where the parent holds a minority or none of the shares in the subsidiary According to Article 22 of the directive 2013 34 EU an undertaking is a parent if it Additionally control may arise when Under the international accounting standards adopted by the EU 17 a company is deemed to control another company only if it has all the following A subsidiary can have only one parent otherwise the subsidiary is in fact a joint arrangement joint operation or joint venture over which two or more parties have joint control I FRS 11 para 4 Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control The Companies Act 2006 contains two definitions one of subsidiary and the other subsidiary undertaking According to s 1159 of the Act a company is a subsidiary of another company its holding company if that other company The second definition is broader According to s 1162 of the Companies Act 2006 an undertaking is a parent undertaking in relation to another undertaking a subsidiary undertaking if An undertaking is also a parent undertaking in relation to another undertaking a subsidiary undertaking if The broader definition of subsidiary undertaking is applied to the accounting provisions of the Companies Act 2006 while the definition of subsidiary is used for general purposes 18 In Oceania the accounting standards defined the circumstances in which one entity controls another citation needed In doing so they largely abandoned the legal control concepts in favour of a definition that provides that control is the capacity of an entity to dominate decision making directly or indirectly in relation to the financial and operating policies of another entity so as to enable that other entity to operate with it in pursuing the objectives of the controlling entity This definition was adapted in the Australian Corporations Act 2001 s 50 A A 19 Furthermore it can be a useful part of the company that allows every head of the company to apply new projects and latest rules citation needed",
