    "transformers_text": "A guide book or travel guide is a book of information about a place designed for the use of visitors or tourists 1 It will usually include information about sights accommodation restaurants transportation and activities Maps of varying detail and historical and cultural information are often included Different kinds of guide books exist focusing on different aspects of travel from adventure travel to relaxation or aimed at travelers with different in comes or focusing on sexual orientation or types of diet Travel guides or guide books can also take the form of travel websites A forerunner of the guidebook was the peri plus an itinerary from landmark to landmark of the ports along a coast A peri plus such as the Peri plus of the Erythrae an Sea was a manuscript document that listed in order the ports and coastal landmarks with approximate intervening distances that the captain of a vessel could expect to find along a shore This work was possibly written in the middle of the 1 st century CE 2 It served the same purpose as the later Roman it in era rium of road stops The per ie ges is or progress around was an established literary genre during the Hellenistic age A lost work by A gac ly tus describing Olympia is referred to by the Suda and P hot ius 3 4 Dionysius Per ie get es literally Dionysius the Traveller was the author of a description of the habitable world in Greek hexameter verse written in a terse and elegant style intended for the klis mos traveller rather than the actual tourist on the ground he is believed to have worked in Alexandria and to have flourished around the time of Hadrian An early remarkably well informed and interesting guidebook was the Hell a dos Per ie ges is Descriptions of Greece of Pausanias of the 2 nd century A D 5 This most famous work is a guide to the interesting places works of architecture sculpture and curious customs of Ancient Greece and is still useful to Classicists today With the advent of Christianity the guide for the European religious pilgrim became a useful guidebook An early account is that of the pilgrim Egeria who visited the Holy Land in the 4 th century CE and left a detailed itinerary In the medieval Arab world guide books for travelers in search of artifacts and treasures were written by Arabic treasure hunters magicians and alchemists This was particularly the case in Arab Egypt where treasure hunters were eager to find valuable ancient Egyptian antiquities Some of the books claimed to be imbued with magic that could dispel the magical barriers believed to be protecting the artifacts 6 Travel literature became popular during the Song dynasty 960 1279 of medieval China The genre was called ' travel record literature ' you ji wen xue and was often written in narrative prose essay and diary style Travel literature authors such as Fan Cheng da 1126 1193 and Xu Xia ke 1587 1641 incorporated a wealth of geographical and topographical information into their writing while the ' day trip essay ' Record of Stone Bell Mountain by the noted poet and statesman Su Shi 1037 1101 presented a philosophical and moral argument as its central purpose 7 In the West the guidebook developed from the published personal experiences of aristocrats who traveled through Europe on the Grand Tour As the appreciation of art architecture and antiquity became ever more essential ingredients of the noble upbringing so they predominated in the guidebooks particularly those devoted to the Italian peninsula Richard Lasse ls 1603 1668 wrote a series of manuscript guides which were eventually published posthumously in Paris and London 1670 as The Voyage of Italy 8 Grand Tour guidebooks poured off the presses throughout the eighteenth century those such as Patrick B ryd one's A Tour Through Sicily and Malta being read by many who never left England 9 Between 1626 and 1649 the Dutch publisher Of fic in a Elze v irian a House of Elze vi r published a bestselling pocketbook series theRe s public a e Elze v irian a e Elze v irian Republics which has been described as the ancestor of the modern travel guide 10 Each volume gave information geography population economy history on a country in Europe Africa the Near East or the Far East 11 An important transitional figure from the idiosyncratic style of the Grand Tour travelogues to the more informative and impersonal guidebook was Mariana Starke Her 1824 guide to travel in France and Italy served as an essential companion for British travelers to the Continent in the early 19 th century She recognized that with the growing numbers of Britons traveling abroad after 1815 the majority of her readers would now be in family groups and on a budget She therefore included for the first time a wealth of advice on luggage obtaining passports the precise cost of food and accommodation in each city and even advice on the care of invalid family members She also devised a system of exclamation mark ratings a forerunner of today's star ratings Her books published by John Murray served as a template for later guides In the United States the first published guidebook was Gideon Minor Davison's The Fashionable Tour published in 1822 and Theodore Dwight's The Northern Traveller and Henry Gil pin's The Northern Tour both from 1825 12 The modern guidebook emerged in the 1830 s with the burgeoning market for long distance tourism The publisher John Murray began printing the Murray's Handbooks for Travellers in London from 1836 13 The series covered tourist destinations in Europe Asia and northern Africa and he introduced the concept of sights which he rated in terms of their significance using stars for Starke's exclamation points According to scholar James Buz ard the Murray style exemplified the exhaustive rational planning that was as much an ideal of the emerging tourist industry as it was of British commercial and industrial organization generally 14 In Germany Karl Baedeker acquired the publishing house of Franz Friedrich R h ling in Koblenz which in 1828 had published a handbook for travellers by Professor Johannes August Klein entitled Rhein reise von Mainz b is C ln e in Handbuch f r Sch nell reise nde A Rhine Journey from Mainz to Cologne A Handbook for Travellers on the Move He published this book with little changes for the next ten years which provided the seeds for Baedeker's new approach to travel guides After Klein died he decided to publish a new edition in 1839 to which he added many of his own ideas on what he thought a travel guide should offer the traveller Baedeker's ultimate aim was to free the traveller from having to look for information anywhere outside the travel guide whether about routes transport accommodation restaurants tipping sights walks or prices Baedeker emulated the style of John Murray's guidebooks 15 but included unprecedented detailed information In 1846 Baedeker introduced his star ratings for sights attractions and lodgings following Mrs Starke's and Murray's This edition was also his first experimental red guide He also decided to call his travel guides handbooks following the example of John Murray III Baedeker's early guides had tan covers but from 1856 onwards Murray's red bindings and gilt lettering became the familiar hallmark of all Baedeker guides as well and the content became famous for its clarity detail and accuracy 16 Baedeker and Murray produced impersonal objective guides works prior to this combined factual information and personal sentimental reflection 16 The availability of the books by Baedeker and Murray helped sharpen and formalize the complementary genre of the personal travelogue which was freed from the burden of serving as a guide book 16 The Baedeker and Murray guide books were hugely popular and were standard resources for travelers well into the 20 th century As William Wet more Story said in the 1860 s Every Englishman abroad carries a Murray for information and a Byron for sentiment and finds out by them what he is to know and feel by every step After Karl Baedeker died his son also named Karl inherited the Baedeker travel guide business however he was killed in action during World War I British nationalism and anti German sentiment resulted in some British people labeling Baedeker guides instrumental to the German war effort and their popularity in the United Kingdom dropped considerably 17 As a result the two editors of Baedeker's English language titles left the company and acquired the rights to Murray's Handbooks The resulting guide books called the Blue Guides to distinguish them from the red covered Baedeker s constituted one of the major guide book series for much of the 20 th century and are still published today Soon after World War II two new names emerged which combined European and American perspectives on international travel Eugene Fodor a Hungarian born author of travel articles who had emigrated to the United States before the war wrote guidebooks which introduced English reading audiences to continental Europe Arthur Frommer an American soldier stationed in Europe during the Korean War used his experience traveling around the Continent as the basis for Europe on 5 a Day 1957 which introduced readers to options for budget travel in Europe Both authors ' guidebooks became the foundations for extensive series eventually covering destinations around the world Since then Let's Go Lonely Planet Insight Guides Rough Guides Eyewitness Travel Guides and many other travel guide series have been published Specialist climbing guidebooks for mountains have a long history owing to the special needs of mountaineering rock climbing hill walking and scrambling The guides by W A Pouch er for
