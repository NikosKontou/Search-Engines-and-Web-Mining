Zoro first challenged Mihawk to a duel to the death when the latter was hunting the pirate captain Don Krieg at Baratie and lost, though Mihawk deemed that despite not being a worthy opponent for him at that point, Zoro would be able to grow into a worthy competitor given the time and allowed him to live. Mihawk even trained Zoro during the series' two year time jump due to a combination of reasons: he was humored by the concept of training a man who sought to one day kill him and take his title and he respected Zoro's dedication to his craft and his skill and for putting aside his pride so that he could help Luffy and his friends by continuing to hone his skills as a combatant.

While originally the director of MADS (which also consisted of Buckingham Stussy , Caesar Clown , Queen , and Vinsmoke Judge ) before the group was arrested, Vegapunk was brought into the Marines as its head scientist.\n\nSome of Vegapunk's achievements when working for the Marines have included but are not limited to using seastones on the hulls of ships to keep the Sea Kings away, researching the Lineage Factor, creating artificial lifeforms, doing gigantification research, figuring out how to make an inanimate object \"eat\" a Devil Fruit, doing cyborg modifications to people, working on warping technology, and a Den Den Mushi that can broadcast anything across the world.\n\nVegapunk originally had an enlarged head the size of a giant as a side effect of eating the Brain-Brain Fruit, which enabled him to absorb and store information. He would later split his brain and place them into his Punk Records. Vegapunk later created some satellites who assist in his research like the Seraphim Project.\n\nAt some point in the past, he had an encounter with Professor Clou D. Clover and learned about the people who had D in their name. Four years later, Vegapunk was saddened when Clover was killed in the destruction of Ohara. Around the time Egghead was constructed, he became good friends with Borsalino , Bartholomew Kuma , his adoptive daughter Jewelry Bonney and Sentomaru . Vegapunk gradually turned Kuma into a mindless cyborg in exchange for Bonney's medical treatment. Unbeknownst to the World Government, he had tampered with this experiment for the duo's benefit.\n\nVegapunk was first seen on Egghead when the Straw Hat Pirates briefly visited the island. It was through him that they learned the true name of Monkey D. Luffy's Devil Fruit. When the Navy attacked Egghead to assassinate him after York's betrayal, Borsalino killed him in spite of his personal feelings and he died in Sanji's arms. It was claimed that Vegapunk's brain in the Punk Records would continue to live on. Vegapunk's death led to the worldwide broadcast of a pre-recorded video revealing Vegapunk's research on the Void Century.\n\nThere is also a functional clone of Vegapunk being brought to Elbaph as part of a meticulous contingency plan.\n\nDr. Vegapunk is voiced by Yoshito Yasuhara in episode 610 in the original Japanese version and Yōhei Tadano in later episodes of the original Japanese version.

In addition, he is shown to have control over the Pacifista units. Following the time skip, Sentomaru became a full-fledged Marine officer.\n\nDuring the \"Egghead Arc\", Sentomaru helped out the Straw Hat Pirates in their mission to rescue Vegapunk from York out of loyalty to Vegapunk. He was briefly captured by the Marines. After the Straw Hat Pirates escape from Egghead, Sentomaru escapes from Marines custody and leaves Egghead on a rowboat with supplies while shedding tears.\n\nSentomaru is voiced by Kazue Ikura in the original Japanese version and by Greg Ayres in the Funimation dub.\n\nStussy ( ステューシー , Sutyūshī ) is an elegant woman who is a clone of Buckingham Stussy developed by MADS who is employed as a spy by Dr. Vegapunk. [ ch. 1072 ] She remained loyal to Vegapunk and has been working as a deep undercover agent of the World Government for 27 years, infiltrating CP0 and becoming one of its masked agents. [ ch. 871 ] Stussy also posed and operated as an emperor of the Underworld under the nickname of the \"Queen of the Pleasure District\" ( 歓楽街の女王 , Kanraku-gai no Joō ) . [ ch. 860 ] It was also revealed that Stussy ate an unidentified Bat-Bat Fruit model that enables her to turn into a bat or a bat-human hybrid with blood-sucking abilities. [ ch. 1072 ]\n\nStussy is voiced by Mami Kingetsu in the original Japanese version and by Anastasia Muñoz in the Funimation dub.\n\nThe Seraphim ( セラフィム , Serafimu ) are Pacifistas created by Dr. Vegapunk for the Navy. Each of them is a cyborg clone of a known member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea who resemble their child appearances, are spliced with King's Lunarian Lineage Factor that grants them Lunarian abilities, and have the Green Blood which enables them to copy the powers of a Devil Fruit. When CP0 infiltrated Egghead, they took control of the Seraphim to target their creator and his satellites. Though York later took over them after capturing Vegapunk and the CP0 agents.\n\nThere are also some unnamed Seraphim who are clones of Sir Crocodile , Gecko Moria , and Donquixote Doflamingo .\n\nEmet ( エメト , Emeto ) the Iron Giant ( 鉄の巨人 , Tetsu no Kyojin ) is a legendary gigantic robot who was created 900 years ago before running out of power and being rendered inert on Egghead. During Luffy's fight with the Marines and the Five Elders, Emet reactivates upon hearing Luffy's Drums of Liberation and helps battle the Marines.\n\nEmet is voiced by Naomi Kusumi in the original Japanese version.\n\nThe following are known inhabitants of Egghead with some of them being created by Dr. Vegapunk and his Satellites:\n\nElbaph ( エルバフ , Erubafu ) is a mountainous island that is inhabited by giants and has a colossal tree called Treasure Tree Adam that dwarfs all of Elbaph. The lower regions are snow-coated mountains and has been classified as the \"Underworld\". The upper regions are on the tree and has been classified as the \"Sun World\". The highest level is classified as the \"Astral World\". Travel to either of the levels requires the use of an artificial rainbow done by a tool called a Painter (also called a Sunstone). It is ruled under the Warland Kingdom, with its leader currently vacant after Harald's death.\n\nBesides the Giant Warrior Pirates , the New Giant Warrior Pirates , and John Giant , the following reside in Elbaph.\n\nHarald ( ハラルド , Hararudo ) is the former King of Elbaph and the father of Loki and Hajrudin . A childhood friend of Dorry and Brogy , he is a spoilt and extremely violent man whose strength and iron-fist rule led to him becoming a feared figure around the world. However, a chance meeting with foreign giant Ida (with whom he sired Hajrudin) motivated him to turn over a new leaf, becoming a honorable person and prioritizing the country's development on education and diplomacy. Due to his responsibilities, he neglected his sons' needs, leading to Loki's constant abuse by his family, though Hajrudin was not affected. At different points, Harald had declined the invitation of Rocks D. Xebec to join the Rocks Pirates in his plan of world domination. After witnessing Rocks' death during the God Valley Incident, he destroys his horns and chooses to serve the World Government as a Devoted Blade, defeating pirates in exchange for Elbaph's pending membership. He is killed by his soldiers under mysterious circumstances which was blamed on Loki who was thought to be targeting the Devil Fruit that he was guarding.\n\nLoki ( ロキ , Roki ) is a very large giant with a demonic-looking appearance who is the son of King Harald, the Prince of Elbaph, and the half-brother of Hajrudin .\n\nBorn to Harald and Estrid, he was thrown into the Underworld by his mother due to his demonic eyes, only to climb his way back to the palace by himself. He met Rocks D. Xebec when attempting suicide and failed to persuade Xebec to let him join up with the Rocks Pirates. When Rocks D. Xebec died at God Valley, Loki mourned his death. After Estrid's death from a sickness where Loki having never recovered from her trauma as well as beating up the giant who poisoned Ida who he claimed to be a better mother, he was blamed by the public for any grievances on Elbaph, be it natural disasters or deaths of any cause. Despite Harald's love, his non-presence and further abuse by family led to Loki growing into a lonely and violent yet fundamentally misunderstood individual. He is abused and ostracized by Hajrudin and the other children due to his apparent threat and reckless acts, though his strength allows him to defeat and bully Hajrudin for his illegitimacy. He was a dedicated fan of Rocks D. Xebec, having first met him as an infant, until he was beat to near-death for attempting to join the Rocks Pirates. Despite her illegitimacy, he considers Hajrudin's mother Ida to be his own, massacring a village for poisoning her to death.\n\nAt one point in his life, Loki was to have an arranged marriage with Charlotte Lola, spitefully arranged by Elbaph elders and Big Mom due to the latter and Loki's poor reputation in Elbaph. After Charlotte Lola fled the scene, Big Mom tried to use Charlotte Chiffon as a substitute which only made things worse between Big Mom and the giants. He took the blame for Harald's death, sabotaging an unknown actor in the process while gaining the ire of the Figarland siblings, with Shanks trapping him in the Underworld and Shamrock assaulting him for refusing orders to join the God's Knights. He was found by Monkey D. Luffy in the Underworld, bartering a deal for his freedom in exchange for news about Shanks, only to be interrupted by the intervention of the New Giant Warrior Pirates and the God's Knights. After Loki was injured by the God's Knights and had to be healed by the Straw Hat Pirates, Loki claimed to Hajrudin that he didn't kill their father over the Devil Fruit that he was guarding.\n\nJaguar D. Saul ( ハグワール・D・サウロ , Haguwāru Dī Sauro ) is a giant and former Vice Admiral.\n\nAfter arriving on Ohara after he deserted the Marines.
