opponents and dissidents Secret police organizations are characteristic of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes 4 They protect the political power of a dictator or regime and often operate outside the law to repress dissidents and weaken political opposition frequently using violence 5 They may enjoy legal sanction to hold and charge suspects without ever identifying their organization Egypt is home to Africa and the Middle East's first internal security service The State Security Investigations Service Initially it was formed during the British occupation of Egypt as the Intelligence wing of the regular police After the 1952 coup the State Security apparatus was reformed and reorganized to suit the security concerns of the new socialist regime of Gamal Abdel Nasser The S S IS was made a separate branch of the Ministry of Interior and separated from the regular police command During the Nasser era It was intensively trained by the Soviet KGB on coercive interrogation techniques mass surveillance public intimidation and political suppression The S S IS was responsible for suppressing opposition groups to Nasser and his successors Sadat and Mubarak Torture was a systematic practice by that repressive apparatus During the war on terror The S S IS used to receive suspected terrorists that were sent to Egypt from the United States and used to interrogate them using torture After the 2011 revolution demonstrators demanded that the service be dissolved and several buildings including the headquarters in Nasr City were stormed by protesters that gathered evidence of torture tools secret cells and documents showing surveillance on citizens On March 15 2011 Egypt's Minister of Interior announced the dissolution of the State Security and declared the new National Security Agency would replace it and be responsible for its internal security and counter terrorist duties From 1974 to 1987 Ethiopia was ruled by a communist military junta known as the Der g in 1987 the country formally reformed into a presidential republic but the same people remained in power until May 1991 The Der g built a police state with a brutal military government The brutality of its regime was particularly evident in the 1976 1978 during military campaign called Red Terror against perceived opponents To exercise total control over the country the Der g needed a secret police And it formed one in August 1978 it became known as the Central Revolutionary Investigation Department C RID C RID was responsible for suppressing dissent and identifying targets for state repression in Ethiopia Department also has been monitoring opposition in government controlled areas and regime dissidents C RID is considered to be the most advanced institution of violence in Der g's Ethiopia 6 In Uganda the State Research Bureau S RB was a secret police organisation for President Idi Amin The Bureau tortured many Ugandan s operating on behalf of a regime responsible for more than five hundred thousand violent deaths 7 8 The S RB attempted to infiltrate every area of Ugandan life 9 In Zimbabwe the Central Intelligence Organisation CIO was the secret police of President Robert Mugabe who is responsible for detaining torturing mass beating raping and starving thousands of civilians on the orders of Mugabe In East Asia the Embroidered Uniform Guard Chinese pinyin J ny w i of the Ming dynasty was founded in the 1360 s by the Hongwu Emperor and served as the dynasty's secret police until the collapse of Ming rule in 1644 Originally their main functions were to serve as the emperor's bodyguard and to spy on his subjects and report any plots of rebellion or regicide directly to the emperor Over time the organization took on law enforcement and judicial functions and grew to be immensely powerful with the power to overrule ordinary judicial rulings and to investigate interrogate and punish anyone including members of the imperial family In 1420 a second secret police organization run by eunuchs known as the Eastern Depot D ng Ch ng was formed to suppress suspected political opposition to the usurpation of the throne by the Yongle Emperor Combined these two organizations made the Ming dynasty one of the world's first police states 10 The Ministry of State Security Gu ji n qu n B in modern China controls a network of provincial and local State Security Bureaus integrated with local Public Security Bureaus which make up part of the policing system of China The MS S has its own branch of the People's Police known as the State Security Police with officers which have the dual tasks of law enforcement and repressing political dissent 11 State security bureaus and public security bureaus are functionally co located within the same buildings as each other 12 The MS S and the Ministry of Public Security control the overall national police network of China and the two agencies share resources and closely coordinate with each other 13 better source needed In British Hong Kong the Special Branch was established in 1934 originally as an anti communist squad under MI 5 with assistance from MI 6 14 The branch later joined the Crime Department of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force in 1946 and focused on preventing pro KMT rightists and pro CCP leftists from infiltrating the colony 15 The National Security Department in the current HK SARis a secret police agency created after the enactment of the Hong Kong National Security Law 16 The NS D has accused and arrested dissenting voices in Hong Kong for endangering the national security including pro democracy politicians protestors and journalists 17 18 Some websites were also reportedly banned by the department including Hong Kong Watch 19 In the Middle East located in Baghdad S hurt a was one of the most both powerful intelligence and secret police organizations of the Abbasid era which was led by the Abbasids in the 8 th and 9 th centuries during the Golden Age of Islam In Japan the Kempe itai existed from 1881 to 1945 and were described as secret police by the Australian War Memorial 20 21 It had an equivalent branch in the Imperial Japanese Navy known as the Tok keitai However their civilian counterpart known as the Tokk was formed in 1911 Its task consisted of controlling political groups and ideologies in Imperial Japan resembling closer the other secret police agencies of the time period For this it earned the nickname the Thought Police 22 23 The Korean Central Intelligence Agency or KCIA is a secret police agency which acted extra judicially and was involved in such activities as kidnapping a presidential candidate and the assassination of Park Chung hee among other things 24 25 The General Intelligence Directorate or the GID was the secret police organization of the Assad regime which ruled Syria that suppressed the people until it disbanded in December 2024 during the Syrian Revolution with a popular uprising against the dictator Bashar al Assad when he fled to Russia that night In Taiwan the National Security Bureau established in 1954 is the regime's main intelligence agency The Taiwan Garrison Command acted as a secret police national security body which existed as a branch of the Republic of China Armed Forces The agency was established at the end of World War II and operated throughout the Cold War It was disbanded on 1 August 1992 It was responsible for suppressing activities viewed as promoting democracy and Taiwan independence The institutional is ation of state secret security services began in the 16 th century with greater professional is ation bureaucrat is ation and special is ation of state security as intensified competition between states drove governments to maximise their control of resources The Inquisition served as a model for many such state agencies 26 Secret police organizations originated in 18 th century Europe after the French Revolution and the Congress of Vienna Such operations were established in an effort to detect any possible conspiracies or revolutionary subversion The peak of secret police operations in most of Europe was 1815 to 1860 when restrictions on voting assembly association unions and the press were so severe in most European countries that opposition groups were forced into conspiratorial activities 27 The Geheime Staatspolizei of Austria and the Ge heim polizei of Prussia were particularly notorious during this period 28 27 After 1860 the use of secret police declined due to increasing liberalization except in autocratic regimes such as Tsarist Russia 27 In Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945 the Geheime Staatspolizei Secret State Police Gestapo and Geheime Fe ld polizei Secret Field Police GF P were a secret police organization used to identify and eliminate opposition including suspected organized resistance Its claimed main duty according to a 1936 law was to investigate and suppress all anti State tendencies 29 One method used to spy on citizens was to intercept letters or telephone calls They encouraged ordinary Germans to in form on each other 30 As part of the Reich Security Main Office it was also a key organizer of the Holocaust Although the Gestapo had a relatively small number of personnel 32 000 in 1944 it maximized these small resources through informants and a large number of denunciations from the local population 31 After the defeat of the Nazis in World War II Germany was split into West and East Germany East Germany became a socialist state and was ruled by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany which was closely aligned with the Soviet Union and the rest of the Eastern Bloc Its secret police organization the Ministry for State Security Minister i um f r Staat sicherheit commonly referred to as the Stasi made use of an extensive network of civilian informers 32 From the 1970's the main form of political cultural and religious repression practiced by the Stasi was a form of silent repression 33 called Z er set zun g Decomposition This involved the sustained use of covert psychological harassment methods against people which were designed to cause mental and emotional health problems and there by debilitate them and cause them to become socially isolated 34 Directed energy weapons are considered by some survivors and analysts to have also been used as a constituent part of Z er set zun g methods although this is not definitely proven 35 The House of Terror museum in Budapest displays the headquarters for the Arrow Cross Party which killed hundreds of Jews in its basement among other targets considered enemies of the race based state 36 The same building was used by the State Protection Authority or VH secret police The Soviet aligned VH moved into the former fascist police headquarters and used it to torture and execute state opponents 37 In fascist Italy 1922 1943 and the Italian Social Republic RSI OV RA were a fascist Italian secret police organization The PIDE was the Portuguese security agency and secret police that existed from 1933 to 1969 during the Estado Novo regime of Ant nio de Oliveira Salazar In 1969 the name was changed to Directorate General of Security It was dissolved with the Carnation Revolution in 1974 Ivan the Terrible implemented Op rich nina in Russia between 1565 and 1572 In the Russian Empire the secret police forces were the Third Section of the Imperial Chancery and then the Ok h rana Agents of the Ok h rana were vital in identifying and suppressing opponents of the Tsar The Ok h rana engaged in torture and infiltration of opponents 38 They infiltrated labor unions political parties and newspapers 39 After the Russian Revolution the Soviet Union established the Cheka O GPU NKVD N KGB and MVD 40 Cheka as an authorized secret police force under the rule of the Bolsheviks suppressed political opponents during the Red Terror It also enacted counterintelligence operations such as Operation Trust in which it set up a fake anti Bolshevik organization to identify opponents It was the temporary forerunner to the KGB a later secret police agency used for similar purposes 41 The NKVD participated in the Great Purge under Stalin 42 In Cuba President Fulgencio Batista's secret police known as the Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities or BRAC suppressed political opponents such as the 26 th of July Movement through methods including violent interrogations 43 44 Under the Communist Party of Cuba the Ministry of the Interior has served a number of secret policing functions As recently as 1999 the Human Rights Watch reported that repression of dissidents was routine albeit harsher after heightened periods of opposition activity 45 The Bureau of Democracy Human Rights and Labor under the US State Department reported that Cuba's Ministry of the Interior utilizes a network of informants known as the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution or CDR to monitor government opponents 46 Secret state police have operated in secret among CDR groups and most adult Cubans are officially members CDR are tasked with informing on other Cubans and monitoring activity in their neighborhoods 47 During the Truman Doctrine Mexican president Miguel Alem n Vald s created DF S to combat communist opposition The agency was later replaced by D IS EN in 1985 after DF S agents were working for the Guadalajara Cartel In 1989 it was replaced by C IS EN In Mississippi the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission or Sov Com was a state agency given unusual authority by the governor of Mississippi from 1956 to 1977 to investigate and police private citizens in order to uphold racial segregation This authority was used to suppress and spy on the activities of civil rights workers along with others suspected of sentiments contrary to white supremacy 48 Agents from the Sov Com wiretapped and bugged citizens of Mississippi and historians identify the agency as a secret police force 49 50 51 Among other things the Sov Com collaborated with the Ku Klux Klan and engaged injury tampering to harass targets 52 53 The agency ceased to function in 1973 but was not officially dissolved until 1977 54 55 The Sov Com served as a model for the Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission the Florida Legislative Investigation Committee and the Alabama State Sovereignty Commission In private writings in 1945 President Harry S Truman wrote that the Federal Bureau of Investigation under Director J Edgar Hoover was tending towards becoming a secret police force We want no Gestapo or Secret Police F B I is tending in that direction They are dabbling in sex life s candles sic and plain blackmail when they should be catching criminals They also have a habit of sneering at local law enforcement officers 56 57 58 Beginning a decade later in 1956 Hoover's FBI began the CO INTEL PRO project aimed at suppressing domestic political opponents 59 60 Among other targets this included Martin Luther King Jr 61 Some have also likened the U S Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE under the second presidency of Donald Trump to a modern day Gestapo over their indiscriminate abductions and detainment of suspected illegal immigrants and activists who had participated in pro Palestinian demonstrations on university campuses without due process 62 Such language has also been characterized as sickening by the United States Department of Homeland Security who criticized Minnesota Governor Tim Walz for making such comparisons 63 During the Get lio Vargas dictatorship between 1930 and 1946 the Department of Political and Social Order DO PS was the government's secret police 64 During the military dictatorship in Brazil DO PS was employed by the military regime along with the Department of Information Operations Center for Internal Defense Operations or DOI COD I and the National Intelligence Service or SNI and engaged in kidnappings torture and attacks against theaters and bookstores 65 The National Intelligence Directorate or DINA was a powerful secret police agency under the rule of Augusto Pinochet which was charged with killings and torture related to repression of political opponents 66 Chilean government investigations found that over 30 000 people were tortured by the agency 67 During the dictatorship of Marcos P rez Jim nez theSe guri dad Nacional secret police investigated arrested tortured and assassinated political opponents to the Venezuelan government 68 69 From 1951 until 1953 it operated a prison camp on Guas in a Island es which was effectively a forced labour camp 68 The Se guri dad Nacional was abolished following the overthrow of P rez Jim nez on 23 January 1958 68 70 During the crisis in Venezuela and Venezuelan protests Vice President sTar eck El A is sami and Del cy Rodr guez have been accused of using SEB INto oppress political demonstrations SEB IN director and general Manuel Cristo p her Fig u era reported that SEB IN would torture political demonstrators during interrogation sessions 71 Ilan Berman and J Michael Waller describe the secret police as central to totalitarian regimes and an indispensable device for the consolidation of power neutralization of the opposition and construction of a single party state 3 In addition to these activities secret police may also be responsible for tasks not related to suppressing internal dissent such as gathering foreign intelligence engaging in counterintelligence organizing border security and guarding government buildings and officials 3 Secret police forces sometimes endure even after the fall of a totalitarian regime 3 Arbitrary detention abduction and forced disappearance torture and assassination are all tools wielded by secret police to prevent investigate or punish real or imagined opposition 72 Because secret police typically act with great discretionary powers to decide what is a crime and are a tool used to target political opponents they operate outside the rule of law 73 People apprehended by the secret police are often arbitrarily arrested and detained without due process While in detention arrestees may be tortured or subjected to inhumane treatment Suspects may not receive a public trial and instead may be convicted in a kangaroo court style show trial or by a secret tribunal Secret police known to have used these approaches in history included the secret police of East Germany the Ministry for State Security or Stasi and Portuguese PIDE 74 A single secret service may pose a potential threat to the central political authority Political scientist Sheena Chestnut Gre it ens writes that When it comes to their security forces autocrats face a fundamental ' coercing dilemma ' between empowerment and control Autocrats must empower their security forces with enough coercing capacity to enforce internal order and conduct external defense Equally important to their survival however they must control that capacity to ensure it is not turned against them 75 Authoritarian regimes therefore attempt to engage in coup proofing designing institutions to minimize risks of a coup Two methods of doing so are",
