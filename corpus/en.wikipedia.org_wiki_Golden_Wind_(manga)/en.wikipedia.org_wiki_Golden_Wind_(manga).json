    "transformers_text": "Golden Wind ( Japanese : 黄金の風 , Hepburn : Ōgon no Kaze ) , also known as Vento Aureo , is the fifth main story arc of the Japanese manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure , written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki . It was serialized in Shueisha 's Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 11, 1995, [ 2 ] to April 5, 1999. [ 3 ] In its original publication, it was referred to as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 5 Giorno Giovanna: Golden Heritage ( ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 第5部 ジョルノ・ジョバァーナ【黄金なる遺産】 , JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken Dai Go Bu Joruno Jobāna [Ōgon naru Isan] ) . Within Golden Wind , the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure title is rendered in Italian, as Le Bizzarre Avventure di GioGio .\n\nTaking place in Italy in the year 2001, the story follows Giorno Giovanna , an illegitimate son of the long-deceased Dio Brando , who aspires to overthrow the boss of the corrupt mafia ruling his hometown of Naples with the aid of a team of fellow Stand users.\n\nAs it is the fifth part of the series, its 155 chapters pick up where the fourth left off and are numbered 440 to 594, with the tankōbon volumes numbered 47 to 63. It was preceded by Diamond Is Unbreakable and followed by Stone Ocean . An anime adaptation by David Production , JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind , aired on TV from October 2018 to July 2019. An English hardcover edition of the manga by Viz Media was published in nine omnibus volumes from August 2021 to August 2023.\n\nIn 2001, Koichi Hirose arrives in Naples to investigate a teenager named Haruno Shiobana, who Jotaro Kujo suspects to be the son of Dio Brando . Koichi soon meets and is scammed by Haruno, now going by the name of Giorno Giovanna , whose Stand, Gold Experience, can create lifeforms and heal injuries. A Stand-wielding mafioso by the name of Bruno Bucciarati , seeks to avenge an injury Giorno inflicted on a member of the Passione organisation. Defeated, he finds himself won over by Giorno's dream of becoming Passione's boss in order to better Naples and end the scourge of drug trafficking plaguing the city's youth. He agrees to introduce Giorno to visit an imprisoned capo named Polpo who offers an initiation test involving the indirect use of a Stand Arrow , whose blade either inflicts death or a Stand. After convincing Koichi to cease his investigation, Giorno uses his stand to remotely kill Polpo as revenge for an innocent bystander's death.\n\nGiorno is placed in Bucciarati's group, consisting of fellow Stand users Guido Mista, Leone Abbacchio, Narancia Ghirga and Pannacotta Fugo. Polpo's apparent suicide provides an opening for Bucciarati to achieve the rank of capo by donating Polpo's fortune on the island of Capri to a gang representative. He is then given Polpo's final mission: Passione’s boss, a mysterious figure whose identity is unknown to even his subordinates, requests that his daughter Trish Una be brought safely to him in Venice . Along the way, Bucciarati's team eliminates all but one of the members of Passione's team of hitmen, who seek to use Trish as a means to identify and defeat the boss themselves.\n\nOn the boss's orders, the group retrieves a key in Pompeii and use it to access a lounge inside of Coco Jumbo, a Stand-wielding turtle. The group uses Coco Jumbo to reach Venice relatively safely, escorting Trish to the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore . Bucciarati fights the boss and his Stand, King Crimson, which can see into and skip through time by up to ten seconds. The position and identity of the boss are obscured while his Stand acts as a mouthpiece for him. Realising he intends to kill his own daughter to maintain his anonymity, Bucciarati chooses to fight but suffers grievous injuries, barely escaping with Trish. Giorno seemingly revives a dead Buccarati with life energy; it is later revealed he is still dying at a rapid rate.\n\nFugo chooses to remain loyal to the boss; the remainder of the group defect. They travel to Sardinia after Trish recalls it as the boss's birthplace, hoping to use Abbacchio's Stand, Moody Blues, to uncover his true identity. A man named Vinegar Doppio – who is revealed to be unwitting split personality of the boss – reaches Sardinia first; the boss kills Abbacchio, but before dying, Abbacchio is able to use Moody Blues to create an imprint of the boss's face, which the group later finds. The group are contacted by a third party, who reveals the boss's name as Diavolo and requests that they meet at the Colosseum in Rome to receive a special Arrow.\n\nDiavolo exploits Bucciarati's fading senses to reach the informant first, revealing him as Jean Pierre Polnareff . Diavolo fatally wounds Polnareff, forcing him to stab his own Stand, Silver Chariot, with the Arrow. Polnareff, having seemingly swapped bodies with the turtle, explains that Silver Chariot has evolved into its requiem form: Chariot Requiem, capable of swapping the souls of those in its effective range. Realising that their own Stands will attack them if they approach the Arrow, the group attacks Diavolo (in Buccarati's corpse), but he feints, killing Narancia and leaving Doppio behind to pass away in Bucciarati's corpse. Regardless, he is soon forced to reveal himself, lethally wounding Trish's soul and weakening Requiem.\n\nAt the last moment, Bucciarati sacrifices himself to dispel the soul swap, save Trish, and pass the Arrow to Giorno. Giorno uses the arrow to evolve his Stand into Gold Experience Requiem, which has the ability to revert the actions of his opponents, and, to make them experience death infinitely. With this newfound power, Giorno defeats Diavolo and condemns him to an eternal cycle of death, removed from reality. The surviving Trish, Mista and Giorno return to find Polnareff, his soul having survived within the turtle. Giorno and Polnareff agree to preserve the Arrow. Sometime afterward, Giorno becomes the new boss of Passione, with Mista and Polnareff by his side.\n\nHirohiko Araki described the themes of Golden Wind as \"human relationships,\" \"friends versus enemies,\" and \"the beauty of betrayal.\" By depicting the mafia , the author said the story deals with the sadness of having no choice in life or only one place where one belongs——the \"dark underbelly of society.\" Araki also stated that the main focus was to draw \"beautiful men\" who can only exist in a world where there is \"beauty in meeting one's doom.\" He wanted the characters, sculptures and fashion to be in the style of the Italian city of Rome . The curls in Giorno Giovanna's hair were inspired by Michelangelo 's statue David . Araki cited Guido Mista and Prosciutto as characters he enjoyed drawing; the former due to his positive attitude and for being \"true to himself without doubts\" and the latter for his \"brotherly relationship\" with his subordinate Pesci and fun Stand power. [ 8 ]\n\nIn the original volumization, chapters 437–439 are a part of Diamond Is Unbreakable .\n\nThe anime adaptation of Golden Wind was announced by series creator Hirohiko Araki at the \"Ripples of Adventure\" art exhibition on June 21, 2018, [ 44 ] and premiered the first episode at Anime Expo on July 5, 2018. The anime adaptation by David Production aired from October 5, 2018, to July 28, 2019, as part of their JoJo's Bizarre Adventure anime television series. [ 45 ] Golden Wind was directed by returning series director Naokatsu Tsuda who was accompanied by the senior writer Yasuko Kobayashi . The character designer for Golden Wind was Takahiro Kishida, and the animation director was Shun'ichi Ishimoto. Yugo Kanno returned as composer from previous seasons. [ 44 ] The series ran for 39 episodes. [ 46 ] [ 47 ]\n\nThe novel Le Bizzarre Avventure di GioGio II: Golden Heart/Golden Ring [ bm ] was written by Gichi Ōtsuka and Miya Shōtarō, and released on May 28, 2001. An Italian translation was released in 2004. [ 48 ] A second novel, Purple Smoke Distortion , [ bn ] was written by Kouhei Kadono and released on September 16, 2011. [ 49 ] [ 50 ] Viz Media will publish it in North America in spring 2026. [ 51 ]\n\nThe PlayStation 2 video game GioGio's Bizarre Adventure was released in Japan in 2002, adapting the arc. [ 52 ]\n\nIn a 2018 survey of 17,000 JoJo's Bizarre Adventure fans, Golden Wind was chosen as the favorite story arc with 19.1% of the vote. [ 53 ]\n\nBoth Screen Rant 's Steven Blackburn and Jordan Richards of AIPT Comics called Golden Wind a breath of fresh air for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure by deviating from the basic formula and following Giorno, son of villain Dio Brando, as he looks to cement a reputation and build a criminal empire. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] Jenni Lada of Siliconera also praised the protagonist Giorno and said the first volume of Golden Wind shows how skilled Araki is at getting people quickly invested in a character and story. She wrote, by giving readers a look at Giorno's past and insights into the person he is now, it emphasizes why he is compelling; \"We're introduced to his dream and see him take his first steps toward it.\" [ 56 ] Richards wrote that Part 5's vivid and imaginative Stand fights continue JoJo's Bizarre Adventure ' s \"wholly unique\" style of art not seen in any other series. However, despite calling the supporting cast a memorable bunch, Richards felt they were underdeveloped as of the first volume, but noted they had potential. [ 55 ]",
