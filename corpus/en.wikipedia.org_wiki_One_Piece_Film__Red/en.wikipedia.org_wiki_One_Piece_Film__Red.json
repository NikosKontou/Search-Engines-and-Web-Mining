everyone except Luffy who is rescued by Trafalgar Law and Bartolomeo Meanwhile the Five Elders ruling the World Government deem Uta's power a great threat to the world and Marine Fleet Admiral Aka in u orders a convoy of battleships led by Admiral sKi zar u and Fuji tora to go to E legia and subdue her Luffy's group is pursued by Uta and the concert goers and they meet Gordon who is Uta's adoptive father and the former King of E legia Gordon reveals that he raised Uta to be a great musician and kept her sheltered from the outside world but when she attained worldwide fame she began to learn of the suffering inflicted on a great number of her fans by pirates and so decided to put an end to the Pirate Era Uta then arrives and forces Luffy's group to escape and Gordon pleads with her to not carry out her plan out of fear for her safety However Uta reveals she found an inscription of a song called To t Music a that can unleash a great power and immobilizes Gordon Luffy's group comes across Ko by Helm ep po and Blue no who are operating undercover for the World Government Ko by reveals that Uta's Devil Fruit powers allow her to send people into a dream world by singing to them They and everyone else who watched the concert are trapped in this world whose reality is completely controlled by Uta The dream world ceases to exist whenever Uta falls asleep however Uta has been consuming a fungal called wake sh rooms that keeps her awake at all hours but causes her to make irrational decisions and drastically shortens her lifespan If Uta dies everyone in the dream world would be trapped there permanently In the real world the Marine fleet arrives at E legia to find the concert goers all sleeping They block their hearing to nullify Uta's singing but Uta assumes control of the concert goers ' bodies to overwhelm the Marines and remove their hearing blockers The Five Elders know that Uta has mere hours left to live and that if she dies 70 of the world's population would be trapped in the Sing Sing World Ko by's group helps the trapped pirates free themselves and the Straw Hats head towards the castle to find a weakness in Uta's power In the library

worlds those in the Sing Sing World will return to reality Uta resumes her concert in the Sing Sing World but her audience begins to resist the idea of living in her world forever Growing more and more unstable Uta transforms all of them into inanimate objects Luffy goes to confront Uta and she claims that Shanks abandoned her on E legia after destroying and plundering it Uta decides to kill Luffy in the real world but is stopped by Shanks and his crew Shanks tries to help Uta but Aka in u orders for the Marines to fire on her without regard for the concert goers forcing the Red Haired Pirates to go on the defensive Terrified at the slaughtering of her subjects and slipping into delirium from the wake sh rooms Uta summons To t Music a She then attacks Luffy in the Sing Sing World but Gordon takes the blow instead He reveals that To t Music a was actually the one that destroyed E legia 12 years ago after Uta accidentally summoned him Shanks took responsibility and left Uta on E legia afterward so she could pursue a singing career without being a wanted pirate Despite this revelation Uta confesses that she already knew the truth after finding a recording of the event a year into her music career but continued to make music out of devotion to her fans Uta is overtaken by To t Music a as it moves to consume both versions of E legia overpowering everyone on the island However Us opp is able to attain a mental link with his father Yas opp via Observation Hak i and this allows the two of them to coordinate simultaneous attacks between the forces of both worlds After a long and arduous battle Luffy and Shanks strike the finishing blows to defeat To t Music a However since it has already consumed everyone on E legia those in the Sing Sing World do not return Uta rejects a medicine from Shanks to cure the effects of the wake sh rooms in order to sing a song that will bring back everyone Once she does this the Marine forces move to seize her but Shanks repels them with his Conqueror's Hak i As the Marines retreat Shanks and Uta reconcile as father and daughter Luffy wakes up on the Thousand Sunny after his crew has already departed E legia and witnesses
