[ 3 ] [ 4 ] It is the fifteenth feature film of the One Piece film series , based on the manga series of the same name by Eiichiro Oda .\n\nIt was first announced on November 21, 2021, in commemoration of the One Piece anime episode 1000's release and following the broadcast of the episode, a teaser trailer and poster was released on November 21, 2021. Its world premiere was in Nippon Budokan , Tokyo on July 22, 2022, for the celebration of 25th anniversary of One Piece manga and released theatrically on August 6, 2022, in Japan. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ]\n\nOne Piece Film: Red received praise for its animation style, fight sequences and musical numbers. The film grossed over ¥20.33 billion in Japan making it the highest-grossing film of One Piece , the highest-grossing film of Toei Animation , the highest-grossing film of 2022 in Japan , the 4th highest-grossing Japanese film of all time in Japan , and the 6th highest-grossing film of all time in Japan . [ 9 ] The film has been number one in box office ranking in Japan for eleven consecutive weeks, a feat achieved by only three Japanese films in history. As of January 29, 2023, the film grossed over US$246.5 million worldwide, making it the 7th highest-grossing Japanese film of all time.\n\nThe Straw Hat Pirates arrive at Elegia to attend a performance by a singer named Uta. Luffy reunites with Uta, the adopted daughter of \"Red-Haired\" Shanks , who wants to liberate her world through her music. Intent on making her performance last forever and create a world with only happiness and peace, Uta implores Luffy to give up on being a pirate. When the Straw Hats resist, Uta traps everyone except Luffy, who is rescued by Trafalgar Law and Bartolomeo . Meanwhile, the Five Elders ruling the World Government deem Uta's power a great threat to the world, and Marine Fleet Admiral Akainu orders a convoy of battleships led by Admirals Kizaru and Fujitora to go to Elegia and subdue her.\n\nLuffy's group is pursued by Uta and the concertgoers, and they meet Gordon, who is Uta's adoptive father and the former King of Elegia. Gordon reveals that he raised Uta to be a great musician and kept her sheltered from the outside world, but when she attained worldwide fame, she began to learn of the suffering inflicted on a great number of her fans by pirates and so decided to put an end to the Pirate Era. Uta then arrives and forces Luffy's group to escape, and Gordon pleads with her to not carry out her plan out of fear for her safety. However, Uta reveals she found an inscription of a song called \"Tot Musica\" that can unleash a great power, and immobilizes Gordon.\n\nLuffy's group comes across Koby , Helmeppo , and Blueno who are operating undercover for the World Government. Koby reveals that Uta's Devil Fruit powers allow her to send people into a dream world by singing to them. They and everyone else who watched the concert are trapped in this world, whose reality is completely controlled by Uta. The dream world ceases to exist whenever Uta falls asleep; however, Uta has been consuming a fungal called wake-shrooms that keeps her awake at all hours, but causes her to make irrational decisions and drastically shortens her lifespan. If Uta dies, everyone in the dream world would be trapped there permanently. In the real world, the Marine fleet arrives at Elegia to find the concertgoers all sleeping. They block their hearing to nullify Uta's singing, but Uta assumes control of the concertgoers' bodies to overwhelm the Marines and remove their hearing blockers. The Five Elders know that Uta has mere hours left to live and that if she dies, 70% of the world's population would be trapped in the Sing-Sing World.\n\nKoby's group helps the trapped pirates free themselves, and the Straw Hats head towards the castle to find a weakness in Uta's power. In the library, Nico Robin discovers that there is a way to make the worlds converge by summoning Tot Musica, a demonic entity whose existence spans both worlds. If Tot Musica is defeated simultaneously in both worlds, those in the Sing-Sing World will return to reality. Uta resumes her concert in the Sing-Sing World, but her audience begins to resist the idea of living in her world forever. Growing more and more unstable, Uta transforms all of them into inanimate objects. Luffy goes to confront Uta, and she claims that Shanks abandoned her on Elegia after destroying and plundering it. Uta decides to kill Luffy in the real world, but is stopped by Shanks and his crew.\n\nShanks tries to help Uta, but Akainu orders for the Marines to fire on her without regard for the concertgoers, forcing the Red-Haired Pirates to go on the defensive. Terrified at the slaughtering of her subjects and slipping into delirium from the wake-shrooms, Uta summons Tot Musica. She then attacks Luffy in the Sing-Sing World, but Gordon takes the blow instead. He reveals that Tot Musica was actually the one that destroyed Elegia 12 years ago after Uta accidentally summoned him; Shanks took responsibility and left Uta on Elegia afterward so she could pursue a singing career without being a wanted pirate. Despite this revelation, Uta confesses that she already knew the truth after finding a recording of the event a year into her music career, but continued to make music out of devotion to her fans. Uta is overtaken by Tot Musica as it moves to consume both versions of Elegia, overpowering everyone on the island.\n\nHowever, Usopp is able to attain a mental link with his father Yasopp via Observation Haki, and this allows the two of them to coordinate simultaneous attacks between the forces of both worlds. After a long and arduous battle, Luffy and Shanks strike the finishing blows to defeat Tot Musica. However, since it has already consumed everyone on Elegia, those in the Sing-Sing World do not return. Uta rejects a medicine from Shanks to cure the effects of the wake shrooms in order to sing a song that will bring back everyone. Once she does this, the Marine forces move to seize her, but Shanks repels them with his Conqueror's Haki. As the Marines retreat, Shanks and Uta reconcile as father and daughter. Luffy wakes up on the Thousand Sunny after his crew has already departed Elegia and witnesses the Red-Haired Pirates' ship sailing away.\n\nGorō Taniguchi previously directed the 1998 OVA , One Piece: Take Down!
