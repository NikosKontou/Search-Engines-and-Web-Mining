oro and Faust VIII Yoh's group travels to America to pass the final trial for the right to participate in the Shaman Fight joined by Lys erg Die the l while encountering a group of shamans led by Yoh's estranged twin brother Hao A sakura the reincarnation of a powerful shaman who wishes to eradicate all humans and create a world for shamans The group also encounter the X Laws a group dedicated with killing Hao with Lys erg joining them Yoh's team is joined by Jo co McDonnell known as Choco love McDonnell as they engage in a series of three man matches After several matches only the teams that consist of Yoh's group the X Laws and Hao's team remain Due to Hao's level of power despite being supported by the Gandhara group in selecting Yoh Ren Ho roh oro Lys erg and Jo co as the five legendary warriors the teams forfeit the tournament in a gambit to stop Hao while he undergoes a process to merge with the Great Spirit while Gandhara acquires the Patch Tribe's five elemental spirits Though Yoh and his friends defeat ten Patch tribesmen who are obligated to protect the new Shaman King they are powerless against awaken Hao as he brings their souls and everyone they know within the Great Spirit before he commences with his goal of destroying all human life But Yoh and his friends acquire the elemental spirits and battle Hao while joined by their friends and associates revealing their goal is actually to ensure that Hao would not abuse his powers It is revealed that the Great Spirit granted Hao's wish for someone to bring back his mother's spirit With Anna's help Hao's mother is brought to the Great Spirit Convinced by his mother to forgive humanity for her death Hao decides to postpone his plan to eradicate humans so he can observe how Yoh and his friends will change the world Seven years later Hana A sakura waits at a station for the five legendary warriors and his parents Yoh and Anna Before creating Shaman King Takei an assistant of Nobuhiro Wat suki's Rur o uni Kenshin exchanged ideas about the series with the other assistants which included the creator of One Piece Eiichiro Oda 4 As a colleague of Wat suki he worked primarily as a manga assistant only focusing on his own projects during his days off 4 He was influenced by street art from hip hop and rap culture 4 which is apparent in his manga artwork 5 For drawing he used calligraphy inks and pen nibs When illustrating he used Co pic brand color markers 4 He chose shamanism as the principal topic of the series because he wanted to choose a subject that had never been approached in manga before 6 He said he incorporated his own personality and beliefs in Shaman King 4 He has an interest in the topic and choosing shamanism as the subject of this story seemed like a natural extension of that 6 For the title he said he used shaman an English word due to the fact that the nuance is really great and because he could not find a Japanese word with the accurate meaning of the word shaman 4 Another reason to have shamanism as the main subject was because he could explore elements from different cultures and their relationship with the dead and the spirits 7 Takei created the stories after he created the characters because he believed the stories are born because of the existence of the characters In addition he felt that the most important thing to create a character is to have originality 4 Through his characters he wanted to show different cultures backgrounds and values 8 When asked how do shamans of pacifist ic religions ever win the Shaman Fight he answered that the Shaman Fight is fought using the strength of the soul 4 Takei declared the final message of Shaman King is that fighting is no good 9 Written and illustrated by Hiroyuki Takei Shaman King was serialized in Shueisha's sh nen manga magazine Weekly Sh nen Jump from June 30 1998 a to an abrupt and improvised end 2 7 on August 30 2004 b The first 275 chapters were collected into 31 tank bon volumes released from December 3 1998 to October 4 2004 14 15 The release of volume 32 intended for publication on December 3 2004 was delayed and Shueisha reported they would only publish volume 32 if they receive evidence of demand from approximately 50 000 people 16 The release of the last ten chapters in tank bon format happened on January 5 2005 17 A spin off to Shaman King Fun bari Poem Fun bari no Uta published in Aka maru Jumpin 2003 and 2004 lasted for five chapters all of which were included in volume 32 Taking place seven years after the end of the manga series it features Hana A sakura son of Yoh and Anna and his journey with Ryu to find the Five Elemental Warriors for a reunion before the opening of the Fun bari Hot Springs Inn 18 Takei declared it was not a decrease in the series profitability that was the reason for its cancellation but a fatigue he had been through because he was no more able to follow his fans ' wishes In the author's opinion Shaman King was being normalized by the desire of his readers with the introduction of typical sh nen aspects and losing its originality 7 In 2007 he revealed he was planning to end the series with the finale he initially envisioned to be published in another Shueisha magazine at the end of the year or at the beginning of 2008 7 8 Eventually the entire series was reprinted in 27 kan zen ban volumes with the title Shaman King Kan zen Ban or Perfect Edition concluding with the true ending to the series 2 The new series finale was also posted on the official kan zen ban website in addition to the print editions 19 The first volume of the Perfect Edition was released on March 4 2008 with the last volume 27 being published on April 3 2009 20 21 Five years after the end of the series when the Shaman King Kan zen Ban was finished Takei said After making the readers waiting sic so much for this the last thing I wanted to do was to disappoint them He thought the ending was a huge responsibility 22 This edition served to make corrections and adjustments and for Takei it was something fun as it was different from scratch 23 Shaman King has also been published as part of the Shueisha Jump Remix series

volume for relying too heavily on the spirits as a deus ex machina stating that is what places the series on the wrong path 143 On other hand Alexander Hoffman of Comics Village declared in this first novel letting the relationships between Yoh Amid amaru and Manta flesh out is more important that developing every spiritual entity that shows up 144 Holly El ling wood of Active Anime said she was fascinated by how Takei was capable of taking several myths and cultural beliefs and blending them into the character backgrounds 145 Lori Henderson of Manga Life cited the fact every character even the villains has a reason for fighting and their internal struggles as well as the fights itself as the main reason why Shaman King is an enjoyable title 146 A reviewer for The Star declared praised the characters ' development and Takei's capacity to create new interesting ones each volume commending their backgrounds and unique personalities 147 Writing for ANN John Jak a la commented that he was struck with the unique graffiti style visual of the series 5 Although labeled its art as silly Sheena McNeil from Sequential Start expressed that it's smooth and nicely detailed with excellent expressions McNeil deemed Takei did a wonderful job of bringing shaman into the modern day but keeping it a story of fantasy 148 El ling wood stated the series ' vibrant action imaginative plot twists and a creative world makes it a unique and stylish sh nen series 149 Mania's Eduardo Chavez said that Shaman King can hit all the right buttons one volume but it could be a complete bore in the next 150 School Library Journal's Cath lee n Baxter commented that Shaman King has nonstop action with typical sh nen characters and battle styles The storyline is easy to follow and will hold the reader's interest 151 Margaret Ve ira of Active Anime however argued that the storyline gets more complex as the series progresses 152 while comics critic Jason Thompson commented that from volume 20 it seemed to veer off tracks 153 In addition of a decline on artwork in his opinion the numbers of fights also decreased Thompson wrote their enemy may be unbeatable by force alone so the plot shifts away from battles and towards unexpected betrayals character relationships and clever and confusing schemes rather than mere fighting techniques 153 The last volume especially may leave some readers feeling cheated said Leroy Dour esse aux from Comic Book Bin 154 Thompson was also disappointed by the 2004 conclusion but he wrote that the kan zen ban version has a great ending whose transcendental climax is not too different from Katsuhiro O tomo's Akira or for many American comics about beings with ultimate power 153",
