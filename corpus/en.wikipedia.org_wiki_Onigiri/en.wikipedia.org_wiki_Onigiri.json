It has become so mainstream that it is even served i niza kay as and s it down restaurants There are even specialized shops which only sell on i giri to take out Due to the popularity of this trend in Japan on i giri has become a popular staple in Japanese restaurants worldwide On i giri is not a form of sushi and should not be confused with the type of sushi called nigirizushi or simply ni giri On i giri is made with plain rice sometimes lightly salted while sushi is made of rice with vinegar sugar and salt 1 On i giri makes rice portable and easy to eat as well as preserving it while sushi originated as a way of preserving fish On November 12 1987 2 lumps of carbon i zed grains of rice thought to be rice balls were excavated from a building belonging to the Yayoi period 2000 years ago

packaging is pulled open at both ends the nori and rice come into contact and are eaten together This packaging is commonly found for both triangular on i giri and rolls citation needed Usually on i
