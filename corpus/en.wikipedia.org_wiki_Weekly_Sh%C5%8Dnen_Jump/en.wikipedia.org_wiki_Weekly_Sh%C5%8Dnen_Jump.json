magazine has sold over 7 5 billion copies since 1968 making it the best selling comic manga magazine ahead of competitors such as Weekly Sh nen Magazine and Weekly Sh nen Sunday The mid 1980 s to the mid 1990 s represents the era when the magazine's circulation was at its highest 6 53 million copies per week with a total readership of 18 million people in Japan Throughout 2021 it had an average circulation of over 1 3 million copies per week Many of the best selling manga series including One Piece Dragon Ball Naruto Demon Slayer Kim e tsu no Yai ba Slam Dunk and Kochi Ka me Tokyo Beat Cops all of which are among the top ten best selling manga of all time originate from Weekly Sh nen Jump Weekly Sh nen Jump has sister magazines such as Jump SQ V Jump Sai ky Jump and digital counterpartS h nen Jump which boasts its own exclusive titles The magazine has also had several international counterparts including the North American Weekly Shonen Jump It also spawned a crossover media franchise including anime and video games since Famicom Jump which bring together various Sh nen Jump characters Weekly Sh nen Jump was launched by Shueisha on July 11 1968 5 6 a to compete with the already successful Weekly Sh nen Magazine and Weekly Sh nen Sunday 8 Weekly Sh nen Jump's sister publication was a manga magazine called Sh nen Book which was originally a male version of the short lived sh jo manga anthology Sh jo Book 9 Prior to issue 20 Weekly Sh nen Jump was originally called simply Sh nen Jump as it was originally a bi weekly magazine In 1969 Sh nen Book ceased publication 10 at which timeS h nen Jump became a weekly magazine 10 and a new monthly magazine called Bess a tsu Sh nen Jump was made to takeS h nen Book's place This magazine was later rebranded as Monthly Sh nen Jump before eventually being discontinued and replaced by Jump SQ Hiroki Goto was appointed chief editor in 1986 and remained in the position until 1993 His tenure saw significant increases in circulation and the serialization of numerous popular series When asked about the period Goto stated We only tried to create manga that everybody can enjoy There were no specific rules Idol and tabloid magazines dominated in the Media Entertainment industry at that time and we aimed to stand out from the crowd by using only manga as our weapon 11 Famicom Jump Hero Re tsu den released in 1988 for the Family Computer was produced to commemorate the magazine's 20 th anniversary It was followed by a sequel Famicom Jump II Sai ky no Shi chin in in 1991 also for the Family Computer Sh nen Jump's circulation continued to increase year on year until 1995 peaking at 6 53 million copies By 1998 circulation had dropped to 4 15 million copies a decline in part ascribed to the conclusion of popular manga series Dragon Ball and Slam Dunk 12 13 The magazine peaked with a total readership of 18 million people in Japan during the early 1990 s 14 Circulation for the magazine continued to decline through the early 2000 s before reaching some stability around 2005 well below its earlier peak 12 In 2000 two more games were created for the purpose of commemorating the magazine's anniversaries A crossover fighting game titled Jump Super Stars was released for the Nintendo DS in 2005 It was followed by Jump Ultimate Stars in 2006 Due to the 2011 T hoku earthquake and tsunami the shipment of the 15 th issue of 2011 was delayed in some areas of Japan In response Shueisha published the series included in that issue for free on its website from March 23 to April 27 15 On July
