It has been awarded annually for serialized manga in its third iteration since 1977.\n\nThe award was originally called the Kodansha Children's Manga Award ( 講談社児童まんが賞 , Kōdansha Jidō Manga Shō ) until 1968. In 1970, it was named Kodansha Cultural Award: Children's manga category ( 講談社出版文化賞 児童まんが部門 , Kōdansha Shuppan Bunka Shō: Jidō Manga Bumon ) . The second version lasted until 1976. The company decided to create multiple categories thereafter. [ 1 ]\n\nThe award once was given out in four categories: shōnen , shōjo , children , and general. The award was formalized into the present ceremony with initially offering categories only for shōnen and shōjo in 1977. The first award for the general category was in 1982, and the first children's category award was in 2003. The children's category was merged into the shōnen and shōjo categories starting in 2015. [ 2 ]\n\nEach winning work will be honored with a bronze statuette, a certificate, and a prize of 1 million yen (about US$7,500). [ 3 ]",
