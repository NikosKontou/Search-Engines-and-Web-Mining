He rose to fame after portraying Arata Wataya in the Chihayafuru live-action trilogy in 2016, which earned him the 40th Japan Academy Newcomers of the Year Award in 2017. [ 4 ] He has since portrayed characters in many other adaptations of popular manga series, including Okuyasu Nijimura in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I (2017), Sōta in Tokyo Ghoul S (2019), Yukishiro Enishi in Rurouni Kenshin: The Final (2021), Pegasus Seiya in Knights of the Zodiac , and Roronoa Zoro in the Netflix series One Piece (both 2023).\n\nMackenyu is the son of actor and martial artist Sonny Chiba , the older brother of actor Gordon Maeda , and the younger half-brother of actress Juri Manase .

One of his most challenging roles in his career to date was Shōjo ( Little Girl ).
