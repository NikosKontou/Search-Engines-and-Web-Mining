Japan completed in 1958 At 332 9 m 1 092 ft it was the tallest tower in Japan until the construction of Tokyo Sky tree in 2012 It is a lattice tower inspired by the Eiffel Tower and is painted white and international orange to comply with air safety regulations The tower's main sources of income are tourism and antenna leasing Foot Town a four story building directly under the tower houses museums restaurants and shops Departing from there guests can visit two observation decks The two story Main Deck formerly known as the Main Observatory is at 150 m 490 ft while the smaller Top Deck formerly known as the Special Observatory reaches a height of 249 6 m 819 ft The names were changed following renovation of the top deck in 2018 4 The tower is repainted every five years taking a year to complete the process In 1961 transmission antennae were added They are used for radio and television broadcasting and now broadcast signals for media outlets such as NHK TBS Television and Fuji Television The height of the tower was not suitable for Japan's planned terrestrial digital broadcasting planned for July 2011 and for the Tokyo area A taller digital broadcasting tower known as Tokyo Sky tree was completed on 29 February 2012 Tokyo Tower has become a prominent landmark and frequently appears in media set in Tokyo A large broadcasting tower was needed in the Kant region after NHK Japan's public broadcasting station began television broadcasting in 1953 Private broadcasting companies began operating in the months following the construction of NHK's own transmission tower This communications boom led the Japanese government to believe that transmission towers would soon be built all over Tokyo eventually overrunning the city The proposed solution was the construction of one large tower capable of transmitting to the entire region 5 Furthermore because of the country's postwar boom in the 1950 s Japan was searching for a monument to symbolize its national recovery from World War II as one of the countries most ravaged by the war 6 7 His aki chi Maeda founder and president of Nippon Den pat the tower's owner and operator originally planned for the tower to be taller than the Empire State Building which at 381 m 1 250 ft was the highest structure in the world at the time However the plan fell through because of the lack of both funds and materials The tower's height was eventually determined by the distance the TV stations needed to transmit throughout the Kant region a distance of about 150 km 93 mi 5 T ach Na it designer of tall buildings in Japan was chosen to design the newly proposed tower 5 Looking to the Western world for inspiration Na it based his design on the Eiffel Tower in Paris France 8 With the help of engineering company Nikk en Sek kei Ltd Na it claimed his design could withstand earthquakes with twice the intensity of the 1923 Great Kant earthquake or typhoons with wind speeds of up to 220 km h 140 mph 5 The new construction project attracted hundreds of tobi traditional Japanese construction workers who specialized in the construction of high rise structures The Taken aka Corporation broke ground in June 1957 and each day at least 400 laborers worked on the tower 5 It was constructed of steel a third of which was scrap metal taken from US tanks damaged in the Korean War 9 10 When the 90 m 300 ft long antenna was bolted into place on 14 October 1958 Tokyo Tower was the tallest freestanding tower in the world taking the title from the Eiffel Tower by 9 m 30 ft 11 failed verification Though it is taller than the Eiffel Tower Tokyo Tower weighs about 4 000 tons 3 300 less than the Eiffel Tower 12 as it is significantly thinner and simpler in construction It was opened to the public on 23 December 1958 at a final cost of 2 8 billion 8 4 million in 1958 10 13 Tokyo Tower was mortgaged for 10 billion in 2000 14 It was the tallest artificial structure in Japan until April 2012 when it was surpassed by the Tokyo Sky tree 8 Planned as an antenna for telecommunications and brightly colored in accordance with the time's Aviation Law the tower's two panoramic observatories are mostly frequented by tourists today The tower constitutes a clear reference point in the center's skyline forming a strong landmark both night and day 15 Every five years the tower is repainted in a process that takes about a year to complete Tokyo Tower is next planned to be repainted in 2024 16 17 needs update Tokyo Tower's two main revenue sources are antenna leasing and tourism It functions as a radio and television broadcasting antenna support structure and is a tourist destination that houses several different attractions The tower recorded its 190 millionth visitor in 2024 18 Visitor numbers had been steadily declining bottoming out at 2 3 million in 2000 19 before rising since then 7 The first area tourists visit upon reaching the tower is Foot Town a four story building stationed directly under the tower There visitors can eat shop and visit several museums and galleries Elevators that depart from the first floor of Foot Town can be used to reach the first of two observation decks the two story Main Observatory 20 For the price of another ticket visitors can board another set of elevators from the second floor of the Main Observatory to reach the final observation deck the Special Observatory 21 Tokyo Tower a member of the World Federation of Great Towers has been used by many organizations for broadcasting purposes The structure was intended for broadcasting television but radio antennas were installed in 1961 because it could accommodate them 7 While analog and digital television broadcasts are no longer conducted from the site two FM radio stations remain on Tokyo Tower Stations that use or have used the tower's antenna include 12 Japan employs both analog and digital broadcasting In July 2011 all television broadcasting was changed to solely digital Tokyo Tower is not a reliable broadcasting antenna for completely digital broadcasting because the tower is not tall enough to transmit the higher frequency waves to areas surrounded by forests or high rise buildings As an alternative a new 634 m tall 2 080 ft tower called the Tokyo Sky tree was opened in 2012 7 In an attempt to make Tokyo Tower more appealing to NHK and the five other commercial broadcasters who planned to move their transmitting stations to the new tower Nihon Den pat officials drafted a plan to extend its digital broadcasting antenna by 80 to 100 m 260 to 330 ft at a cost of approximately 4 billion US 50 million 22 As a result of their move to the Sky tree only one digital television station remained on Tokyo Tower that of the Open University of Japan whose J OUD DTV and J OUD FM continued on the tower until shutting down in 2018 FM radio stations will continue to use the tower for broadcasting in the Tokyo area Masahiro Kawa da the tower's planning director raised the possibility of the tower becoming a backup for the Tokyo Sky tree depending on what the TV broadcasters want or need 7 23 The antenna's tip was damaged on 11 March 2011 by the T hoku earthquake 24 On 19 July 2012 Tokyo Tower's height shrank to 315 meters while the top antenna was repaired for damage from the earthquake 2 Located in the base of the tower is a 4 story building known as Foot Town The first floor includes the Aquarium Gallery a reception hall the 400 person capacity Tower Restaurant a Family Mart convenience store and a souvenir shop 25 26 This floor's main attractions however are the three elevators that serve as a direct ride to the Main Observatory 20 The second floor is primarily a food and shopping area In addition to the five standalone restaurants the second floor's food court consists of four restaurants including a McDonald's and a Pizza La 27 28 Foot Town's third and fourth floors house several tourist attractions The third floor is home to the Guinness World Records Museum Tokyo a museum that houses life size figures photo panels and memorabilia depicting interesting records that have been authenticated by the Guinness Book 29 The Tokyo Tower Wax Museum opened in 1970 displayed wax figures imported from London where they were made 30 until it was closed in 2013 31 The figures on display range from pop culture icons such as The Beatles to religious figures such as Jesus Christ A hologram gallery named the Gallery De Lux a lounge and a few specialty stores are also located on this floor 32 Tokyo Tower's Trick Art Gallery is located on the building's fourth and final floor This gallery displays optical illusions including paintings and objects that visitors can interact with 33 On the roof of the Foot Town building is a small amusement park that contains several small rides and hosts live performances for children 34 On weekends and holidays visitors can use the roof to access the tower's outside stairwell At approximately 660 steps the stairwell is an alternative to the tower's elevators and leads directly to the Main Observatory 35 Based on the hit manga and anime One Piece Tokyo Tower featured a small One Piece themed amusement park that opened in 2015 and closed in 2020 The amusement park offered a range of attractions shops and restaurants all based on the characters from Eiichiro Oda's manga Patrons enjoyed various games or attractions based on their favorite characters and enjoyed meals from the world of One Piece There was a gift store that features exclusive goods for One Piece fans 36 37 Tokyo Tower requires 28 000 L 7 400 US gal of paint to completely paint the structure white and international orange complying with air safety regulations 12 Before the tower's 30 th anniversary in 1987 the only lighting on the tower were light bulbs located on the corner contours that extended from the base to the antenna In the spring of 1987 Nihon Den pat invited lighting designer Motoko Ishii to visit the tower Since its opening 30 years earlier the tower's annual ticket sales had dropped significantly and in a bid to revitalize the tower and again establish it as an important tourist attraction and symbol of Tokyo Ishii was hired to redesign Tokyo Tower's lighting arrangement 38 Unveiled in 1989 the new lighting arrangement required the removal of the contour outlining light bulbs and the installation of 176 floodlights in and around the tower's frame 38 From dusk to midnight the floodlights illuminate the entire tower 12 Sodium vapor lamps are used from 2 October to 6 July to cover the tower in an orange color From 7 July to 1 October the lights are changed to metal halide lamps to illuminate the tower with a white color The reasoning behind the change is a seasonal one Ishii reasoned that orange is a warmer color and helps to offset the cold winter months Conversely white is thought a cool color that helps during the hot summer months 39 Occasionally Tokyo Tower's lighting is changed to specific arrangements for special events The tower is specially lit for some annual events Since 2000 the entire tower has been illuminated in a pink light on 1 October to highlight the beginning of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month The tower has also had a variety of special lighting arrangements for Christmas since 1994 During New Year's Eve the tower lights up at midnight with a year number displayed on one side of the observatory to mark the arrival of the new year 39 Special Japanese events have been cause to light the tower in several non traditional ways In 2002 alternating sections of the tower were lit blue to help celebrate the opening of the FIFA World Cup in Japan Alternating sections of the tower were lit green on Saint Patrick's Day in 2007 to commemorate the 50 th anniversary of Japanese Irish relations On a few occasions Tokyo Tower has even been specially lit to correspond with corporate events For example the top half of the tower was lit green to correspond with the Japanese premiere of The Matrix Reloaded and different sections of the tower were lit red white and black to commemorate the first day of sales of Coca Cola C 2 39 In the summer of 2021 the tower was lit up in Olympic colours to celebrate the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo both of which had been delayed a year due to the C OVID 19 pandemic 40 On November 18 2021 the tower was lit up at 17 17 in the red of Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Angels following the awarding of the American League MVP to two way player Shohei Ohtani 41 The tower was lit for the new millennium in 2000 with Motoko Ishii again reprising her role as the designer 42 In December 2008 Nihon Den pat spent 6 5 million to create a new night time illumination scheme titled the Diamond Veil to celebrate the tower's 50 th anniversary The arrangement featured 276 lights in seven colors equally distributed across the towers four faces 10 When employing specialty lighting on the tower the Main Observatory often plays an important role During the second international White Band Day on 10 September 2005 the tower was completely un lit except for the Main Observatory which was lit with a bright white light The resulting white ring represented the White Band referenced in the day's name The two floors of windows that make up the exterior of the Main Observatory are utilized to display words or numbers When the tower employed lighting to commemorate terrestrial digital broadcasting first being available in the Kant region on 1 December 2005 each side of the Main Observatory displayed the characters chi de ji an abbreviation for chi j de j it aru h s terrestrial digital broadcasting 39 More recently the observatory displayed both TOKYO and 2016 to stress Tokyo's 2016 Olympic bid 43 Primitive images such as hearts have also been displayed using the observatory's windows 39 Operations at the Tokyo Tower Top Deck at the height of 250 m were suspended in 2016 The Top Deck reopened on 3 March 2018 At that time Tokyo Tower also announced the renaming of both decks Renovations on the main deck which began in September 2016 caused partial closure of the deck 4 Tokyo Tower has two mascots named No pp on They are two brothers Older Brother who wears blue dungarees and Younger Brother who wears red dungarees They were unveiled on 23 December 1998 to celebrate the 40 th anniversary of Tokyo Tower 44 Just as the Eiffel Tower is often used in popular culture to immediately locate a scene in Paris Tokyo Tower is often used in the same way for Tokyo It is used in anime and manga such as Doraemon Tokyo Magnitude 8 0 Magic Knight Ray earth Please Save My Earth Cardcaptor Sakura Digimon Detective Conan Sailor Moon Ten chi Muy o and Death Note 45 The tower is frequently used in the Japanese kai ju giant monster film genre It has been the location of numerous battles and visitations by Godzilla Moth ra Gamer a and King Kong King Kong Escapes where in it is frequently destroyed and rebuilt 13 46 Tokyo Tower is represented in Unicode as a ne moji at code point U 1 F 5 FC Tokyo Tower and its construction often appears in Sh wa nostalgia fiction and non fiction where it is used as a symbol of the financial prosperity of Sh wa era Japan 47 For example the 2005 film Always San ch me no Y hi based on the popular manga series by Ry he i S aig an was a nostalgic view of life in the neighborhoods beneath the construction of Tokyo Tower",
