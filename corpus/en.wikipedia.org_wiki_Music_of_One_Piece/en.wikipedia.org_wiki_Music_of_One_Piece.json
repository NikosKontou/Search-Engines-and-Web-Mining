    "transformers_text": "More than 100 musical CDs have been created for the media franchise built around Eiichiro Oda 's manga One Piece . Various theme songs and character songs were released on a total of 51 singles , many of them were also released in collected form on the 8 compilation albums or the 17 soundtrack CDs, along with background music from the anime television series , the feature films , and video games .\n\nKohei Tanaka and Shirō Hamaguchi are the main composers for One Piece anime soundtracks including OVAs , TV specials , films except One Piece: Film Gold which was composed by Yuki Hayashi and there are numerous other artists who have worked with Kohei Tanaka and Shirō Hamaguchi to produce the soundtracks.\n\nOn August 11, 2019, it was announced that Sakuramen , a musical group would collaborate with Kohei Tanaka to compose music for the anime's Wano arc. [ 1 ]\n\nThe anime television series currently consists of 47 pieces of theme music, 27 opening themes and 21 ending themes. As of episode 279, ending themes were omitted and, starting from episode 326 onwards, opening themes were extended from 110 seconds long to 150 seconds long. In episodes 1-206 of Funimation 's English-language release of the series, the opening and ending themes were dubbed into English by various voice actors, before reverting to the Japanese versions from episodes 207 onward and later some openings were not licensed by Funimation's release, leaving only the narration dubbed on select opening themes. Starting with episode 1071, the ending theme would be reinstated after 17 years.\n\nTrack: 02, 16~25 - TV Anime One Piece\n\n01, 03~12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 25\n\nComposed and Arranged by: Kouhei
