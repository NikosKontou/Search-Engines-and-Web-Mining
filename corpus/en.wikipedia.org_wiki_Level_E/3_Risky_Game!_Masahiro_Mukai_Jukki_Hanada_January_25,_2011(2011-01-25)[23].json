The Diskunians soon corner the apartment complex, with Jinpachi demanding that Prince Baka must be handed over to the Diskunians by sundown. Sado suggests Captain Craft to jog Prince Baka's memory, but this knocks Prince Baka unconscious. As soon as sundown approaches, Colin tries to access information about the Diskunians using the crystal data system within the orb, while Jinpachi orders the Diskunians to raid Yukitaka's apartment. However, the jig is up, and Captain Craft reveals that the infiltration was actually staged by Prince Baka himself. It is shown that Prince Baka kept a secret video diary of a mock rescue operation. When Prince Baka wakes up, Captain Craft, Sado and Colin chase him out of Yukitaka's apartment to their spaceship. The Diskunians ask Yukitaka for his autograph due to being baseball fans. Three months later, Yukitaka shows Miho a letter written by Prince Baka, saying that Earth is now part of Dogra's domain, thanks to his involvement.",
