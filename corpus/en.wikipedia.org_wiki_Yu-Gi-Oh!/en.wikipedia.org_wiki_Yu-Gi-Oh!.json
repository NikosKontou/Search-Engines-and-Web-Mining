    "transformers_text": "Yu Gi Oh Japanese Hepburn Y Gi lit ' Game King ' is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kazuki Takahashi It was serialized in Shueisha's sh nen manga magazine Weekly Sh nen Jump between September 1996 and March 2004 with its chapters collected in 38 tank bon volumes The series follows Yugi Mutou a teenager who solves the ancient Egyptian Millennium Puzzle This causes Yugi to become host to a gambling alter ego or spirit who solves his conflicts with various games As the manga progresses the focus largely shifts to the card game Duel Monsters originally known as Magic Wizards where opposing players duel one another in mock battles of fantasy monsters The manga series has spawned a media franchise that includes multiple spin off manga anime series video games and a real world card game theY u Gi Oh Trading Card Game based on the fictional Duel Monsters game The first anime series adaptation simply titled Yu Gi Oh and produced by Toei Animation aired from April to October 1998 while the second one Yu Gi Oh Duel Monsters produced by NAS and animated by Gallop aired from April 2000 to September 2004 Yu Gi Oh has become one of the highest grossing media franchises of all time Yu Gi Oh follows Yugi Mutou a timid high schooler who is frequently bullied Yugi loves to play games and at the beginning of the series is solving the Millennium Puzzle Sen nen P azur u an Ancient Egyptian artifact hoping that it will grant him his wish of making friends Yugi eventually completes the Puzzle causing his body to become the host to a mysterious spirit with the personality of a gambler From that moment onwards whenever Yugi or any of his friends is threatened the spirit briefly possessing Yugi challenges the antagonist to Shadow Games Yami no G mu lit Game of Darkness that reveal that person's true nature with the loser often being subjected to an adverse Penalty Game Bats u G mu Yugi and his friends gradually learn of the spirit's existence referring to him as the other Yugi As the series progresses Yugi and his friends learn that the spirit is actually that of a nameless Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt who had lost his memories after being sealed inside the Puzzle As Yugi and his companions attempt to help the Pharaoh regain his memories they find themselves going through many trials as they wager their lives facing off against those who wield the other Millennium Items Sen nen A it emu and the dark power of the Shadow Games In the initial planning stages of Yu Gi Oh Takahashi had originally wanted to draw a horror manga 2 Although the end result was a manga revolving around games some horror elements influenced certain aspects of the story Takahashi decided to use battle as his primary theme Since there were so many manga based around fighting he found it difficult to come up with something original He decided to create a battle manga where the main character does not hit anybody but also struggled with that limitation When the word game came to mind he found it much easier to work with 3 When an interviewer asked Takahashi if he tried to introduce younger readers to real life gaming culture referenced in the series Takahashi explained that he simply included stuff he played and enjoyed and that it may have introduced readers to role playing games and others He added that he created some of the games seen in the series stressing the importance of communication between people that is often present in table top role playing games but absent in solitary video games and especially over the Internet where quality communication is near impossible 4 Takahashi had always been interested in games claiming to have been obsessed as a child and remained interested in them as an adult In a game he considered the player to become a hero He decided to base theY u Gi Oh series around such games and used this idea as the premise Yugi was a weak immature boy who became a hero when he played games With friendship being one of the major themes of Yu Gi Oh he based the names of the two major characters Y gi and J no uchi on the Japanese wordy j which means friendship He nsh in the ability to turn into something or someone else is something Takahashi believed all children dreamed of He considered Yugi's he nsh in Dark Yugi a savvy invincible games player to be a big appeal to children 5 Takahashi said that the card game held the strongest influence in the manga because it happened to evoke the most response from readers Prior to that point Takahashi did not plan to make the story about cards 6 Takahashi said that the positive message for readers of the series is that each person has a strong hidden part like human potential within himself or herself and when one encounters hardship the hidden part can emerge if one believes in him herself and in his her friends Takahashi added that this is a pretty consistent theme 6 The editor of the English version Jason Thompson said that the licensing of theY u Gi Oh manga had not been entirely coordinated so Viz decided to use many of the original character names and to keep it more or less violent and gory Thompson said that the manga was almost unchanged from the Japanese original Because the core fanbase of the series was according to Thompson 8 year old boys and a few incredible fan girls and because the series had little interest from hardcore Japanese speaking fans the kind who run scanlation sites and post on message boards as the series was perceived to be too mainstream the Viz editors allowed Thompson a surprising amount of leeway with the translation 7 In a 2004 interview the editors of the United States Shonen Jump publication mentioned that Americans were surprised when reading the stories in the first seven volumes as they had not appeared on television as a part of theY u Gi Oh Duel Monsters anime Takahashi added The story is quite violent isn't it laughs 6 The English language release of the Duel Monsters anime by 4 Kids has been subject to censorship to make it more appropriate for children for example mentions of death or violence were replaced by references to being sent to the Shadow Realm 8 The Japanese title Y gi stylized as Yu Gi Oh translates into English as Game King Y gi is also the name of the protagonist whileY gi is also the title the second personality inhabiting his body holds as an invincible game master Additionally the character names Y gi and J no uchi are based on the wordy j friendship 9 Written and illustrated by Kazuki Takahashi Yu Gi Oh was

Jak a la said that while the commercials for the second series anime made it appear completely uninteresting the manga was unexpectedly dark and moody Jak a la added that at one moment the series reminded him of Neil Gaiman's work Yugi finds himself drawn into a magical world of ancient forces where there are definite rules that must be obeyed Jak a la concluded that the fact the series uses games as plot devices opens up a lot of story possibilities and that he feared that the series had the potential to simply devolve into a tie in for the popular card game 69 Jason Thompson the editor of the English version of the manga ranked Yu Gi Oh as number three of his five personal favorite series to edit stating that he thinks the story is actually pretty solid for a shonen manga and that you can tell it was written by an older man because of the obsession with death and what might come after death which dominates the final story arc enjoying all the RPG and card gaming terminology found within the series 7 Lisa Takeuchi Cullen argued that the manga series started to garner more popularity among Japanese children with the second series because of its somewhat dark story lines leggy girls and terrifying monsters Cullen speculated that the series was not popular among Japanese parents due to it being more intended for teenagers rather than the younger children that make up the audience for franchises such as Pok mon 70 In TV Asahi's 2006 poll of the Top 100 Anime Yu Gi Oh came in 96 th 71 Yu Gi Oh was featured by Bandai as part of their Candy Toy toy line 72 73 74 A fan
