    "transformers_text": "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland commonly known as the United Kingdom UK or Britain m is a country in Northwestern Europe off the coast of the continental mainland It comprises England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland n with a population of over 69 million in 2024 The UK includes the island of Great Britain the north eastern part of the island of Ireland and most of the smaller islands within the British Isles covering 94 354 square miles 244 376 km 2 f It shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean the North Sea the English Channel the Celtic Sea and the Irish Sea while maintaining sovereignty over the British Overseas Territories The capital and largest city of both England and the UK is London Edinburgh Cardiff and Belfast are the national capitals of Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland Britain has been inhabited since the Neolithic In AD 43 the Roman conquest of Britain began The Roman departure between 383 and 410 was followed by Anglo Saxon settlement beginning around 450 In 1066 the Normans conquered England After the Wars of the Roses the Kingdom of England began to flourish resulting in the 16 th century annexation of Wales and the establishment of the British Empire Over the 17 th century the role of the British monarchy was reduced particularly as a result of the English Civil War In 1707 the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland united under the Treaty of Union to create the Kingdom of Great Britain In the Georgian era the office of prime minister became established The Acts of Union 1800 incorporated the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801 Most of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922 as the Irish Free State and the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 created the present United Kingdom The UK became the first industrialised country and was the world's foremost power for the majority of the 19 th and early 20 th centuries particularly during the Pax Britannica between 1815 and 1914 The British Empire was the leading economic power for most of the 19 th century a position supported by its agricultural prosperity its role as a dominant trading nation a massive industrial capacity significant technological achievements and the rise of 19 th century London as the world's principal financial centre At its height in the 1920 s the empire encompassed almost a quarter of the world's landmass and population and was the largest empire in history However its involvement in the First World War and in the Second World War damaged Britain's economic power and a global wave of de colonisation led to the independence of most British colonies The UK is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy o with three distinct jurisdictions England and Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland have their own governments and parliaments which control various devolved matters A developed country with an advanced economy the UK ranks amongst the largest economies by nominal GDP and is one of the world's largest exporters and importers As a nuclear state with one of the highest defence budgets the UK maintains one of the strongest militaries in Europe Its soft power influence can be observed in the legal and political systems of many of its former colonies and British culture remains globally influential particularly in language literature music and sport A great power the UK is part of numerous international organisations and forums The Acts of Union 1707 declared that the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain p 22 The term United Kingdom has occasionally been used for the former Kingdom of Great Britain although its official name from 1707 to 1800 was simply Great Britain 23 The Acts of Union 1800 formed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland Following the partition of Ireland and the independence of the Irish Free State in 1922 which left Northern Ireland as the only part of the island of Ireland within the United Kingdom the name was changed in 1927 to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 24 Although the United Kingdom is a sovereign country England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland are widely referred to as countries 25 The UK Prime Minister's website has used the phrase countries within a country to describe it 26 Some statistical summaries such as those for the twelve NUTS 1 regions refer to Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland as regions 27 Northern Ireland is also referred to as a province 28 With regard to Northern Ireland the descriptive name used can be controversial with the choice often revealing one's political preferences 29 The term Great Britain conventionally refers to the island of Great Britain or politically to England Scotland and Wales in combination 30 It is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the United Kingdom as a whole 31 The word England is occasionally used incorrectly to refer to the United Kingdom as a whole a mistake principally made by people from outside the UK 32 The term Britain is used as a synonym for Great Britain 33 34 but also sometimes for the United Kingdom 35 34 Usage is mixed the style guide of the UK Government prefers the term UK rather than Britain or British except when referring to embassies q 37 while other government documents acknowledge that both terms refer to the United Kingdom and that elsewhere British government is used at least as frequently as United Kingdom government 38 The UK Permanent Committee on Geographical Names recognises United Kingdom UK and U K as shortened and abbreviated geopolitical terms for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in its toponym ic guidelines it does not list Britain but notes that it is only the one specific nominal term ' Great Britain ' which invariably excludes Northern Ireland 38 The BBC historically preferred to use Britain as shorthand only for Great Britain though the present style guide does not take a position except that Great Britain excludes Northern Ireland 39 The adjective British is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the United Kingdom and is used in law to refer to United Kingdom citizenship and nationality 40 r People of the United Kingdom use several different terms to describe their national identity and may identify themselves as being British English Scottish Welsh Northern Irish or Irish 43 or as having a combination of different national identities 44 Settlement by Cro Magnon s of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30 000 years ago 45 The island has been continuously inhabited since the last retreat of ice around 11 500 years ago 46 By the end of the region's prehistoric period the population is thought to have belonged largely to a culture termed Insular Celtic comprising Brit tonic Britain and Gaelic Ireland 47 The Roman conquest beginning in AD 43 and the 400 year rule of southern Britain was followed by an invasion by Germanic Anglo Saxon settlers reducing the Brit tonic area mainly to what was to become Wales Cornwall and until the latter stages of the Anglo Saxon settlement the Hen Ogled d northern England and parts of southern Scotland 48 Most of the region settled by the Anglo Saxons became unified as the Kingdom of England in the 10 th century 49 Gaelic speakers in north west Britain with connections to the north east of Ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5 th century 50 united with the Picts to create the Kingdom of Scotland in the 9 th century 51 In 1066 the Normans invaded England from northern France After conquering England they seized large parts of Wales conquered much of Ireland and were invited to settle in Scotland bringing to each country feudalism on the Northern French model and Norman French culture 52 The Anglo Norman ruling class greatly influenced but eventually assimilated with the local cultures 53 Subsequent medieval English kings completed the conquest of Wales and tried unsuccessfully to annex Scotland Asserting its independence in the 1320 Declaration of Arbroath Scotland maintained its independence thereafter albeit in near constant conflict with England 54 In 1215 Magna Carta was the first document to state that no government was above the law and that citizens have rights protecting them 55 The English monarchs through inheritance of substantial territories in France and claims to the French crown were also heavily involved in conflicts in France most notably the Hundred Years ' War while the Kings of Scots were in an alliance with the French during this period 56 Early modern Britain saw religious conflict resulting from the Reformation and the introduction of Protestant state churches in each country 57 The English Reformation ushered in political constitutional social and cultural change in the 16 th century and established the Church of England It defined a national identity for England and slowly but profoundly changed people's religious beliefs 58 Wales was fully incorporated into the Kingdom of England 59 and Ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the English crown 60 In what was to become Northern Ireland the lands of the independent Catholic Gaelic nobility were confiscated and given to Protestant settlers from England and Scotland 61 In 1603 the kingdoms of England Scotland and Ireland were united in a personal union when James VI of Scotland inherited the crowns of England and Ireland and moved his court from Edinburgh to London each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political legal and religious institutions 62 In the mid 17 th century all three kingdoms were involved in a series of connected wars including the English Civil War which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy with the execution of King Charles I and the establishment of the short lived unitary republic of the Commonwealth of England Scotland and Ireland 63 Although the monarchy was restored the Interregnum along with the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the subsequent Bill of Rights 1689 in England and Claim of Right Act 1689 in Scotland ensured that unlike much of the rest of Europe royal absolutism would not prevail and a professed Catholic could never accede to the throne The British constitution would develop on the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system 64 With the founding of the Royal Society in 1660 science was greatly encouraged During this period particularly in England the development of naval power and the interest in voyages of discovery led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies particularly in North America and the Caribbean 65 Though previous attempts at uniting the two kingdoms within Great Britain in 1606 1667 and 1689 had proved unsuccessful the attempt initiated in 1705 led to the Treaty of Union of 1706 being agreed and ratified by both parliaments On 1 May 1707 the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed the result of the Acts of Union 1707 between the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland 66 In the 18 th century cabinet government developed under Robert Walpole who is considered the de facto first prime minister from 1721 to 1742 A series of Jacobite uprisings sought to remove the Protestant House of Hanover from the throne and restore the Catholic House of Stuart The Jacobites were finally defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746 after which the Scottish Highlanders were forcibly assimilated into Scotland by revoking the feudal independence of clan chiefs The British colonies in North America that broke away in the American War of Independence became the United States British imperial ambition turned towards Asia particularly to India 67 British merchants played a leading part in the Atlantic slave trade mainly between 1662 and 1807 when British or British colonial slave ships transported nearly 3 3 million slaves from Africa 68 The slaves were taken to work on plantations principally in the Caribbean but also in North America 69 However with pressure from the abolitionist movement Parliament banned the trade in 1807 banned slavery in the British Empire in 1833 and Britain took a leading role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide through the blockade of Africa and pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties 70 In 1800 the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an Act of Union uniting the two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 January 1801 71 After the defeat of France at the end of the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars 1792 1815 the United Kingdom emerged as the principal naval and imperial power with London the largest city in the world from about 1830 72 Unchallenged at sea British dominance was later described as the Pax Britannica British Peace a period of relative peace amongst the great powers 1815 1914 during which the British Empire became the global hegemon 73 74 and adopted the role of global policeman 75 76 From 1853 to 1856 Britain took part in the Crimean War allied with the Ottoman Empire against Tsarist Russia 77 Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 the British government led by Lord Palmerston assumed direct rule over India Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of regions such as East Asia and Latin America 78 Throughout the Victorian era 1837 1901 political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez faire policies Beginning with the Great Reform Act in 1832 Parliament gradually widened the voting franchise with the 1884 Reform Act championed by William Gladstone granting suffrage to a majority of males for the first time The British population increased at a dramatic rate accompanied by rapid urbanisation causing significant social and economic stresses 79 By the late 19 th century the Conservative Party under Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Salisbury initiated a period of imperial expansion in Africa maintained a policy of splendid isolation in Europe and attempted to contain the influence of the Russian Empire in Afghanistan and Persia in what came to be known as the Great Game 80 During this time Canada Australia and New Zealand were granted self governing dominion status 81 At the turn of the century Britain's industrial dominance became challenged by the German Empire and the United States 82 The Edwardian era 1901 1910 included social reform and home rule for Ireland become important domestic issues while the Labour Party emerged from an alliance of trade unions and small socialist groups in 1900 and suffragettes campaigned for women's right to vote 83 Britain was one of the principal Allies that defeated the Central Powers in the First World War 1914 1918 Alongside their French Russian and after 1917 American counterparts 84 British armed forces were engaged across much of the British Empire and in several regions of Europe particularly on the Western Front 85 The high fatalities of trench warfare caused the loss of much of a generation of men with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order Britain had suffered 2 5 million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt 85 The consequences of the war persuaded the government to expand the right to vote in national and local elections to all adult men and most adult women with the Representation of the People Act 1918 85 After the war Britain became a permanent member of the Executive Council of the League of Nations and received a mandate over a number of former German and Ottoman colonies Under the leadership of David Lloyd George the British Empire reached its greatest extent covering a fifth of the world's land surface and a quarter of its population 86 By the mid 1920 s most of the British population could listen to BBC radio programmes 87 88 Experimental television broadcasts began in 1929 and the first scheduled BBC Television Service commenced in 1936 89 The rise of Irish nationalism and disputes within Ireland over the terms of Irish Home Rule led eventually to the partition of the island in 1921 90 A period of conflict in what is now Northern Ireland occurred from June 1920 until June 1922 The Irish Free State became independent initially with Dominion status in 1922 and unambiguously independent in 1931 Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom 91 The 1928 Equal Franchise Act gave women electoral equality with men in national elections Strikes in the mid 1920 s culminated in the General Strike of 1926 Britain had still not recovered from the effects of the First World War when the Great Depression 1929 1932 led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas as well as political and social unrest with rising membership in communist and socialist parties A coalition government was formed in 1931 92 Nonetheless Britain was described as a very wealthy country formidable in arms ruthless in pursuit of its interests and sitting at the heart of a global production system 93 After Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939 Britain entered the Second World War Despite the defeat of its European allies in the first year Britain and its empire continued the war against Germany 93 In 1940 the Royal Air Force defeated the German Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain Urban areas suffered heavy bombing during the Blitz The Grand Alliance of Britain the United States and the Soviet Union formed in 1941 leading the Allies against the Axis powers There were eventual hard fought victories in the Battle of the Atlantic the North Africa campaign and the Italian campaign British forces played important roles in the Normandy landings of 1944 and the liberation of Europe The British Army led the Burma campaign against Japan and the British Pacific Fleet fought Japan at sea British scientists contributed to the American Manhattan Project whose task was to build a nuclear weapon 94 The UK was one of the Big Three powers with the US and the Soviet Union who met to plan the post war world 95 it drafted the Declaration by United Nations with the United States and became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council It worked closely with the United States to establish the International Monetary Fund the World Bank and NATO 96 The war left the UK severely weakened and financially dependent on the American Marshall Plan 97 but it was spared the total war that devastated eastern Europe 98 In the immediate post war years the Labour government under Clement Attlee initiated a radical programme of reforms which significantly affected British society in the following decades 99 Major industries and public utilities were nationalised a welfare state was established and a comprehensive publicly funded healthcare system the National Health Service was created 100 The rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with Britain's much diminished economic position after its involvement in the First World War and the Second World War so that a policy of de colonisation was unavoidable 101 102 103 Independence was granted to India and Pakistan in 1947 104 Over the next three decades most colonies of the British Empire gained their independence and many became members of the Commonwealth of Nations 105 The UK was the third country to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal with its first atomic bomb test Operation Hurricane in 1952 but the post war limitations of Britain's international role were illustrated by the Suez Crisis of 1956 The international spread of the English language the world's most widely spoken language and third most spoken native language 106 ensured the continuing international influence of its literature and culture 107 108 As a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950 s the government encouraged immigration from Commonwealth countries In the following decades the UK became a more multiracial and multicultural society 109 Despite rising living standards in the late 1950 s and 1960 s the UK's economic performance was less successful than many of its main competitors such as France West Germany and Japan The UK was the first democratic nation to lower its voting age to 18 in 1969 110 In the decades long process of European integration the UK was a founding member of the Western European Union established with the London and Paris Conferences in 1954 In 1960 the UK was one of the seven founding members of the European Free Trade Association EFTA but in 1973 it left to join the European Communities EC In a 1975 referendum 67 per cent voted to stay in it 111 When the EC became the European Union EU in 1992 the UK was one of the 12 founding member states From the late 1960 s Northern Ireland experienced communal and paramilitary violence sometimes affecting other parts of the UK known as the Troubles It is usually considered to have ended with the 1998 Belfast Good Friday Agreement 112 Following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970 s the Conservative government of the 1980 s led by Margaret Thatcher initiated a radical policy of monetarism deregulation particularly of the financial sector for example the Big Bang in 1986 and labour markets the sale of state owned companies privatisation and the withdrawal of subsidies to others 113 In 1982 Argentina invaded the British territories of South Georgia and the Falkland Islands leading to the 10 week Falklands War in which Argentine forces were defeated The inhabitants of the islands strongly favour British sovereignty expressed in a 2013 referendum From 1984 the British economy was helped by the in flow of substantial North Sea oil revenues 114 Another British Overseas Territory Gibraltar 115 is a key military base a referendum in 2002 on shared sovereignty with Spain was rejected Around the end of the 20 th century there were major changes to the governance of the UK with the establishment of devolved administrations for Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland 116 The statutory incorporation followed acceptance of the European Convention on Human Rights The UK remained a great power with global diplomatic and military influence and a leading role in the United Nations and NATO 117 The UK broadly supported the United States ' approach to the war on terror in the early 21 st century 118 British troops fought in the war in Afghanistan but controversy surrounded Britain's military deployment in Iraq which saw the largest protest in British history in opposition to the government led by Tony Blair 119 The Great Recession 2007 2010 severely affected the British economy 120 and was followed by a period of weak growth and stagnation 121 122 The Cameron Clegg coalition government of 2010 introduced austerity measures intended to tackle the substantial public deficits 123 A referendum on Scottish independence in 2014 resulted in the Scottish electorate voting by 55 3 to 44 7 per cent to remain part of the United Kingdom 124 In 2016 51 9 per cent of voters in the UK voted to leave the European Union EU 125 The UK left the EU in 2020 126 On 1 May 2021 the EU UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU came into force 127 128 The C OVID 19 pandemic had a severe impact on the British economy caused major disruptions to education and had far reaching impacts on society and politics in 2020 and 2021 129 130 131 The UK was the first country in the world to use an approved C OVID 19 vaccine developing its own vaccine which allowed the UK's vaccine rollout to be amongst the fastest in the world 132 133 The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately 94 354 square miles 244 376 km 2 f 12 with a land area of 93 723 square miles 242 741 km 2 12 It occupies the major part of the British Isles 134 and includes the island of Great Britain the north eastern one sixth of the island of Ireland and some smaller surrounding islands meaning it comprises England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland 135 Geographically the United Kingdom lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the southeast coast coming within 22 miles 35 km of the coast of northern France from which it is separated by the English Channel 136 The nearby island polities of the Isle of Man Jersey and Guernsey are crown dependencies in union with the British monarch but do not strictly form part of the United Kingdom or any of its three jurisdictions or four countries although the British government retains responsibility for their external affairs The Isle of Man lies roughly midway between Great Britain and the island of Ireland in the Irish Sea while the Channel Islands lie just off the northern French coast The Royal Greenwich Observatory in London was chosen as the defining point of the Prime Meridian 137 at the International Meridian Conference in 1884 138 The UK lies between latitudes 49 and 61 N and longitudes 9 Wand 2 E Northern Ireland shares a 310 mile 499 km land boundary with the Republic of Ireland 136 and has a 404 mile 650 km coastline 139 The length of coastline of Great Britain plus its principal islands is about 19 491 miles 31 368 km long with the coastline of the main island Great Britain being 11 073 miles 17 820 km of that 140 though measurements can vary greatly due to the coastline paradox 141 It is connected to continental Europe by the Channel Tunnel which at 31 miles 50 km 24 miles 38 km underwater is the longest underwater tunnel in the world 142 The UK contains four terrestrial ecoregions Celtic broadleaf forests English Lowlands beech forests North Atlantic moist mixed forests and Caledonian conifer forests 143 The area of woodland in the UK was estimated to be 3 25 million hectares in 2023 which represents 13 per cent of its land area 144 Most of the United Kingdom has a temperate climate with generally cool temperatures and plentiful rainfall all year round 136 The temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below 0 C 32 F or rising above 30 C 86 F 145 Some parts away from the coast of upland England Wales Northern Ireland and most of Scotland experience a subpolar oceanic climate Higher elevations in Scotland experience a continental subarctic climate and the mountains experience a tundra climate 146 The prevailing wind is from the southwest and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean 136 although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind Since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions the eastern parts are the driest Atlantic currents warmed by the Gulf Stream bring mild winters especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground Summers are warmest in the southeast of England and coolest in the north Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills 147 The average total annual sunshine in the United Kingdom was 1 339 7 hours between 1971 and 2000 148 which is just under 30 of the maximum possible citation needed The hours of sunshine vary from 1 200 to about 1 580 hours per year Since 1996 the UK has been receiving above the 1 981 to 2 010 average hours of sunshine 149 Climate change has serious impacts on the country A third of food price rise in 2023 was attributed to it 150 In 2024 the United Kingdom ranked 5 th out of 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index 151 A law has been passed that UK greenhouse gas emissions will be net zero by 2050 152 England accounts for 53 per cent of the UK covering 50 350 square miles 130 395 km 2 153 Most of the country consists of lowland terrain 154 with upland and mountainous terrain northwest of the Tees Exe line which roughly divides the UK into lowland and upland areas Lowland areas include Cornwall the New Forest the South Downs and the Norfolk Broads Upland areas include the Lake District the Pennines the Yorkshire Dales Exmoor and Dartmoor The main rivers and estuaries are the Thames Severn and the Humber England's highest mountain is Scafell Pike at 978 metres 3 209 ft in the Lake District its largest island is the Isle of Wight Scotland accounts for 32 per cent of the UK covering 30 410 square miles 78 772 km 2 155 This includes nearly 800 islands 156 notably the Hebrides Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands Scotland is the most mountainous constituent country of the UK The Highlands to the north and west are the more rugged region containing the majority of Scotland's mountainous land including the Cairngorms Loch Lomond and The Trossachs and Ben Nevis which at 1 345 metres 4 413 ft 157 is the highest point in the British Isles 158 Wales accounts for less than 9 per cent of the UK covering 8 020 square miles 20 779 km 2 159 It is mostly mountainous though South Wales is less mountainous than North and Mid Wales The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia and include Snowdon Welsh Yr Wyddfa which at 1 085 metres 3 560 ft is the highest peak in Wales 154 Wales has over 1 680 miles 2 704 kilometres of coastline including the Pembrokeshire Coast 140 Several islands lie off the Welsh mainland the largest of which is Anglesey Y nys M n Northern Ireland separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea and North Channel has an area of 5 470 square miles 14 160 km 2 and is mostly hilly It include sLough Neagh which at 150 square miles 388 km 2 is the largest lake in the British Isles by area 160 Lough Er ne which has over 150 islands and the Giant's Causeway which is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Sli eve Don ard in the Mourne Mountains at 852 metres 2 795 ft 154 The UK is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy 161 operating under the Westminster system otherwise known as a democratic parliamentary monarchy 162 It is a centralised unitary state 163 164 where in the Parliament of the United Kingdom is sovereign 165 Parliament is made up of the elected House of Commons the appointed House of Lords and the Crown as personified by the monarch s 168 The main business of Parliament takes place in the two houses 168 but royal assent is required for a bill to become an act of Parliament that is statute law 169 As a result of parliamentary sovereignty the British constitution is uncodified consisting mostly of disparate written sources including parliamentary statutes judge made case law and international treaties together with constitutional conventions 170 Nevertheless the Supreme Court recognises a number of principles underlying the British constitution such as parliamentary sovereignty the rule of law democracy and upholding international law 171 King Charles III is the monarch and head of state of the UK and 14 other independent sovereign states referred to as Commonwealth realms The monarch is formally vested with all executive authority as the personal embodiment of the Crown and is fundamental to the law and working of government in the UK 172 The disposition of such powers however including those belonging to the royal prerogative is generally exercised only on the advice of ministers of the Crown responsible to Parliament and thence to the electorate Nevertheless in the performance of official duties the monarch has the right to be consulted the right to encourage and the right to warn 173 In addition the monarch has a number of reserve powers at his disposal to uphold responsible government and prevent constitutional crises t For general elections elections to the House of Commons the UK is divided into 650 constituencies each of which is represented by one member of Parliament MP elected by the first past the post system 175 MPs hold office for up to five years and must then stand for re election if they wish to continue to be an MP 175 The Conservative Party colloquially known as the Tory Party or the Tories and the Labour Party have been the dominant political parties in the country since the 1920 s leading to the UK being described as a two party system However since the 1920 s other political parties have won seats in the House of Commons although never more than the Conservatives or Labour 176 The prime minister is the head of government in the UK 177 Acting under the direction and supervision of a Cabinet of senior ministers selected and led by the prime minister His Majesty's Government serves as the principal instrument for public policy making administers public services and through the Privy Council promulgates statutory instruments and tenders advice to the monarch 178 179 180 Nearly all prime ministers have served concurrently as First Lord of the Treasury 181 and all prime ministers have continuously served as First Lord of the Treasury since 1905 182 Minister for the Civil Service since 1968 183 and Minister for the Union since 2019 184 While appointed by the monarch in modern times the prime minister is by convention an MP the leader of the political party with the most seats in the House of Commons and holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons 185 186 The prime minister as at 2025 is Sir Keir Star mer the leader of the Labour Party Although not part of the United Kingdom the three Crown Dependencies of Jersey Guernsey and the Isle of Man as well as the 14 British Overseas Territories are subject to the sovereignty of the British Crown 187 The geographical division of the United Kingdom into counties or shires began in England and Scotland in the early Middle Ages and was completed throughout Great Britain and Ireland by the early modern period 188 Modern local government by elected councils partly based on the ancient counties was established by separate Acts of Parliament in England and Wales in 1888 Scotland in 1889 and Ireland in 1898 meaning there is no consistent system of administrative or geographic demarcation across the UK 189 and England and Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland each have their own distinct jurisdictions 190 Until the 19 th century there was little change to those arrangements but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function 191 Local government in England is complex with the distribution of functions varying according to local arrangements The upper tier subdivisions of England are the nine regions used primarily for statistical purposes 192 One of the regions Greater London has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a 1998 referendum 193 Local government in Scotland is divided into 32 council areas with a wide variation in size and population The cities of Glasgow Edinburgh Aberdeen and Dundee are separate council areas as is the Highland Council which includes a third of Scotland's area but only just over 200 000 people Local councils are made up of elected councillors of whom there are 1 223 194 Local government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself These include the cities of Cardiff Swansea and Newport which are unitary authorities in their own right 195 Elections are held every four years under the first past the post system 195 Local government in Northern Ireland since 1973 has been organised into 26 district councils each elected by single transferable vote Their powers are limited to services such as waste collection dog control and maintaining parks and cemeteries 196 In 2008 the executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils to replace the existing system 197 In the United Kingdom a process of devolution has transferred various powers from the UK Government to three of the four UK countries Scotland Northern Ireland and Wales as well as to the regions of England which since 1999 have their own governments and parliaments that control various devolved matters 198 These powers vary and have been moved to the Scottish Government the Welsh Government the Northern Ireland Executive and in England the Greater London Authority and Combined Authorities 199 Amongst the devolved parliaments across the United Kingdom the Scottish Parliament has the most extensive responsibilities for devolved powers and has been described as one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world 200 201 The UK has an uncodified constitution and constitutional matters are not amongst the powers that have been devolved Under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty the UK Parliament could in theory therefore abolish the Scottish Parliament Senedd or Northern Ireland Assembly 202 Though in the Scotland Act 2016 and the Wales Act 2017 it states that the Scottish Government and the Welsh Government are a permanent part of the United Kingdom's constitutional arrangements 203 204 In practice it would be politically difficult for the UK Parliament to abolish devolution to the Scottish Parliament and the Senedd because these institutions were created by referendums 205 The political constraints placed upon the UK Parliament's power to interfere with devolution in Northern Ireland are greater still because devolution in Northern Ireland rests upon an international

established power sharing arrangements for a devolved government and legislature referred to as the Northern Ireland Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly respectively 225 Elections to the
