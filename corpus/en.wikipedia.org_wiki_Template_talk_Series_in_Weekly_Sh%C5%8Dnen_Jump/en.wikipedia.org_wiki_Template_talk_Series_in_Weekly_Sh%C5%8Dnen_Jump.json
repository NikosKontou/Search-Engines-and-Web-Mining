    "transformers_text": "I just looked at the \"What Links Here\" section out of curiosity after seeing that the Jump page for COBRA had this template on there. Surprisingly, many Jump series that were no longer even in the magazine currently have the \"current Jump\" template. I think that its time to maybe consider a new template for WSJ series no longer in the magazine. I don't know how really we should handle this: one part of me just says to use series that already have pages, another says \"just list every Jump series\" but then we would literally have to make a template for every single year...and many years, particualrly early on, will never have a series with a page! (a third idea is maybe just do one per decade, though there it may just be linking only series with pages instead of every single Jump series ever) It won't be the same as this template (since I don't want this one crowded with every Jump series known to man), but I think that maybe it could help create a better means to direct people to Jump in a different era. - StrangerAtaru ( talk ) 20:23, 8 May 2008 (UTC) [ reply ]",
