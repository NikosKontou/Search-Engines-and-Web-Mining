    "transformers_text": "Artists ' books or book art or book objects are works of art that engage with and transform the form of a book Some are mass produced with multiple editions and some in small editions while others are produced as one of a kind objects 1 There is no single definition of an artist's book and formulating a definition is cumbersome and subject to debate 2 Importantly the creation of artists ' books incorporates a variety of formats and genres 3 They have a complex history with a particular focus and growth in contemporary artist movements 4 They also have recently grown in popularity especially in art institutions and have become popular in art library reference workshops 4 The exact definition and usage of artists ' books has become more fluid and porous alongside the growth in popularity of artists ' books 5 Artists ' books have employed a wide range of forms including the traditional Codex form as well as less common forms like scrolls fold out s concertinas or loose items contained in a box Artists have been active in printing and book production for centuries but the artist's book is primarily a late 20 th century form Book forms were also created within earlier movements such as Dada Constructivism Futurism and Fluxus 6 One suggested definition of an artist's book is as follows Artists ' books are books or book like objects over the final appearance of which an artist has had a high degree of control where the book is intended as a work of art in itself Stephen Bury 7 Generally an artist's book is interactive portable movable and easily shared Some artists ' books challenge the conventional book format and become sculptural objects Artists ' books also may be created in order to make art accessible to people outside of the formal contexts of galleries or museums 3 4 Artists ' books can be made from a variety of materials including found objects 8 The VCU Book Arts Lib Guide writes that the following methods and practices are common but certainly not the only methods in artists ' book production Whilst artists have been involved in the production of books in Europe since the early medieval period such as the Book of K ells and the Tr s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry most writers on the subject cite the English visionary artist and poet William Blake 1757 1827 as the earliest direct antecedent 6 10 Books such as Songs of Innocence and of Experience were written illustrated printed coloured and bound by Blake and his wife Catherine and the merging of handwritten texts and images created intensely vivid original works without any obvious precedents These works would set the tone for later artists ' books connecting self publishing and self distribution with the integration of text image and form citation needed All of these factors have remained key concepts in artists ' books up to the present day As Europe plunged headlong towards World War I various groups of avant garde artists across the continent started to focus on pamphlets posters manifestos and books This was partially as a way to gain publicity within an increasingly print dominated world but also as a strategy to bypass traditional gallery systems This allowed for the dissemination of new ideas and the creation of affordable work that might theoretically be seen by people who would not otherwise enter art galleries 11 This move toward radicalism was exemplified by the Italian Futurists and by Filippo Marinetti 1876 1944 in particular The publication of the Futurist Manifesto 1909 on the front cover of the French daily newspaper Le Figaro was an audacious coup de th tre that resulted in international notoriety 12 Marinetti used the ensuing fame to tour Europe kick starting movements across the continent that all veered towards book making and pamphleteer ing In London for instance Marinetti's visit directly precipitated Wyndham Lewis ' founding of the Vor tic is t movement whose literary magazine BLAST is an early example of a modernist periodical while David Bomber g's book Russian Ballet 1919 with its interspersing of a single carefully spaced text with abstract colour lithographs is a landmark in the history of English language artists ' books citation needed Regarding the creation of artists ' books the most influential offshoot of futurist principles occurred in Russia Centered in Moscow around the Gi leia Group of Trans rational z aum poets David and Nikolai Burl i uk Elena Guro Vasili Kamen ski and Veli mir Khl eb niko v the Russian futurists created a sustained series of artists ' books that challenged every assumption of orthodox book production Whilst some of the books created by this group would be relatively straightforward typeset editions of poetry many others played with form structure materials and content that still seems contemporary Key works such as World backwards 1912 by Khl eb niko v and Kru chen y kh Natalia Goncharova Lario nov Ro gov in and T atl in Trans rational Boog 1915 by Alia gro v and Kru chen y kh Olga R oz a nova and Universal War 1916 by Kru chen y kh used hand written text integrated with expressive lithographs and collage elements creating small editions with dramatic differences between individual copies Other titles experimented with materials such as wallpaper printing methods including carbon copying and he c to graphs and binding methods including the random sequencing of pages ensuring no two books would have the same contextual meaning 13 Marinetti visited in 1914 proselytizing on behalf of Futurist principles of speed danger and cacophony 14 15 Russian futurism gradually evolved into Constructivism after the Russian Revolution centered on the key figures of Malevich and T atl in Attempting to create a new proletarian art for a new communist epoch constructivist books would also have a huge impact on other European avant garde s with design and text based works such as El Lissitzky's For The Voice 1922 having a direct impact on groups inspired by or directly linked to communism Dada in Zurich and Berlin the Bauhaus in Weimar and De Stijl in the Netherlands all printed numerous books periodicals and theoretical tracts within the newly emerging International Modernist style Artists ' books from this era include Kurt Sch witter s and Kate Steinitz's book The Scarecrow 1925 and The o van Doesburg's periodical De Stijl Dada was initially started at the Cabaret Voltaire by a group of exiled artists in neutral Switzerland during World War I Originally influenced by the sound poetry of Wassily Kandinsky and the Blau e Reiter Almanac that Kandinsky had edited with Marc artists ' books periodicals manifestoes and absurd is t theatre were central to each of Dada's main incarnations Berlin Dada in particular started by Richard Hu else n beck after leaving Zurich in 1917 would publish a number of incendiary artists ' books such as George Gros z's The Face Of The Dominant Class 1921 a series of politically motivated satirical lithographs about the German bourgeoisie Whilst concerned mainly with poetry and theory Surrealism created a number of works that continued in the French tradition of the Liv re d ' Artiste whilst simultaneously subverting it Max Ernst's Une Se maine de Bon t 1934 coll aging found images from Victorian books is a famous example as is Marcel Duchamp's cover for Le Sur r al is me ' 1947 featuring a tactile three dimensional pink breast made of rubber 16 One important Russian writer artist who created artist books was Alexei Re mizo v 17 Drawing on medieval Russian literature he creatively combined dreams reality and pure whimsy in his artist books After World War II many artists in Europe attempted to rebuild links beyond nationalist boundaries and used the artist's book as a way of experimenting with form disseminating ideas and forging links with like minded groups in other countries In the fifties artists in Europe developed an interest in the book under the influence of modernist theory and in the attempt to rebuild positions destroyed by the war Dieter Schwarz 18 After the war a number of leading artists and poets started to explore the functions and forms of the book ' in a serious way ' 19 Concrete poets in Brazil such as Augusto and Harold o de Campos Cobra artists in the Netherlands and Denmark and the French Let tri sts all began to systematically deconstruct the book A fine example of the latter is Isidore Is ou's Le Grand D s ordre 1960 a work that challenges the viewer to reassemble the contents of an envelope back into a semblance of narrative Two other examples of poet artists whose work provided models for artists ' books include Marcel Brood th a ers and Ian Hamilton Finlay 20 Yves Klein in France was similarly challenging Modernist integrity with a series of works such as Yves Peintures 1954 and Di manche 1960 which turned on issues of identity and duplicity 21 Other examples from this era include Guy De bord and Asger Jorn's two collaborations Fin de C open hague 1957 and M moires ' 1959 two works of Psycho geography created from found magazines of Copenhagen and Paris respectively collage d and then printed over in unrelated colours 22 Often credited with defining the modern artist's book Dieter Roth 1930 98 produced a series of works which systematically deconstructed the form of the book throughout the fifties and sixties 23 These disrupted the codex's authority by creating books with holes in e g Picture Book 1957 allowing the viewer to see more than one page at the same time Roth was also the first artist to re use found books comic books printer's end papers and newspapers such as Daily Mirror 1961 and AC 1964 24 25 Although originally produced in Iceland in extremely small editions Roth's books would be produced in increasingly large runs through numerous publishers in Europe and North America and would ultimately be reprinted together by the German publisher Hans j rg Mayer in the 1970 s making them more widely available in the last half century than the work of any other comparable artist Almost contemporaneously in the United States Ed Rus cha 1937 present printed his first book Twenty six Gasoline Stations in 1963 in an edition of 400 but had printed almost 4000 copies by the end of the decade 26 The book is directly related to American photographic travelogues such as Robert Frank's The Americans ' 1965 but deals with a banal journey on route 66 between Rus cha's home in Los Angeles and his parents ' in Oklahoma 27 Like Roth Rus cha created a series of homogenous books throughout the sixties including Every Building on the Sunset Strip 1966 and Royal Road Test 1967 A Swiss artist worth mentioning is War j a Honegger Lava ter who created artists ' books contemporaneously with Dieter Roth and Ed Rus cha Growing out of John Cage's Experimental Composition classes from 1957 to 1959 at the New School for Social Research Fluxus was a loose collective of artists from North America and Europe that centered on George Mac i un as 1931 78 who was born in Lithuania Mac i un as set up the AG Gallery in New York 1961 with the intention of putting on events and selling books and multiples by artists he liked The gallery closed within a year apparently having failed to sell a single item 28 The collective survived and featured an ever changing roster of like minded artists including George Brecht Joseph Beuys Davi Det Ho mps on Daniel S po err i Yoko Ono Emmett Williams and Nam June Paik 29 30 Artists ' books such as An Anthology of Chance Operations and multiples 31 as well as happenings were central to Fluxus ' ethos disdaining galleries and institutions replacing them with art in the community and the definition of what was and wasn't a book became increasingly elastic throughout the decade as the two forms collided Many of the Fluxus editions share characteristics with both George Brecht's Water Yam 1963 for instance involves a series of scores collected in a box whilst similar scores are collected together in a bound book in Yoko Ono's Grapefruit 1964 Another famous example is Literature Sausage by Dieter Roth one of many artists to be affiliated to Fluxus at one or other point in its history each one was made from a pulped book mixed with onions and spices and stuffed into sausage skin Literally a book but utterly unreadable L its a S pathi and Ruud Jansen of the Fluxus Heidelberg Center in the Netherlands have an online archive of fluxus publications and fluxus webs links 32 Artists ' books began to proliferate in the sixties and seventies in the prevailing climate of social and political activism Inexpensive disposable editions were one manifestation of the de materialization of the art object and the new emphasis on process It was at this time too that a number of artist controlled alternatives began to develop to provide a forum and venue for many artists denied access to the traditional gallery and museum structure Independent art publishing was one of these alternatives and artists ' books became part of the ferment of experimental forms Joan Lyons 33 Additionally critical to the Fluxus and The Multiple movements was D rucker's term democratic multiple 46 5 Democratic multiple refers to the creation of artists books in high edition numbers to make them more publicly available for the everyday consumer This coincided with the rise of the Fluxus and The Multiple movements and enabled broader participation in the creation and dissemination of artist's books The artist's book proved central to the development of conceptual art Lawrence Weiner Bruce Nau man and Sol Le Witt in North America Art Language in the United Kingdom Maurizio Nan nu cci in Italy Jochen Ger zand Jean Le Gac in France and Jaros law K oz low ski in Poland all used the artist's book as a central part of their art practice An early example the exhibition January 5 31 1969 organised in rented office space in New York City by Seth Siegel a ub featured nothing except a stack of artists ' books also called January 5 31 1969 and featuring predominantly text based work by Lawrence Weiner Douglas Hue b ler Joseph Kos u th and Robert Barry Sol Le Witt's Brick Wall 1977 for instance simply chronicled shadows as they passed across a brick wall Maurizio Nan nu cci M 40 with 92 typesetting pages 1967 and Def in i zion i Definitions 1970 whilst K oz low ski's Reality 1972 took a section of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason removing all of the text leaving only the punctuation behind Another example is the E in be tonier tes Buch 34 1971 book in concrete by Wolf Vos tell Louise Odes Nea der land the founder and Director of the non profit group International Society of Copier Artists I S C A helped to establish electrostatic art as a legitimate art form and to offer a means of distribution and exhibition to Xerox book Artists Volume 1 1 of The I S C A Quarterly was issued in April 1982 in a folio of 50 eight by eleven inch unbound prints in black and white or color Xerography Each contributing artist's work of Xerox art was numbered in the Table of Contents and the corresponding number was stamped on the back of each artist's work The format changed over the years and eventually included an Annual Book works Edition which contained a box of small handmade books from the I S C A contributors citation needed After the advent of home computers and printers made it easier for artists to do what the copy machine formerly did Volume 21 4 in June 2003 was the final issue The 21 years of The I S C A Quarterlies represented a visual record of artists responses to timely social and political issues as well as to personal experiences 35 The complete I S C A quarterly collection is housed and catalogued at the Jaffe Center for Book Arts at the Florida Atlantic University library 36 As the form has expanded many of the original distinctive elements of artists ' books have been lost blurred or transgressed Artists such as Cy Twombly Anselm Kiefer and PINK de Thierry with her series Encyclopaedia Arcadia 37 routinely make unique hand crafted books in a deliberate reaction to the small mass produced editions of previous generations Albert Oehlen for instance whilst still keeping artists ' books central to his practice has created a series of works that have more in common with Victorian sketchbooks A return to the cheap mass produced aesthetic has been evidenced since the early 90 s with artists such as Mark Paws on and Karen Rei mer making cheap mass production central to their practice Contemporary and post conceptual artists also have made artist's books an important aspect of their practice notably William Weg man Bob Cobb ing Martin Kippen berger Raymond Pet tib on Freddy Flores K nist off and Suze Ro to lo Book artists in pop up books and other three dimensional one of a kind books include Bruce Schnabel Carol Barton He di Kyle Julie Chen Ed Hutch in s and Susan Joy Share Many book artists working in traditional as well as non traditional forms have taught and shared their art in workshops at centers such as the Center for Book Arts 38 in New York City and the Visual Arts Studio Vis Arts the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Studio School the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Statewide Outreach Program and the no longer extant Richmond Printmaking Workshop all in Richmond Virginia Other institutions devoted to the art form includeS an Francisco Center for the Book Visual Studies Workshop in Rochester New York and Women's Studio Workshop in Rosen dale New York There are a variety of manners in which one can purchase and learn more about artists books In fact the recent boom in artists ' books production and dissemination is closely linked to art book fairs Even if the buzz of interest in publication as an art practice around the turn of the twenty first century resembles the hype around the artist s book in the 1970 s the phenomenon of art book fairs in this quantity and intensity is something new Art book fairs today are not only a venue for representing a separate prior publishing scene they are also a central forum for constituting and nurturing a community around publishing as artistic practice Michal is Pic hler 39 Many bookstores facilitate the dissemination of artists books Printed Matter in New York City hosts an expansive collection of purchasable artists books They offer artists the opportunity to submit their book for printing and then selling in their store giving artists a platform to disseminate their work Printed Matter is also an important distributor of artists books for both individuals and institutions One other important way to find and or buy artists books is through Artists Book Fairs which provide spaces for artists and their app re cia tors to come together and share disseminate buy artist books Tony White provides a list of some artist books fairs that offer a place for dissemination and sharing Artist book fairs Los Angeles New York Seoul Tokyo Mexico City etc Codex International Book Art Fair 8 Ball Zine Fair Tokyo I Never Read Art Book Fair Basel Libro s Mutant es Madrid MISS Read Artist Book Fair Berlin Off print Art Book Fair Paris and London Ren contre s d Arles Tony White 4 In the early 1970 s the artist's book began to be recognized as a distinct genre and with this recognition came the beginnings of critical appreciation of and debate on the subject Institutions devoted to the study and teaching of the form were founded The Center for Book Arts in New York for example library and art museum collections began to create new rubrics with which to classify and catalog artists ' books and also actively began to expand their fledgling collections new collections were founded such as Franklin Furnace in New York and numerous group exhibitions of artist's books were organized in Europe and America notably one at Moore College of Art and Design in Philadelphia in 1973 the catalog of which according to Stefan K lima's Artists Books A Critical Survey of the Literature is the first place the term Artist's Book was used Artists ' books became a popular form for feminist artists beginning in the 1970 s The Women's Studio Workshop NY and the Women's Graphic Center at the Woman's Building LA founded by graphic designer Sheila de Bretteville were centers where women artists could work and explore feminist themes 40 Bookstores specializing in artists ' books were founded usually by artists including E cart in 1968 Geneva Other Books and So in 1975 Amsterdam Art Metro pole in 1974 Toronto and Printed Matter in New York 1976 All of these also had publishing programmes over the years and the latter two are still active today In the 1980 s this consolidation of the field intensified with an increasing number of practitioners greater commercialization and also the appearance of a number of critical publications devoted to the form In 1983 for example Cathy Courtney began a regular column for the London based Art Monthly Courtney contributed articles for 17 years and this feature continues today with different contributors The Library of Congress adopted the term artists books in 1980 in its list of established subjects and maintains an active collection in its Rare Book and Special Collections Division In the 1980 s and 1990 s BA MA and MFA programs in Book Art were founded some notable examples of which are the MFA at Mills College in California the MFA at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia the MA at Camberwell College of Arts in London and the BA at the College of Creative Studies at the University of California Santa Barbara The Journal of Artists ' Books JAB was founded in 1994 to raise the level of critical inquiry about artists ' books In 1994 a National Book Art Exhibition 41 Art ex libris 42 43 was held at Artspace Gallery in Richmond Virginia and the Virginia Commission for the Arts awarded a technical assistance grant for videotaping the exhibition 44 In 1995 excerpts from Art ex Libris The National Book Art Invitational at Artspace video documentary were shown in the Frances and Armand Hammer Auditorium at the 4 th Biannual Book Arts Fair sponsored by Pyramid Atlantic Art Center at the Corcoran Gallery of Art In 1996 the Art ex Libris documentary was included in an auction at Swann Galleries to benefit the Center for Book Arts in New York City Many of the books exhibited in Art ex Libris at Artspace Gallery and Art ex Machina at 1708 Gallery are now in the S a ckner Archive of Concrete and Visual Poetry in Miami Florida In recent decades the artist's book has been developed by way of the artists ' record album concept pioneered by Laurie Anderson into new media forms including the artist's CD ROM and the artist's DVD ROM Beginning in 2007 the Codex Foundation began its Book Fair and Symposium 45 a biennial 4 day event in the San Francisco Bay Area attended by collectors and producers of artist books as well as laypeople and academics interested in the medium A number of critical issues around artists ' book have been debated including their content form function and usage These issues and debates include The name itself has been called into question and an exact definition is hard to create There are many different terms that often overlap and thus distinguishing between the terms artist's book book art book works liv re d ' artiste fine press books etc can be difficult Some scholars and artists argue that the definition should be encapsulated in its broadest sense as Tony White argues the simplest definition uses the Duchamp ian prompt ' It's an artist book if the artist says it is ' 99 4 Lucy Lip p ard argues that the term artist book refers to an entirely distinct form of art neither an art book collected reproductions of separate art works nor a book on art critical exegeses and or artists writings the artist s book is a work of art on its own conceived specifically for the book form and often published by the artist him herself quoted in White 45 4 5 John Perreault follows on this thinking determining that artists ' books make art statements in their own right within the context of art rather than of literature 15 51 Ulises Carri n builds upon this understanding artists ' books as autonomous forms that are not reduced only to text like a traditional book 52 This thinking mostly comes about because artists ' books are often a production something to be experienced and engaged with rather than simply read 17 51 Nevertheless this variety of thinking and terminology about artists ' books indicates there is no monolithic conception of an artist's book it is open to a variety of definitions and interpretations However some artists have asserted that the term artist's book is problematic and sounds outdated Artist s book as a term is problematic because it ghetto ize s enforces the separation from broader everyday practices and limits the subversive potential of books by putting an art tag on them While extended discussions have taken place around the term including heated debate over whether and where to put the apostrophe in artist s book Lawrence Weiner once cut through the Gord ian knot by concluding Don t call it an artist s book just call it a book Michal is Pic hler 53 No matter the terminology or naming convention contemporary scholars understand the artist to have full control over the creation meaning and purpose of the artist's book 3 One critical issue related to artists ' books is how they function politically Artists ' books are often artistic expressions that challenge dominant political systems and this can occur in a variety of manners Often artists ' books are created independently outside of the art gallery system world which as White argues is one way to challenge how the art gallery world privileges works by predominantly white male artists 224 11 Working independently is a critical way to incorporate new and emerging voices allowing for greater equity and inclusion and for more diverse voices and perspectives 224 11 This notion of working independently is often combined with working through intersection ali ty where the artist's lived experience directly impacts the creation of the artist's book Clearly this focus on incorporating new artists from a variety of backgrounds and experiences challenges white he t ero normative systems Queer artists for instance often use the artist's book form to make their lives and experiences visible in the face of oppression Part of the reason for this is that both Queer people and artists ' books exist on the fringes of larger communities 47 As Queer people are marginalized in our society so are artists ' books in the art world according to Caro s one and Freeman 47 Yet it is in this margin aliz ation that artists ' books create new narratives outside of he ter on or mati vit y and give spaces for Queer people to fully express themselves As Caro s one concludes I feel that there is definitely something queer about artists ' books 47 In this way we see another example of intersection ali ty between the artist book form and Queer identities One other critical issue is how the form of the artist book is related to issues of illness and corporeal it y Amanda Couch for instance has written extensively on how the production of artists ' books mirrors forms of digestion both in terms of the physical construction of the artist book and the experience of digesting an artist book when viewing the material The actual structure of one of Couch's artist books mirrors the bodily system of digestion the accordion format itself is an embodiment of the digestive system emulating the alimentary tract within the belly cavity 9 50 Combining with the actual material it y and structure of the artist book is the actual writing of the book As Couch notes she specifically constructed the text to mirror the undulating and curving structure of the digestion pathway the cursive text has no spaces a scrip to continua which runs across and back along its nine meter length Each word is tied to the previous to the next and to the subsequent line from left to right then upside down right to left Writing in a curve where the bends also recall medical diagrams of coiled intestines 9 50 In this Couch argues that the artist book is a way to visually represent physical processes of the body This represents how artists ' books can be used to simulate and or mirror issues of the body this as Couch argues allows for a more personal communication of one's body functions Similar to Couch's conversations Bola ki argues that there is an increasing intersection between artists books and medical humanities 49 Bola ki envisions artists book that talk about disabilities illnesses as a way to stop the reduction of chronic illness stories experiences to just medical data 21 22 49 By this Bola ki recognizes that many doctors favor a data only approach to talking about chronic illness that prevents the actual lived experience of the patient from being realized also called the medical model of disability In examining the artists books of three separate artists Bola ki finds that artists ' books can provide invaluable insights into a range of embodied experiences offering in the process an intimate authority that encourages the medical and health humanities community to rethink key assumptions of illness narrative s 24 49 One artist Bola ki discusses is Martha Hall Hall was well known for crafting artists books that detailed her struggles with cancer One of her most famous works is The Rest of My Life II which includes a box of the artist's calendar and other planning documents detailing the intricacies the struggles of scheduling medical appointments in addition to her everyday life Bola ki utilizes the complexity of the artist book form as demonstrated in Hall's The Rest of My Life II to indicate how a tactile and multi sensory engagement like this can offer a more complete understanding of someone's experiences with disability and chronic illness 37 49 For Hall her doctors only considered her body in terms of its disease they did not consider the stress and labor involved in life outside of the medical office The artist book form communicates this understanding",
