fans laugh for several years Whether it's intentional or with his reluctant cowardice Us opp has had some of the most unique interactions in the story However his most iconic scene to date is one that's played totally straight Adorned as the incredible Sniper King he's asked by Luffy to declare war on the world itself Raising his slingshot up high Sniper King shoots down the World Government's flag in a fiery blaze that turns it to ashes and lights up the whole sky With just a slingshot Us opp managed to hit fans pretty deep 4 In another article Cu bill as stated More fiction than fighter Us opp has skirted his way through the series with tales so detailed and grand that he often uses them to trick his enemies However he always saves his best lies for his crew as he realizes any adventure with Monkey D Luffy could spell disaster for him So like a lot of kids trying to get out of middle school gym Us opp turns to the doctors ' notes If Us opp doesn't want to go somewhere or if
