Coby tries to stop Luffy, but Luffy defeats him almost instantly. Luffy encounters more Pacifistas, but Hancock stands in their way to allow him to advance. Jozu and Marco are defeated by Kizaru and Aokiji. Whitebeard receives even more injuries from the Marines, but fights on for the sake of his men. The executioners try to execute Ace again, but Luffy incapacitates them with his too powerful Haki of the Supreme King.",
