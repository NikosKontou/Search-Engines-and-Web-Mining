They attempt to ride the wave, but become stuck on the top when Aokiji freezes it. After hearing a report that Ace's execution will happen early, they attempt to break free, but fall into the hole Jozu created. Luffy checks to see that Ace is still alive, then stops Crocodile from attacking Whitebeard. Whitebeard notices that Luffy has \"Red-Haired\" Shanks's hat, and Luffy, unfazed by Whitebeard's power or reputation, tells him that he will rescue Ace and become the King of the Pirates.",
