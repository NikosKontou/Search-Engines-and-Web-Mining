Meanwhile, Luffy's ship approaches the Gates of Justice, blocking his path through Marineford. After Ace finally reaches the execution platform, Marine Fleet Admiral Sengoku asks who his biological father is, but Ace insists that Whitebeard is his father. However, Sengoku reveals to the world via Transponder Snail that Ace's biological mother is Portgas D.
