Luffy receives the key to Ace's handcuffs from Hancock and happily hugs him as thanks, Hancock faints by Luffy's hug and fantasizes about a wedding ceremony held on Amazon Lily between herself and Luffy with the entire Kuja tribe witnessing. Ivankov fights against Kuma while Luffy continues to advance up the battlefield. Crocodile defeats a myriad of Whitebeard's lower-ranking men to reach him, but is assaulted by Jozu, who is then halted by Doflamingo. Mihawk then steps up to block Luffy's path to the execution platform.",
