On Weatheria, Nami attempts to flee from the island by stealing a local balloon, but it crashes and Nami is captured by the townspeople as a traitor. After Nami bursts into tears while talking about Luffy's failure to save Ace, she flees with Haredas and is eventually chased by the townspeople yet again. Meanwhile, on Karakuri Island, Franky asks Kitton to use his ship, only to be rejected. When he is told that there is an ice breaker developed in Dr. Vegapunk's laboratory, he finds the laboratory and is chased by the Marines. Franky discovers blueprints and a button with a pirate mark. When he pushes the button, it explodes, destroying the laboratory, and seemingly killing Franky.",
