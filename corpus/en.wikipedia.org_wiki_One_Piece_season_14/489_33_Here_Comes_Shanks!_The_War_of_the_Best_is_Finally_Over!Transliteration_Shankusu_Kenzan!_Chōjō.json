Law's submarine barely escapes from Aokiji and Kizaru's attacks, and Kizaru declares that they will have to give up if that did not kill Luffy. Hancock requests a Marine ship to go after Luffy out of concern for him. Shanks convinces the Marines, the Whitebeard Pirates, and the Blackbeard Pirates to stand down by saying that fighting will only lead to more casualties, and declaring that he will fight those who still wish to do so. All those involved agree, and the Summit War of Marineford finally ends.",
