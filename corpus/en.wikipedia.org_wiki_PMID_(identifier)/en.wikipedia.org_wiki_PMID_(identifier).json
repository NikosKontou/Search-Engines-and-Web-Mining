    "transformers_text": "PubMed is an openly accessible free database which includes primarily theMED LINE database of references and abstract sonlife sciences and biomedical topics The United States National Library of Medicine NLM at the National Institutes of Health maintains the database as part of the Entre z system of information retrieval 1 From 1971 to 1997 online access to the MED LINE database was provided via computer using phone lines primarily through institutional facilities such as university libraries 2 PubMed first released in January 1996 ushered in the era of private free home and office based MED LINE searching 3 The PubMed system was offered free to the public starting in June 1997 2 In addition to MED LINE PubMed provides access to Many PubMed records contain links to full text articles some of which are freely available often in PubMed Central 5 and local mirrors such as Europe PubMed Central 6 Information about the journals indexed in MED LINE and available through PubMed is found in the NLM Catalog 7 As of 23 May 2023 update PubMed has more than 35 million citations and abstracts dating back to 1966 selectively to the year 1865 and very selectively to 1809 As of the same date update 24 6 million of PubMed's records are listed with their abstracts and 26 8 million records have links to full text versions of which 10 9 million articles are available full text for free 8 Over the last 10 years ending 31 December 2019 an average of nearly one million new records were added each year citation needed In 2016 NLM changed the indexing system so that publishers are able to directly correct typos and errors in PubMed indexed articles 9 PubMed has been reported to include some articles published in predatory journals MED LINE and PubMed policies for the selection of journals for database inclusion are slightly different Weaknesses in the criteria and procedures for indexing journals in PubMed Central may allow publications from predatory journals to leak into PubMed 10 A new PubMed interface was launched in October 2009 and encouraged the use of such quick Google like search formulations they have also been described as ' telegram ' searches 11 By default the results are sorted by Most Recent but this can be changed to Best Match Publication Date First Author Last Author Journal or Title 12 The PubMed website design and domain was updated in January 2020 and became default on 15 May 2020 with the updated and new features 13 There was a critical reaction from many researchers who frequently use the site 14 PubMed MED LINE can be accessed via handheld devices using for instance the PICO option for focused clinical questions created by the NLM 15 A PubMed Mobile option providing access to a mobile friendly simplified PubMed version is also available 16 Simple searches on PubMed can be carried out by entering key aspects of a subject into PubMed's search window PubMed translates this initial search formulation and automatically adds field names relevant MeSH Medical Subject Headings terms synonyms Boolean operators and ' nests ' the resulting terms appropriately enhancing the search formulation significantly in particular by routinely combining using the OR operator text words and MeSH terms For optimal searches in PubMed it is necessary to understand its core component MED LINE and especially of the MeSH Medical Subject Headings controlled vocabulary used to index MED LINE articles They may also require complex search strategies use of field names tags proper use of limits and other features reference librarians and search specialists offer search services 17 18 The search into PubMed's search window is only recommended for the search of unequivocal topics or new interventions that do not yet have a MeSH heading created as well as for the search for commercial brands of medicines and proper nouns It is also useful when there is no suitable heading or the descriptor represents a partial aspect The search using the thesaurus MeSH is more accurate and will give fewer irrelevant results In addition it saves the disadvantage of the free text search in which the spelling singular plural or abbreviated differences have to be taken into consideration On the other side articles more recently incorporated into the database to which descriptors have not yet been assigned will not be found Therefore to guarantee an exhaustive search a combination of controlled language headings and free text terms must be used 19 When a journal article is indexed numerous article parameters are extracted and stored as structured information Such parameters are Article Type MeSH terms e g Clinical Trial Secondary identifiers MeSH terms Language Country of the Journal or publication history e publication date print journal publication date Publication type parameter allows searching by the type of publication including reports of various kinds of clinical research 20 Since July 2005 the MED LINE article indexing process extracts identifiers from the article abstract and puts those in a field called Secondary Identifier SI The secondary identifier field is to store accession numbers to various databases of molecular sequence data gene expression or chemical compounds and clinical trial IDs For clinical trials PubMed extracts trial IDs for the two largest trial registries Clinical Trials gov NC T identifier and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register IRC TN identifier 21 A reference which is judged particularly relevant can be marked and related articles can be identified If relevant several studies can be selected and related articles to all of them can be generated on PubMed or any of the other NC BI Entre z databases using the ' Find related data ' option The related articles are then listed in order of relatedness To create these lists of related articles PubMed compares words from the title and abstract of each citation as well as the MeSH headings assigned using a powerful word weighted algorithm 22 The ' related articles ' function has been judged to be so precise that the authors of a paper suggested it can be used instead of a full search 23 PubMed automatically links to MeSH terms and subheadings Examples would be bad breath links to and includes in the search halitosis and heart attack to myocardial infarction Where appropriate these MeSH terms are automatically expanded that is include more specific terms Terms like nursing are automatically linked to Nursing MeSH or Nursing Subheading This feature is called Auto Term Mapping and is enacted by default in free text searching but not exact phrase searching i e enclosing the search query with double quotes 24 This feature makes PubMed searches more sensitive and avoids false negative missed hits by compensating for the diversity of medical terminology 24 PubMed does not apply automatic mapping of the term in the following circumstances by writing the quoted phrase e g kidney all o graft when truncated on the asterisk e g kidney all o graft and when looking with field labels e g Cancer ti 19 The PubMed optional facility My NC BI with free registration provides tools for and a wide range of other options 25 The My NC BI area can be accessed from any computer with web access An earlier version of My NC BI was called PubMed Cubby 26 Link Out is an NLM facility to link and make available full text local journal holdings 27 Some 3 200 sites mainly academic institutions participate in this NLM facility as of March 2010 update from Aalborg University in Denmark to Zy mo Genetics in Seattle 28 Users at these institutions see their institution's logo within the PubMed search result if the journal is held at that institution and can access the full text Link out is being consolidated with Outside Tool as of the major platform update coming in the Summer of 2019 29 In 2016 PubMed allows authors of articles to comment on articles indexed by PubMed This feature was initially tested in a pilot mode since 2013 and was made permanent in 2016 30 In February 2018 PubMed Commons was discontinued due to the fact that usage has remained minimal 31 32 ask MED LINE a free text natural language query tool for MED LINE PubMed developed by the NLM also suitable for handheld s 33 A PMID PubMed identifier or PubMed unique identifier 34 is a unique integer value starting at 1 assigned to each PubMed record A PMID is not the same as a PM CID PubMed Central identifier which is the identifier for all works published in the free to access PubMed Central 35 The assignment of a PMID or PM CID to a publication tells the reader nothing about the type or quality of the content PMID s are assigned to letters to the editor editorial opinions op ed columns and any other piece that the editor chooses to include in the journal as well as peer reviewed papers The existence of the identification number is also not proof that the papers have not been retracted for fraud incompetence or misconduct The announcement about any corrections to original papers may be assigned a PMID citation needed Each number that is entered in the PubMed search window is treated by default as if it were a PMID Therefore any reference in PubMed can be located using the PMID citation needed The National Library of Medicine leases the MED LINE information to a number of private vendors such as Em base Ovid Dialog EBS CO Knowledge Finder and many other commercial non commercial and academic providers 36 As of October 2008 update more than 500 licenses had been issued more than 200 of them to providers outside the United States As licenses to use MED LINE data are available for free the NLM in effect provides a free testing ground for a wide range 37 of alternative interfaces and 3 rd party additions to PubMed one of a very few large professionally curate d databases which offers this option Lu identifies a sample of 28 current and free Web based PubMed versions requiring no installation or registration which are grouped into four categories 37 As most of these and other alternatives rely essentially on PubMed MED LINE data leased under license from the NLM PubMed the term PubMed derivatives has been suggested 37 Without the need to store about 90 GB of original PubMed Datasets anybody can write PubMed

Ultrasound of the Week PMID 2 cite and Cite this for me In 2025 the ZB Med the German National Library of Medicine announced plans to develop an internationally supported open source version of PubMed 49 50 Alternative methods to mine the data in PubMed use programming environments such as Mat lab Python orR In these cases queries of PubMed are written as lines of code and passed to PubMed and the response is then processed directly in the programming environment citation needed Code can be automated to systematically query with different keywords such as disease year organs etc For bulk processing the full PubMed database is available as XML which can be downloaded from an FTP server The annual baseline is released in December followed by daily update files 51 In addition to its traditional role as a biomedical database PubMed has become common resource for training biomedical language models 52 The data accessible by PubMed can be mirrored locally using an unofficial tool such as ME DOC 53 Millions of PubMed records augment various open data datasets about open access like Un pay wall Data analysis tools like Un pay wall Journals are used by libraries to assist with big deal cancellations libraries can avoid subscriptions for materials already served by instant open access via open archives like PubMed Central 54",
