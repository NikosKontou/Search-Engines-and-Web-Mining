The organization says that it has more than ten million members and supporters around the world 3 The stated mission of the organization is to campaign for a world in which every person enjoys all of the human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments 4 The organization has played a notable role on human rights issues due to its frequent citation in media and by world leaders 5 6 A I was founded in London in 1961 by the lawyer Peter Be nen son 7 In what he called The Forgotten Prisoners and An Appeal for Amnesty which appeared on the front page of the British newspaper The Observer Be nen son wrote about two students who toasted to freedom in Portugal and four other people who had been jailed in other nations because of their beliefs A I's original focus was prisoners of conscience with its remit widening in the 1970 s under the leadership of Se n Mac Bride and Martin Enna ls to include miscarriages of justice and torture In 1977 it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize In the 1980 s its secretary general was Thomas Hamm a rberg succeeded in the 1990 s by Pierre San In the 2000 s it was led by Irene Khan Amnesty International is an international human rights organisation that campaigns worldwide to protect individuals ' and groups ' rights It conducts research and runs information and education efforts to highlight violations 8 Amnesty International was founded in London in July 1961 by English barrister Peter Be nen son who had previously been a founding member of the UK law reform organization JUSTICE 9 Be nen son was influenced by his friend Louis Blom Cooper who led a political prisoners ' campaign 10 11 According to Be nen son's own account he was travelling on the London Underground on 19 November 1960 when he read that two Portuguese students from Coimbra had been sentenced to seven years of imprisonment in Portugal for allegedly having drunk a toast to liberty a 12 Researchers have never traced the alleged newspaper article in question a In 1960 Portugal was ruled by the Estado Novo government of Ant nio de Oliveira Salazar 13 The government was authoritarian in nature and strongly anti communist suppressing enemies of the state as anti Portuguese In his significant newspaper article The Forgotten Prisoners Be nen son later described his reaction as follows Open your newspaper any day of the week and you will find a story from somewhere of someone being imprisoned tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government The newspaper reader feels a sickening sense of impotence Yet if these feelings of disgust could be united into common action something effective could be done 7 Be nen son worked with his friend Eric Baker a member of the Religious Society of Friends who had been involved in funding the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament as well as becoming head of Quaker Peace and Social Witness In his memoirs Be nen son described him as a partner in the launching of the project 14 In consultation with other writers academics and lawyers and in particular Alec Digg es they wrote via Louis Blom Cooper to David Astor editor of The Observer newspaper who on 28 May 1961 published Be nen son's article The Forgotten Prisoners The article brought the reader's attention to those imprisoned tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government 7 or put another way to violations by governments of articles 18 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights UDHR The article described these violations occurring on a global scale in the context of restrictions to press freedom to political oppositions to timely public trial before impartial courts and to asylum It marked the launch of Appeal for Amnesty 1961 the aim of which was to mobilize public opinion quickly and widely in defence of these individuals whom Be nen son named Prisoners of Conscience 15 The Appeal for Amnesty was reprinted by a large number of international newspapers In the same year Be nen son had a book published Persecution 1961 which detailed the cases of nine prisoners of conscience investigated and compiled by Be nen son and Baker Maurice Aud in Ashton Jones Agostinho Neto Patrick Duncan Olga Ivins kaya Luis Tar uc Constantin No ica Antonio Am at and Hu Feng 15 In July 1961 the leadership had decided that the appeal would form the basis of a permanent organization Amnesty with the first meeting taking place in London Be nen son ensured that all three major political parties were represented enlisting members of parliament from the Labour Party the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party 16 On 30 September 1962 it was officially named Amnesty International Between the Appeal for Amnesty 1961 and September 1962 the organization had been known simply as Amnesty 17 By the mid 1960 s Amnesty International's global presence was growing and an International Secretariat and International Executive Committee were established to manage Amnesty International's national organizations called Sections which had appeared in several countries They were secretly supported by the British government at the time 18 The international movement was starting to agree on its core principles and techniques For example the issue of whether or not to adopt prisoners who had advocated violence like Nelson Mandela brought unanimous agreement that it could not give the name of Prisoner of Conscience to such prisoners Aside from the work of the library and groups Amnesty International's activities were expanding to helping prisoners ' families sending observers to trials making representations to governments and finding asylum or overseas employment for prisoners Its activity and influence were also increasing within intergovernmental organizations it would be awarded consultative status by the United Nations the Council of Europe and UNESCO before the decade ended 19 In 1966 Be nen son suspected that the British government in collusion with some Amnesty employees had suppressed a report on British atrocities in Aden 20 He began to suspect that many of his colleagues were part of a British intelligence conspiracy to subvert Amnesty but he could not convince anybody else at A I 21 Later in the same year there were further allegations when the US government reported that Se n Mac Bride the former Irish foreign minister and Amnesty's first chairman had been involved with a Central Intelligence Agency funding operation 20 Mac Bride denied knowledge of the funding but Be nen son became convinced that Mac Bride was a member of a CIA network 21 Be nen son resigned as Amnesty's president on the grounds that it was bugged and infiltrated by the secret services and said that he could no longer live in a country where such activities were tolerated 18 See Relationship with the British Government Amnesty International's membership increased from 15 000 in 1969 22 to 200 000 by 1979 23 At the intergovernmental level Amnesty International pressed for the application of the UN's Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and of existing humanitarian conventions to secure ratification s of the two UN Covenants on Human Rights in 1976 and was instrumental in obtaining additional instruments and provisions forbidding the practice of maltreatment Consultative status was granted at the Inter American Commission on Human Rights in 1972 24 Amnesty International established its Japan chapter in 1970 in part a response to the Republic of China Taiwan 's arrest and prosecution of Chen Yu hsi whom the Taiwan Garrison Command had alleged committed sedition by reading communist literature while studying in the United States 25 101 104 In 1976 Amnesty's British Section started a series of fund raising events that came to be known as The Secret Policeman's Balls series They were staged in London initially as comedy galas featuring what The Daily Telegraph called the cr me de la cr me of the British comedy world 26 including members of comedy troupe Monty Python and later expanded to also include performances by leading rock musicians The series was created and developed by Monty Python alumnus John Cleese and entertainment industry executive Martin Lewis working closely with Amnesty staff members Peter Lu ff assistant director of Amnesty 1974 1978 and subsequently with Peter Walker Amnesty Fund Raising Officer 1978 1982 Cleese Lewis and Lu ff worked together on the first two shows 1976 and 1977 Cleese Lewis and Walker worked together on the 1979 and 1981 shows the first to carry what The Daily Telegraph described as the rather brilliantly re christened Secret Policeman's Ball title 26 The organization was awarded the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize for its defence of human dignity against torture 27 and the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights in 1978 28 During the mid to late 1980 s Amnesty organized two major musical events took place to increase awareness of Amnesty and of human rights The 1986 Conspiracy of Hope tour which played five concerts in the US and culminated in a day long show featuring some thirty odd acts at Giants Stadium and the 1988 Human Rights Now world tour Human Rights Now which was timed to coincide with the 40 th anniversary of the United Nations ' Universal Declaration of Human Rights UDHR played a series of concerts on five continents over six weeks Both tours featured some of the most famous musicians and bands of the day citation needed Throughout the 1990 s Amnesty continued to grow to a membership of over seven million in over 150 countries and territories 3 led by Senegalese Secretary General Pierre San At the intergovernmental level Amnesty International argued in favour of creating a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights established 1993 and an International Criminal Court established 2002 citation needed Amnesty continued to work on a wide range of issues and world events For example South African groups joined in 1992 and hosted a visit by Pierre San to meet with the apartheid government to press for an investigation into allegations of police abuse an end to arms sales to the African Great Lakes region and the abolition of the death penalty In particular Amnesty International brought attention to violations committed on specific groups including refugees racial ethnic religious minorities women and those executed or on Death Row 29 In 1995 when A I wanted to promote how Shell Oil Company was involved with the execution of an environmental and human rights activist Ken Saro Wi wain Nigeria it was stopped Newspapers and advertising companies refused to run A I's ads because Shell Oil was a customer of their s as well Shell's main argument was that it was drilling oil in a country that already violated human rights and had no way to enforce human rights policies To combat the buzz that A I was trying to create it immediately publicized how Shell was helping to improve overall life in Nigeria S a lil Shetty the director of Amnesty said Social media re en erg is es the idea of the global citizen 16 James M Russell notes how the drive for profit from private media sources conflicts with the stories that A I wants to be heard 30 Amnesty International became involved in the legal battle over Augusto Pinochet former Chilean dictator who sought to avoid extradition to Spain to face charges after his arrest in London in 1998 by the Metropolitan Police Lord Hoffman had an indirect connection with Amnesty International and this led to an important test for the appearance of bias in legal proceedings in UK law There was a suit 31 against the decision to release Senator Pinochet taken by the then British Home Secretary Jack Straw before that decision had actually been taken in an attempt to prevent the release of Senator Pinochet The English High Court refused 32 the application and Senator Pinochet was released and returned to Chile After 2000 Amnesty International's primary focus turned to the challenges arising from globalization and the reaction to the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States The issue of globalization provoked a major shift in Amnesty International policy as the scope of its work was widened to include economic social and cultural rights an area that it had declined to work on in the past Amnesty International felt this shift was important not just to give credence to its principle of the indivisibility of rights but because of what it saw as the growing power of companies and the undermining of many nation states as a result of globalization 33 In the aftermath of 11 September attacks the new Amnesty International Secretary General Irene Khan reported that a senior government official had said to Amnesty International delegates Your role collapsed with the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York 34 In the years following the attacks some who believe that the gains made by human rights organizations over previous decades had possibly been eroded 35 Amnesty International argued that human rights were the basis for the security of all not a barrier to it Criticism came directly from the Bush administration and The Washington Post when Khan in 2005 likened the US government's detention facility at Guantanamo Bay Cuba to a Soviet Gulag 36 37 During the first half of the new decade Amnesty International turned its attention to violence against women controls on the world arms trade concerns surrounding the effectiveness of the UN and ending torture 38 With its membership close to two million by 2005 39 Amnesty continued to work for prisoners of conscience In 2007 A I's executive committee decided to support access to abortion within reasonable gestation al limits for women in cases of rape incest or violence or where the pregnancy jeopardizes a mother's life or health 40 Amnesty International reported concerning the Iraq War on 17 March 2008 that despite claims the security situation in Iraq has improved in recent months the human rights situation is disastrous after the start of the war five years earlier in 2003 41 In 2009 Amnesty International accused Israel and the Palestinian Hamas movement of committing war crimes during Israel's January offensive in Gaza called Operation Cast Lead that resulted in the deaths of more than 1 400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis 42 The 117 page Amnesty report charged Israeli forces with killing hundreds of civilians and want on destruction of thousands of homes Amnesty found evidence of Israeli soldiers using Palestinian civilians as human shields A subsequent United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict was carried out Amnesty stated that its findings were consistent with those of Amnesty's own field investigation and called on the UN to act promptly to implement the mission's recommendations 43 44 In February 2010 Amnesty suspended Gita Sah gal its gender unit head after she criticized Amnesty for its links with Moa zz am Begg director of Cage prisoners She said it was a gross error of judgment to work with Britain's most famous supporter of the Taliban 45 46 Amnesty responded that Sah gal was not suspended for raising these issues internally Begg speaks about his own views not Amnesty International's 47 Among those who spoke up for Sah gal were Salman Rushdie 48 Member of Parliament Denis Mac Shane Joan Smith Christopher Hitchens Martin Bright Melanie Phillips and Nick Cohen 46 49

sent a 13 person contingent of human rights activists to seek meetings with officials as well as to train local activists in non violent protest methods 57 This was the first time that the organization has deployed such a team to the United States 58 59 60 In the 2015 annual Amnesty International UK conference delegates narrowly voted 468 votes to 461 against a motion proposing a campaign against antisemitism in the UK The debate on the motion formed a consensus that Amnesty should fight discrimination against all ethnic and religious groups but the division among delegates was over the issue of whether it would be appropriate for an anti racism campaign with a single focus 61 62 The Jewish Chronicle noted that Amnesty International had previously published a report on discrimination against Muslims in Europe 63 In August 2015 The Times reported that Yasmin Hussein then Amnesty's director of faith and human rights and previously its head of international advocacy and a prominent representative at the United Nations had undeclared private links to men alleged to be key players in a secretive network of global Islamists including the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas 64 65 The Times also detailed instances where Hussein was alleged to have had inappropriately close relationships with the al Qa zz az family members of which were high ranking government ministers in the administration of Mohammed Mors i and Muslim Brotherhood leaders at the time 64 65 Ms Hussein denied supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and told Amnesty that any connections are purely circumstantial 64 In June 2016 Amnesty International called on the United Nations General Assembly to immediately suspend Saudi Arabia from the UN Human Rights Council 66 67 Richard Bennett head of

organizations and people who question the authority and capabilities of government leaders A a kar Patel the executive director of the Indian branch claimed The Enforcement Directorate's raid on our office today shows how the authorities are now treating human rights organizations like criminal enterprises using heavy handed methods On Sep 29 the Ministry of Home Affairs said Amnesty International using glossy statements about humanitarian work etc as a ploy to divert attention from their activities which were in clear contravention of laid down Indian laws Amnesty International received permission only once in Dec 2000 since then it had been denied Foreign Contribution permission under the Foreign Contribution Act by successive Governments However in order to circumvent the FC RA regulations Amnesty UK remitted large amounts of money to four entities registered in India by classifying it as Foreign Direct Investment F DI 72 The current Prime Minister of India N are ndra Modi has been criticized by foreign medias for harming civil society in India specifically by targeting advocacy groups 73 74 75 India has cancelled the registration of about 15 000 nongovernmental

had previously accused Israel of the crime against humanity In 2021 Human Rights Watch and B ' tse lem both accused Israel of apartheid for its treatment of the Palestinians in the occupied territories 101 An Amnesty report stated that Israel maintains an institutionalized regime of oppression and domination of the Palestinian population for the benefit of Jewish Israelis 102 The Israeli

Paul O ' Brien the Amnesty International USA Director speaking to a Women's National Democratic Club audience in the US stated We are opposed to the idea and this I think is an existential part of the debate that Israel should be preserved as a state for the Jewish people while adding Amnesty takes no political views on any question including the right of the State of Israel to survive 103 104 105 106 undue weight discuss On 7 April 2022 six weeks after the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine the Russian Ministry of Justice announced that the offices of Amnesty International and 14

Palestinian militants in the territory 108 In January 2025 Amnesty International suspended Amnesty Israel for evidence of endemic anti Palestinian racism within A I Israel within the local branch and its failure to accept the conclusions of Amnesty's reports on Israeli apartheid and the allegations of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza The suspension is set to last for two years while a review panel decides on whether to reinstate the Israel branch or permanently ban it 109 110 In 2025 Amnesty was designated as an undesirable organization in Russia 111 Amnesty International is largely made up of voluntary members but retains a small number of paid professionals In countries in which Amnesty International has a strong presence members are organized as sections In 2019 there were 63 sections worldwide 112 Amnesty International is structured around three main components the Global Assembly the International Board and the International Secretariat The Global Assembly is the movement's highest decision making body bringing together representatives from national sections each year to vote on key strategic issues One of its main roles is to elect the International Board a group of eight members responsible for overseeing the organisation between Global Assembly meetings The International Secretariat led by a Secretary General appointed by the International Board manages the daily operations of the global movement It provides most of Amnesty's research coordinates international campaign strategies and issues urgent actions which are then adapted by national sections 113 In the UK Amnesty International has two components which are registered charities under English law Amnesty International Charity 115 and Amnesty International UK Section Charitable Trust 116 The core principle of Amnesty International is a focus on prisoners of conscience those persons imprisoned or prevented from expressing an opinion by means of violence Along with this commitment to opposing repression of freedom of expression Amnesty International's founding principles included non intervention on political questions a robust commitment to gathering facts about the various cases and promoting human rights 117 One key issue in the principles is in regards to those individuals who may advocate or tacitly support resorting to violence in struggles against repression A I does not judge whether recourse to violence is justified or not However A I does not oppose the political use of violence in itself since The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in its preamble foresees situations in which people could be compelled to have recourse as a last resort to rebellion against tyranny and oppression If a prisoner is serving a sentence imposed after a fair trial for activities involving violence A I will not ask the government to release the prisoner A I neither supports nor condemns the resort to violence by political opposition groups in itself just as A I neither supports nor condemns a government policy of using military force in fighting against armed opposition movements However A I supports minimum humane standards that should be respected by governments and armed opposition groups a like When an opposition group tortures or kills its captives takes hostages or commits deliberate and arbitrary killings A I condemns these abuses 118 dubious discuss Amnesty International considers capital punishment to be the ultimate irreversible denial of human rights and opposes capital punishment in all cases regardless of the crime committed the circumstances surrounding the individual or the method of execution 119 Amnesty International's vision is of a world in which every person enjoys all of the human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights standards In pursuit of this vision Amnesty International's mission is to undertake research and action focused on preventing and ending grave abuses of the rights to physical and mental integrity freedom of conscience and expression and freedom from discrimination within the context of its work to promote all human rights Amnesty International primarily targets governments but also reports on non governmental bodies and private individuals non state actors There are six key areas which Amnesty deals with 120 Some specific aims are to abolish the death penalty 119 end extra judicial executions and disappearances ensure prison conditions meet international human rights standards ensure prompt and fair trial for all political prisoners ensure free education to all children worldwide decriminalize abortion 121 fight impunity from systems of justice end the recruitment and use of child soldiers free all prisoners of conscience promote economic social and cultural rights 122 for marginalized communities protect human rights defenders promote religious tolerance protect LGBT rights 123 124 stop torture and ill treatment 125 stop unlawful killings in armed conflict 126 uphold the rights of refugees 127 migrants and asylum seekers and protect human dignity They also support worldwide de criminal is ation of prostitution 128 Amnesty International launched a free human rights learning mobile application called Amnesty Academy in October 2020 It offered learners across the globe access to courses both online and offline All courses are downloadable within the application which is available for both iOS and Android devices 129 Amnesty reports disproportionately on relatively more democratic and open countries 130 arguing that its intention is not to produce a range of reports which statistically represents the world's human rights abuses but rather to apply the pressure of public opinion to encourage improvements The demonstration effect of the behaviour of both key Western governments and major non Western states is an important factor as one former Amnesty Secretary General pointed out for many countries and a large number of people the United States is a model and according to one Amnesty manager large countries influence small countries 131 In addition with the end of the Cold War Amnesty felt that a greater emphasis on human rights in the North was needed to improve its credibility with its Southern critics by demonstrating its willingness to report on human rights issues in a truly global manner 131 According to one academic study as a result of these considerations the frequency of Amnesty's reports is influenced by a number of factors besides the frequency and severity of human rights abuses For example Amnesty reports significantly more than predicted by human rights abuses on more economically powerful states and on countries that receive US military aid on the basis that this Western complicity in abuses increases the likelihood of public pressure being able to make a difference 131 In addition around 1993 94 Amnesty consciously developed its media relations producing fewer background reports and more press releases to increase the impact of its reports Press releases are partly driven by news coverage to use existing news coverage as leverage to discuss Amnesty's human rights concerns This increases Amnesty's focus on the countries the media is more interested in 131 Amnesty's country focus is similar to that of some other comparable NGOs notably Human Rights Watch between 1991 and 2000 Amnesty and HR W shared eight of ten countries in their top ten by Amnesty press releases 7 for Amnesty reports 131 In addition six of the 10 countries most reported on by Human Rights Watch in the 1990 s also made The Economist's and Newsweek's most covered lists during that time 131 Amnesty International is financed largely by fees and donations from its worldwide membership It says that it does not accept donations from governments or governmental organizations 132 However Amnesty International has received grants over the past ten years from the UK Department for International Development 133 the European Commission 134 the United States State Department 135 136 and other governments 137 138 Amnesty International USA has received funding from the Rockefeller Foundation 139 but these funds are only used in support of its human rights education work 133 It has also received many grants from the Ford Foundation over the years 140 Criticism of Amnesty International includes claims about publishing incorrect reports associating with organizations with a dubious record on human rights protection selection bias ideological and foreign policy bias and the issue of institutional discrimination within the organization 141 Following the suicide of two staff members in 2019 Amnesty launched a review of the workplace culture at the organization The report found an internal toxic work environment including cases of bullying and discrimination 142 Since the report multiple staff members around the world spoke about systemic abuse at Amnesty 143 Numerous governments and their supporters have criticized Amnesty's criticism of their policies including those of Australia 144 Czech Republic 145 China 146 the Democratic Republic of the Congo 147 Egypt 148 India Iran 149 Israel 150 Morocco 151 Nigeria 152 Pakistan 153 154 Qatar 155 Russia 156 Saudi Arabia 157 Thailand 158 Vietnam 159 and the United States 160 for what they assert is one sided reporting or a failure to treat threats to security as a mitigating factor The actions of these governments and of other governments critical of Amnesty International have been the subject of human rights concerns voiced by Amnesty In February 2019 Amnesty International's management team offered to resign after an independent report found what it called a toxic culture of workplace bullying Evidence of bullying harassment sexism and racism was uncovered after two 2018 suicides were investigated that of 30 year Amnesty veteran Ga tan Moo too in Paris in May 2018 and that of 28 year old intern Rosalind McGregor in Geneva in July 2018 83 A 2019 externally commissioned report stated that bullying public humiliation and other abuses of power are commonplace and routine practice by the management It also claimed the us versus them culture among employees and the severe lack of trust in the senior management at Amnesty 161 162 By October 2019 five of the seven members of the senior leadership team at Amnesty's international secretariat left the organization with generous redundancy packages 163 164 After none of the managers responsible of bullying at Amnesty were held accountable a group of workers petitioned for Amnesty's chief Kumi Nai doo to resign On 5 December 2019 Nai doo resigned from his post of Amnesty's Secretary General citing ill health 165 In May 2019 Amnesty International's Secretary General Kumi Nai doo admitted to a hole in the organization's budget of up to 17 m in donor money to the end of 2020 In order to deal with the budgetary crisis Nai doo announced to staff that the organization's headquarters would have cut almost 100 jobs as a part of urgent restructuring Unite the Union the UK's biggest trade union said the redundancies were a direct result of overspending by the organization's senior leadership team and have occurred despite an increase in income 166 Unite which represents Amnesty's staff feared that cuts would fall heaviest on lower income staff It said that in the previous year the top 23 highest earners at Amnesty International were paid a total of 2 6 m an average of 113 000 per year Unite demanded a review of whether it is necessary to have so many managers in the organization 167 Amnesty's budgetary crisis became public after the two staff suicides in 2019 A subsequent independent review of workplace culture found a state of emergency at the organization after a restructuring process Following several reports that labelled Amnesty a toxic workplace in October 2019 five of the seven high paid senior directors at Amnesty's international secretariat in London left the organization with generous redundancy packages 163 This included Anna Ne istat who was a senior manager directly implicated in the independent report on the suicide of Amnesty's West Africa researcher Ga tan Moo too in the organization's Paris office The size of exit packages granted to former senior management caused anger among other staff and an outcry among Amnesty's members 163 and led to the resignation of Nai doo in December 2019 168 In September 2020 The Times reported that Amnesty International paid 800 000 in compensation over the workplace suicide of Ga tan Moo too and demanded his family keep the deal secret 169 The pre trial agreement between London based Amnesty's International Secretariat and Motoo's wife was reached on the condition that she keeps the deal secret by signing NDA This was done particularly to prevent discussing the settlement with the press or on social media The arrangement led to criticism on social media with people asking why an organization such as Amnesty would condone the use of non disclosure agreements Shaista Aziz a co founder of the feminist advocacy group NGO Safe Space questioned on Twitter why the world's leading human rights organisation was employing such contracts 170 The source of the money was unknown Amnesty stated that the pay out to Motoo's family will not be made from donations or membership fees In April 2021 The Guardian reported that the workers of Amnesty International alleged systemic bias and use of racist language by senior staff 171 The internal review at Amnesty's international secretariat the report of which was published in October 2020 but not released to the press recorded multiple examples of alleged racism reported by workers racial slurs systemic bias problematic comments towards religious practices being some of the examples 171 172 The staff at the Amnesty International UK based in London also made claims of racial discrimination 171 The report also documented use of the ethnic slur nigger with any objection from employees about its use being downplayed Vanessa Tse haye the Horn of Africa Campaigner based in the UK has refused to comment as of April 2021 In June 2022 a 106 page independent investigation by the management consultancy firm Global HPO Ltd G HPO concluded that Amnesty International UK A I UK exhibits institutional and systemic racism This report was fully accepted by Amnesty International and Amnesty International UK published the findings of the inquiry in April 2022 173 G HPO's independent investigation found that A I UK has failed to embed principles of anti racism into its own DNA and faces bullying issues within the organisation 174 G HPO's report includes recommendations for improvement actions to be taken by the organization The a lg heme in er reports that A I UK stated it accepted all the recommendations and that the press ' insistence on describing Amnesty as a ' leading human rights group ' is furthermore problematic given the anti Jewish racism that the NGO has displayed for years 175 In 1990 when the United States government was deciding whether or not to invade Iraq a Kuwaiti woman only identified to Congress by the first name Nay i rah testified to congress that when Iraq invaded Kuwait she stayed behind after some of her family left the country She said she was volunteering in a local hospital when Iraqi soldiers stole the incubators with children in them and left them to freeze to death Amnesty International which had human rights investigators in Kuwait confirmed the story and helped spread it among the Western public The organization also inflated the number of children who were killed by the robbery to over 300 more than the number of incubators available in the city hospitals of the country Her testimony aired on ABC's Nightline and NBC Nightly News reaching an estimated audience between 35 and 53 million Americans 176 177 Seven senators cited Nay i rah's testimony in their speeches backing the use of force 180 President George Bush repeated the story at least ten times in the following weeks 181 Her account of the atrocities helped to stir American opinion in favour of participation in the Gulf War 182 It was often cited by people including the members of Congress who voted to approve the Gulf War as one of the reasons to fight After the war it was found that the testimony was entirely fabricated and that Nay i rah was in fact the daughter of a Kuwaiti delegate to America with a leading role in the pro war think tank responsible for organizing the hearing 183 In 2010 Frank Johansson the chairman of Amnesty International Finland called Israel an ilk kim a a a derogatory term variously translated as scum state creep state or punk state 184 185 Johansson stood by his statement saying that it was based on Israel's repeated flouting of international law and his own personal experiences with Israelis When asked by a journalist if any other country on earth that could be described in these terms he said that he could not think of any although some individual Russian officials could be so described 185 In April 2021 Amnesty International distanced itself from a tweet written in 2013 by its new Secretary General Agn s Call a mard which read NY T Interview of Shimon Per res sic where he admits that Yasser Arafat was murdered Amnesty responded by saying The tweet was written in haste and is incorrect It does not reflect the position of Amnesty International or Agn s Call a mard 186 187 188 Call a mard herself has not deleted the tweet 186 On 11 March 2022 Paul O ' Brien the Amnesty International USA Director stated at a private event We are opposed to the idea and this I think is an existential part of the debate that Israel should be preserved as a state for the Jewish people while adding Amnesty takes no political views on any question including the right of the State of Israel to survive 189 190 191 192 He also rejected a poll that found 8 in 10 American Jews were pro Israel saying I believe my gut tells me that what Jewish people in this country want is to know that there's a sanctuary that is a safe and sustainable place that the Jews the Jewish people can call home 189 190 191 On 14 March 2022 all 25 Jewish Democrats in the House of Representatives issued a rare joint statement rebuking O ' Brien saying that he has added his name to the list of those who across centuries have tried to deny and usurp the Jewish people's independent agency and condemning this and any antisemitic attempt to deny the Jewish people control of their own destiny 193 194 195 On 25 March 2022 O ' Brien wrote to the Jewish congressmen I regret representing the views of the Jewish people 194 Amnesty International designated Alexei Naval nya prisoner of conscience in 2012 196 However in February 2021 it stripped Naval ny of the status due to lobbying about videos and pro nationalist statements he made in 2007 2008 that allegedly constituted hate speech 197 198 199 200 Amnesty's decision was described by western media as a huge victory for Russian state propaganda which undermined Amnesty's support of Naval ny's release 201 202 The designation of Naval ny as a prisoner of conscience was reinstated in May 2021 Amnesty apologized for making the decision and stated that by confirming Naval ny's status as prisoner of conscience we are not endorsing his political programme but are highlighting the urgent need for his rights including access to independent medical care to be recognized and acted upon by the Russian authorities 203 204 During the early history of Amnesty International as it is now proven by various documents it was secretly supported by the Foreign Office In 1963 the FO instructed its operatives abroad to provide discreet support for Amnesty's campaigns In the same year Be nen son wrote to Minister of State for the Colonies Lord Lansdowne a proposal to prop up a refugee counsellor on the border between the Bechuanaland Protectorate and apartheid South Africa Amnesty intended to assist people fleeing across the border from neighbouring South Africa but not those who were actively engaged in the struggle against apartheid Be nen son wrote I would like to reiterate our view that these British territories should not be used for offensive political action by the opponents of the South African Government Communist influence should not be allowed to spread in this part of Africa and in the present delicate situation Amnesty International would wish to support Her Majesty's Government in any such policy 18 The year after the A I dropped Nelson Mandela as a prisoner of conscience because he was convicted of violence by the South African Government Mandela had also been a member of the South African Communist Party 205 In a trip to Haiti the British FO had also assisted Be nen son in his mission to Haiti where he was disguised because of fear of the Haitians finding out that the British government sponsored his visit When his disguise was revealed Be nen son was severely criticized by the media 18 In the British colony of Aden Hans Goran Franck the chairman of Amnesty's Swedish section wrote a report on allegations of torture at an interrogation centre run by the colonial government Amnesty refused to publish the report according to Be nen son Amnesty general secretary Robert Swann had suppressed it in deference to the Foreign Office According to co founder Eric Baker both Be nen son and Swann had met Foreign Secretary George Brown in September and told him that they were willing to hold up publication if the Foreign Office promised no more allegations of torture would surface again A memo by Lord Chancellor Gerald Gardiner a Labour Party politician states that Amnesty held the Swedish complaint as long as they could simply because Peter Be nen son did not want to do anything to hurt a Labour government 18 Be nen son then travelled to Aden and reported that he had never seen an uglier situation in his life He then said that British government agents had infiltrated Amnesty and suppress the report's publication Later documents surfaced implicating Be nen son had connections to the British government which started the Harry letters affair 20 18 He then resigned claiming that British and American intelligence agents had infiltrated Amnesty and subverted its values 20 After this set of events which were dubbed by some the Amnesty Crisis of 1966 67 206 the relationship between Amnesty and the British Government was suspended A I vowed that in future it must not only be independent and impartial but must not be put into a position where anything else could even be alleged and the Foreign Office cautioned that for the time being our attitude to Amnesty International must be one of reserve 18 Amnesty International suspended Gita Sah gal its gender unit head after she criticized Amnesty in February 2010 for its high profile associations with Moa zz am Begg the director of Cage prisoners representing men in extra judicial detention 207 208 To be appearing on platforms with Britain's most famous supporter of the Taliban Begg whom we treat as a human rights defender is a gross error of judgment she said 207 209 Sah gal argued that by associating with Begg and Cage prisoners Amnesty was risking its reputation on human rights 207 210 211 As a former Guantanamo detain ee it was legitimate to hear his experiences but as a supporter of the Taliban it was absolutely wrong to legitimize him as a partner Sah gal said 207 She said she repeatedly brought the matter up with Amnesty for two years to no avail 212 A few hours after the article was published Sah gal was suspended from her position 213 Amnesty's Senior Director of Law and Policy Wi d ney Brown later said Sah gal raised concerns about Begg and Cage prisoners to her personally for the first time a few days before sharing them with the Sunday Times 212 Sah gal issued a statement saying she felt that Amnesty was risking its reputation by associating with and there by politically legitimizing Begg because Cage prisoners actively promotes Islamic Right ideas and individuals 213 She said the issue was not about Begg's freedom of opinion nor about his right to propound his views he already exercises these rights fully as he should The issue is the importance of the human rights movement maintaining an objective distance from groups and ideas that are committed to systematic discrimination and fundamentally undermine the universality of human rights 213 The controversy prompted responses by politicians the writer Salman Rushdie and journalist Christopher Hitchens among others who criticized Amnesty's association with Begg After her suspension and the controversy Sah gal was interviewed by numerous media and attracted international supporters She was interviewed on the US National Public Radio NPR on 27 February 2010 where she discussed the activities of Cage prisoners and why she deemed it inappropriate for Amnesty to associate with Begg 214 She said that Cage prisoners ' A sim Qureshi spoke supporting global jihad at a Hizb ut Tah rir rally 214 She stated that a best seller at Begg's bookshop was a book by Abdullah Az zam a mentor of Osama bin Laden and a founder of the terrorist organization Lashkar e Tai ba 212 214 In a separate interview for the Indian Daily News Analysis Sah gal said that as Que re shi affirmed Begg's support for global jihad on a BBC World Service programme these things could have been stated in his Begg's introduction with Amnesty 215 She said that Begg's bookshop had published The Army of Madina h which she characterized as a jihad manual by D hire n Baro t 216 In February 2011 newspaper stories in the UK revealed that Irene Khan had received a payment of 533 103 from Amnesty International following her resignation from the organization on 31 December 2009 217 a fact pointed to from Amnesty's records for the 2009 2010 financial year The sum paid to her was more than four times her annual salary 132 490 217 The deputy secretary general Kate Gilmore who also resigned in December 2009 received an ex gratia payment of 320 000 217 According to the Daily Express Peter Pack the chairman of Amnesty's International Executive Committee IEC initially stated on 19 February 2011 The payments to outgoing secretary general Irene Khan shown in the accounts of A I Amnesty International Ltd for the year ending 31 March 2010 include payments made as part of a confidential agreement between A I Ltd and Irene Khan 218 unreliable source and that It is a term of this agreement that no further comment on it will be made by either party 217 The payment and A I's initial response to its leakage to the press led to a considerable outcry Philip Davies the Conservative MP for Shipley criticized the payments telling the Daily Express I am sure people making donations to Amnesty in the belief they are alleviating poverty never dreamed they were sub sidi sing a fat cat pay out This will disillusion many benefactors 218 unreliable source On 21 February 2011 Peter Pack issued a further statement in which he said that the payment was a unique situation that was in the best interest of Amnesty's work and that there would be no repetition of it 217 He stated that the new secretary general with the full support of the IEC has initiated a process to review our employment policies and procedures to ensure that such a situation does not happen again 217 Pack also stated that Amnesty was fully committed to applying all the resources that we receive from our millions of supporters to the fight for human rights 217 On 25 February 2011 Pack sent a letter to Amnesty members and staff In 2008 it stated the IEC decided not to prolong Khan's contract for a third term In the following months IEC discovered that due to British employment law it had to choose between three options offering Khan a third term discontinuing her post and in their judgement risking legal consequences or signing a confidential agreement and issuing a pay compensation 219 In April 2019 30 Kurdish activists some of whom are on an indefinite hunger strike occupied Amnesty International's building in London in a peaceful protest in order to speak out against Amnesty's silence on the isolation of Abdullah calan in a Turkish prison 220 The hunger strikers have also spoken out about delaying tactics by Amnesty and being denied access to toilets during the occupation despite this being a human right 221 222 Two of the hunger strikers Na hide Zeng in and Mehmet S a it Zeng in received paramedic treatment and were taken to hospital during the occupation Late in the evening of 26 April 2019 the London Met police arrested 21 remaining occupiers 223 On 4 August 2022 during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Amnesty International published a report accusing the Armed Forces of Ukraine of endangering civilians through their combat tactics particularly stating that Ukraine had set up military bases in residential areas including schools and hospitals and launched attacks from populated civilian areas 224 Oksana Pokal ch uk leader of Amnesty Ukraine said that the report was compiled by foreign observers without any assistance from local staff 225 She resigned from her post and left the organization following the publication of the report 226 Human rights lawyers Wayne Jord ash and Anna My ky ten ko argued that the 4 August report contained little to none of the military or humanitarian context essential to any reasoned view of what was or was not necessary in the prevailing military context and that the report was short on facts and analysis and long on intemperate accusation 227 RUS I researcher Jack Watling stated that you need to balance military necessity with proportionality so you need to take reasonable measures to protect civilians but that must be balanced with your orders to defend an area thus the report's suggestions that Ukrainian forces should relocate to a nearby field or forest demonstrated a lack of understanding of military operations and damages the credibility of the research 228 RUS I researcher Nat i a Ses kuri a called the report out of touch with current reality and stated that the Ukrainian army can legitimately house in the towns they defend even if they have civilians nearby because the Ukrainian authorities constantly call for evacuations from frontline towns and forced relocation s of civilian population would violate international humanitarian law 229 Marc Gar las co a United Nations war crimes investigator specializing in civilian harm mitigation said that Ukraine can place forces in areas they are defending and there is no requirement to stand shoulder to shoulder in a field this isn't the 19 th century and expressed concern that the report could endanger Ukrainian civilians by giving Russian forces an excuse to expand their targeting of civilian areas 230 Journalist Tom Mut ch stated that he had participated in and reported on an evacuation of civilians in one of Amnesty's cases which he contrasted with Amnesty's statement that it was not aware that the Ukrainian military who located themselves in civilian structures in residential areas asked or assisted civilians to evacuate nearby buildings 228 The Kyiv Independent editorial team strongly criticized the report pointing out flaws in reasoning and stating that the Amnesty International could not properly articulate who the main perpetrator of violence in Ukraine was 231 The report sparked outrage in Ukraine and the West Ukrainian President Vol o dy myr Ze lensky y accused Amnesty of trying to amnesty the terrorist state and shift the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim while Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs D my tro Ku leb a stated that the report creates a false balance between the oppressor and the victim 230 232 233 The report was praised by several Russian and pro Russian figures including the Russian embassy in London causing further criticism against the organization 234 On 12 August Amnesty International reported that the conclusions were not conveyed with the delicacy and accuracy that should be expected from Amnesty and said that this also applies to the subsequent communication and reaction of the International Secretariat to public criticism The organization condemned the instrument aliz ation of the press release by the Russian authorities and promised that the report will be verified by independent experts 235 236 The criticism resulted in A I calling an internal review committee composed of independent international humanitarian law IHL experts to review the report whose conclusions were not published by A I but nonetheless obtained by New York Times The review concluded that while A I was right to include Ukraine in its analysis in general as IHL applies to all sides of a conflict its conclusions in respect to Ukraine were biased and not sufficiently substantiated by available evidence and the vague language of the report could leave an impression even if this was not intended and not supported by evidence that Ukrainian forces were primarily or equally to blame for the death of civilians resulting from attacks by Russia To the contrary the review concluded that on the basis of the evidence that A I had collected it was simply impossible to assert that generally civilians died as result of negligence of Ukrainian army while imprudent language of the report suggested this 237 In 1977 Amnesty International was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for having contributed to securing the ground for freedom for justice and there by also for peace in the world 238 In 1984 Amnesty International received the Four Freedoms Award in the category of Freedom of Speech 239 A Conspiracy of Hope was a short tour of six benefit concerts on behalf of Amnesty International that took place in the United States during June 1986 The purpose of the tour was not to raise funds but rather to increase awareness of human rights and of Amnesty's work on its 25 th anniversary The shows were headlined byU 2 Sting and Bryan Adams and also featured Peter Gabriel Lou Reed Joan Baez and The Neville Brothers The last three shows featured a reunion of The Police At a press conference in each city at related media events and through their music at the concerts themselves the artists engaged with the public on themes of human rights and human dignity The six concerts were the first of what subsequently became known collectively as the Human Rights Concerts a series of music events and tours staged by Amnesty International USA between 1986 and 1998 Human Rights Now was a worldwide tour of twenty benefit concerts on behalf of Amnesty International that took place over six weeks in 1988 Held not to raise funds but to increase awareness of both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on its 40 th anniversary and the work of Amnesty International the shows featured Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Sting Peter Gabriel Tracy Chapman and You s so u N ' Dour plus guest artists from each of the countries where concerts were held The organization's logo combines two recognizable images inspired by the proverb Better to light a candle than curse the darkness 240 The candle represents the organization's efforts to bring light to the fact that political prisoners are held all over the world and its commitment to bring the prisoners hope for fair treatment and release The barbed wire represents the hopelessness of people unjustly put in jail 241 The logo was designed by Diana Red house in 1963 as Amnesty's first Christmas card 242",
