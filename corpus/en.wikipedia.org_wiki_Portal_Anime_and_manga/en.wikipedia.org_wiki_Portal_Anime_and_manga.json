    "transformers_text": "Portal topics - ( Random portal )\n\nAnime ( アニメ ) refers to animation originating from Japan . It is characterized by distinctive characters and backgrounds ( hand-drawn or computer-generated ) that visually and thematically set it apart from other forms of animation. Storylines may include a variety of fictional or historical characters, events, and settings. Anime is aimed at a broad range of audiences; consequently, a given series may have aspects of a range of genres . Anime is most frequently distributed by streaming services , broadcast on television , or sold on DVDs and other media, either after their broadcast run or directly as original video animation (OVA). Console and computer games sometimes also feature segments or scenes that can be considered anime.\n\nManga ( 漫画 ) , Japanese for \" comics \" or \" whimsical pictures \", are comics or graphic novels originating from Japan. Manga developed from a mixture of ukiyo-e and Western styles of drawing , and took its current form shortly after World War II . Manga, apart from covers, is usually published in black and white but it is common to find introductions to chapters to be in color and read from top to bottom and then right to left, similar to the layout of Japanese plain text. Financially, manga represented 2005 a market of ¥24 billion in Japan and $180 million in the United States. Manga was the fastest-growing segment of books in the United States in 2005. In 2020, Japan's manga industry hit a value of ¥612.6 billion due to the fast growth of the digital manga market, while manga sales in North America reached an all-time high of almost $250 million.\n\nAnime and manga have a shared iconography , including exaggerating the scale of physical features, to which the reader presumably should pay most attention; the best known being \"large eyes\". Manga are often adapted into anime, usually with the collaboration of the original author . Light novel series and video games can also be adapted into anime or manga. In such cases, the work's original story is often compressed or modified to fit the new format and appeal to a wider demographic. Popular franchises sometimes include full-length feature films , both animated and live-action , as well as live-action television programs.\n\nLast Exile ( ラストエグザイル , Rasuto Eguzairu ) is a Japanese anime television series created by Gonzo . It featured a production team led by director Koichi Chigira , character designer Range Murata , and production designer Mahiro Maeda . The three had previously worked together in Blue Submarine No. 6 , one of the first CG anime series. It aired on TV Tokyo from April to September 2003. A sequel series, Last Exile: Fam, the Silver Wing ( ラストエグザイル～銀翼のファム～ , Rasuto Eguzairu Gin'yoku no Famu ) , aired from October 2011 to March 2012. A film adaptation of the series, Last Exile: Fam, the Silver Wing: Over the Wishes , was released in February 2016.\n\nThe story is set on the fictional world of Prester, where its inhabitants use aerial vehicles known as vanships as a means of transportation. On this world, which is divided in eternal conflict between the nations of Anatoray and Disith, sky couriers Claus Valca and Lavie Head must deliver a girl who holds the key to uniting the two factions. Although Prester itself is not a representation of Earth, it features technology reminiscent of nineteenth century Europe at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution . Many of its designs were also inspired by Germany's technological advances during the interwar period .\n\nThe episodes of the 2008 Japanese animated television series True Tears are directed by Junji Nishimura and produced by P.A. Works , Lantis , and Bandai Visual . P.A. Works produced the animation and Lantis was responsible for the production of the music. The anime, while sharing its title with the visual novel by La'cryma , has no relation to the visual novel; however, La'cryma is credited as the series' original creator. The story follows Shinichirō Nakagami , a high school student, who is unable to express his feelings for Hiromi Yuasa , a fellow high school student who was taken in by Shinichirō's parents after her father died, as well as his interactions with another student, Noe Isurugi , who enlists Shinichirō's aid in recovering her \"tears.\"\n\nThe episodes aired from January 6, 2008 to March 29, 2008 on TV Kanagawa in Japan, although a special preview of the first episode was shown in Japan on January 4, 2008 on BS11 Digital. The title for a given episode is a line spoken within the episode. A DVD compilation, containing the first two episodes of the anime, was released by Bandai Visual on March 25, 2008. Four more DVD compilations, each containing two episodes, was released between April 25, 2008, and July 25, 2008 respectively ( Full list... )\n\nDecember 3 :\n\nFilm releases\n\nOVA / ONA series\n\nTelevision series and specials\n\nHistory · Industry ( Voice acting · Companies ) · Original video animation · Original net animation · Fansub · Fandub · Lists\n\nHistory · Publishers · International market · Iconography · Dōjinshi · Alternative · Gekiga · Yonkoma · Scanlation · Lists\n\nDemographic groups ( Children · Shōnen · Shōjo · Seinen · Josei ) · Genres ( Cooking · Erotic ( Bara · Yaoi · Yuri ) · Harem · Isekai · Magical girl · Mecha · Sports · Others ) Other Names in Countries (( South Korea )) Manhwa Western Comics (( China )) Manhua\n\nGlossary ( Ecchi · Hentai · Moe ) · Anime-influenced animation · 2.5D musical\n\nThe following Wikimedia Foundation sister projects provide more on this subject:\n\nThe following Wikimedia Foundation sister projects provide more on this subject:",
