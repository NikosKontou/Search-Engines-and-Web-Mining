    "transformers_text": "Portal topics - ( Random portal )\n\nThe 1990s (pronounced \"nineteen-nineties\"; shortened to \"the ' 90s \") was a decade of the Gregorian calendar that began on 1 January 1990, and ended on 31 December 1999.\n\nCulturally, the 1990s are characterized by the rise of multiculturalism and alternative media , which continues into the present day. Movements such as hip hop , the rave scene and grunge spread around the world to young people during that decade, aided by then-new technology such as cable television and the World Wide Web .\n\nIn the absence of world communism , which collapsed in the first two years of the decade, the 1990s was politically defined by a movement towards the right-wing , including increase in support for far-right parties in Europe [ 1 ] as well as the advent of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party [ 2 ] and cuts in social spending in the United States, [ 3 ] Canada, [ 4 ] New Zealand, [ 5 ] and the UK. [ 6 ] The United States also saw a massive revival in the use of the death penalty in the 1990s, which reversed in the early 21st century. [ 7 ] During the 1990s the character of the European Union and Euro were formed and codified in treaties .\n\nA combination of factors, including the continued mass mobilization of capital markets through neo-liberalism , the thawing of the decades-long Cold War , the beginning of the widespread proliferation of new media such as the Internet from the middle of the decade onwards, increasing skepticism towards government , and the dissolution of the Soviet Union led to a realignment and reconsolidation of economic and political power across the world and within countries. The dot-com bubble of 1997–2000 brought wealth to some entrepreneurs before its crash between 2000 and 2001.\n\nThe 1990s saw extreme advances in technology, with the World Wide Web , the first gene therapy trial, and the first designer babies [ 8 ] all emerging in 1990 and being improved and built upon throughout the decade.\n\nNew ethnic conflicts emerged in Africa, the Balkans , and the Caucasus , the former two which led to the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides , respectively. Signs of any resolution of tensions between Israel and the Arab world remained elusive despite the progress of the Oslo Accords , though The Troubles in Northern Ireland came to a standstill in 1998 with the Good Friday Agreement after 30 years of violence. [ 9 ]\n\nSoundgarden was an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington , in 1984 by singer and drummer Chris Cornell , lead guitarist Kim Thayil , and bassist Hiro Yamamoto . Cornell switched to rhythm guitar in 1985, replaced on drums initially by Scott Sundquist, and later by Matt Cameron in 1986. Yamamoto left in 1989 and was replaced initially by Jason Everman and shortly thereafter by Ben Shepherd . Soundgarden disbanded in 1997 and reformed in 2010. Following Cornell's death in 2017, Thayil declared in October 2018 that Soundgarden had disbanded a second time. The surviving members of the band have continued to occasionally work together since then, including reuniting for a one-off concert in tribute to Cornell in January 2019, and again in December 2024 for a benefit concert in Seattle, with Shaina Shepherd on vocals, under the anagram Nudedragons .\n\nSoundgarden was one of the pioneers of grunge music, a style of alternative rock that developed in the American Pacific Northwest in the mid-1980s, and helped to popularize it in the early 1990s, alongside such Seattle contemporaries as Alice in Chains , Pearl Jam , and Nirvana . They were the first of a number of grunge bands to sign to the Seattle-based record label Sub Pop , through which they released two EPs : Screaming Life (1987) and Fopp (1988). Soundgarden's debut album, Ultramega OK , was also released in 1988 by the Los Angeles -based independent label SST Records ; although the album did not sell well nationally, it garnered critical acclaim and the band's first Grammy Award nomination. Soundgarden was the first grunge band to be signed to a major label when they signed to A&M Records in 1988. The release of their second album, Louder Than Love (1989), was the band's first album to enter the Billboard 200 chart, peaking at number 108, and spawned two radio hits: \" Hands All Over \" and \" Loud Love \".
