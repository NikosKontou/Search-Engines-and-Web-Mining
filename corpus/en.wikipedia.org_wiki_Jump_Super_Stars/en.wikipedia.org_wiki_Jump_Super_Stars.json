    "transformers_text": "Jump Super Stars [ a ] is a 2D crossover fighting game for the Nintendo DS , based on Weekly Shōnen Jump characters. It was developed by Ganbarion and published by Nintendo . The game was released on August 8, 2005, in Japan and accompanied the release of a red Nintendo DS . A sequel , Jump Ultimate Stars , was released in Japan on November 23, 2006.\n\nJump Super Stars features characters from the Japanese manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump . The game supports 2-4 players in multiplayer and features over 75 missions.\n\nKoma (panel) is the term for the characters that the player can use in the game. Each koma uses from 1 to 7 squares of the koma deck at the bottom screen of the Nintendo DS . The deck has 20 squares (4 x 5) for the player to place their koma.\n\nThere are three types of koma: help koma, support koma and battle koma.\n\nThe player can build and store up to ten koma decks, and each deck must have at least one help koma, one support koma and one battle koma to be valid for use in battle. There are also a set of predefined decks that the player can use, but the player cannot change or delete those. It is also possible to exchange decks between friends, but they won't be able to edit the decks.\n\nAlly boosting is done by placing koma next to each other in the deck maker. If the koma placed next to each other are \"compatible\", their attributes will go up. Battle characters can get a longer health bar, or increase the maximum number of special attack gauges.\n\nThis is a list of represented series in Jump Super Stars .
