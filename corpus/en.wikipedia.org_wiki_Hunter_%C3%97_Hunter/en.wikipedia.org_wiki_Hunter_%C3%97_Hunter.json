America volumes 23 through 27 have ranked within the top 300 best selling graphics novels list of sales estimates by Diamond Comic Distributors 179 180 181 182 183 Hunter Hunter has received much praise for its plot and characters In his 2007 book Manga The Complete Guide Jason Thompson described its storyline as an almost random collection of psych out s battles puzzles and trickery that works on both a chapter by chapter basis and a larger scale Thompson elaborated that with all the goals and subplots of each of the main characters the story could seemingly go on forever and is unpredictable enough to hold the reader's interest 20 In a different review for Anime News Network in 2012 Thompson wrote that it was hard to summarize the story because it is every sh nen manga in one with training sequences tournament battles a crime mystery story arc and a virtual reality RPG style story arc But unlike most sh nen manga he called Hunter Hunter incredibly dense Examples provided by Thompson include its fictional Nen ability which he said was explained so thoroughly that you almost think it could exist and the challenges and games the characters face Over and over Togas hi invents some little closed system or rules just so the heroes can break them if he ever wants to change careers I'd suggest game designer Thompson praised the character art as great pointing out how instead of alternating between realistic and chibi like other artists Togas hi had cartoon y and realistically designed characters interacting in the same panels Thompson noted how the artwork during its magazine run was often sketchy and missing backgrounds but that Togas hi went back and fixed it for its collected tank bon release Mentioning Togas hi's love of gore he stated the whole manga is about the mixture of childish adventure and creepy adult themes and noted how some panels later in the manga apparently censor the gore by covering it with screen tone 184 Reviewing the first story arc Chris Sims of Comics Alliance called Hunter Hunter one of the most fun ridiculous and ludicrously violent comics I've ever read He stated that while it has every sh nen manga idea in force what stuck out the most is the violence Sims summed it up as full of clever setups and characters that while simple to the point of almost seeming one dimensional at times still manage to be solid and entertaining based on their reaction to the increasingly strange increasingly deadly events around them 185 Charles Solomon a writer for The New York Times and Los Angeles Times praised the moral seriousness of Gon a quality that gave the protagonist an appeal his relentlessly upbeat counterparts lack 186 187 Publishers Weekly gave a positive review to the first volume of the manga stating that Togas hi shows a deft touch with its standard story calling his artwork clear and graceful and mentioning that his characters are endearing and complex 188 While Rika Takahashi of EX org and Claude J Pelle tier of Proto culture Addicts found the art style in Hunter Hunter to be much simpler than Togas hi's two previous manga series Level E and YuYu Hakusho both reviewers praised the intricate narrative and characters 12 5 The first Hunter Hunter anime series enjoyed much more modest popularity than the manga Newtype listed it as having a Japanese television rating of 10 5 for the fourth quarter of 2000 189 The s how's viewership was ranked number six among the top ten anime television series in Japan for February 2001 190 The series was voted as the 16 th best anime of 2000 in the Anime Grand Prix and rose to fourth place the following year 191 192 In 2001 the staff of the magazine listed Hunter Hunter as the 94 th most important anime of all time 193 In a 2006 web poll conducted in Japan by the network TV Asahi the Hunter Hunter television series was voted 28 th best anime of all time 194 In 2010 Mania com's Brian a Lawrence listed Hunter Hunter at number nine on the website's 10 Anime Series That Need a Reboot 195 Critical reception for the first Hunter Hunter television adaptation has been generally favorable Miya ko Matsuda of Proto culture Addicts Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network and Derrick L Tucker of THEM Anime Reviews all expressed positive views of the series ' narrative and characters 5 77 196 Matsuda admired the adventure filled world of Hunter Hunter and the practical character qualities of friendship effort and victory inserted by Togas hi 5 Beginning with the second Viz DVD volume Kimlinger summarized Togas hi's plotting is canny and occasionally insightful and Fur u hashi's visuals inventive yet attuned to the measured pacing of the series Together they create a shonen action series that is both fun to watch and curiously respectful of its audience's intelligence A strange combination indeed 77 Tucker admitted to being bewitched by the series mainly due to the remarkable and original characters especially the interplay between the vastly different personalities of the Phantom Troupe members 196 Kimlinger gave particular praise to the characteristics of the complex villain His oka and the deep emotional transformation of Kura pika in the latter half of the series 14 15 77 In a review for Anime News Network Theron Martin found the initial fifteen episodes entertaining He commended the series for its clever writing and a twist where a tournament official is held accountable for their unfair actions Martin also noted that the protagonist Gon possesses an innate li k ability reminiscent of Goku's character 13 The art and animation of the Hunter Hunter anime have also been commended by the press Kimlinger and Tucker were impressed by the art direction of Hunter Hunter the former of whom critiquing the adaptation of Togas hi's work by Fur u hashi as having understated energy and flair making the most of the era's 1999 mix of traditional and CG animation to bring Gon and friends ' physical feats to fluid exhilarating life 77 196 Martin faulted both the artwork and the subtle differences in character design The artistry not only shows its age but in fact looks older than it actually is the reviewer commented hearkening back to a day when digital coloring and CG enhancements were not ubiquitous and allowances for a rougher look were greater Opinions of the series ' sound and music have been somewhat mixed Martin positively noted the soundtrack as the strongest production point of Hunter Hunter and was satisfied with both the English translation of the script and Ocean's voice over s 13 Tucker found the music satisfactory and improved as the series progressed but did not think it lived up to its potential 196 Kimlinger agreeably felt the musical score to be appropriate in most instances but criticized the English dub as a letdown since day one 14 15 A second Hunter Hunter anime adaptation produced by Madhouse premiered in October 2011 adaptation and was met with near universal critical acclaim Adrian Marca no from Inverse considered the 2011 series to be one of the greatest anime series ever He said that the anime set itself apart with one of the greatest story arcs in anime history in which the villain not the hero takes the anime to instant classic status He also said that It is in the 2011 version where we see probably one of the best story arcs in anime history the Chimera Ant Arc 197 Nick Creamer held similar sentiments writing the s how's fantastic aesthetics elevate it above almost everything out there in direction in sound design in pacing in animation in basically every relevant aesthetic metric Hunter x Hunter triumphs That it's been maintaining this level of quality for well over a hundred episodes is nothing short of astonishing 198 In 2019 Polygon named the series as one of the best anime of the 2010 s 199 and Crunchy roll ranked it as one of the 25 best anime of the 2010 s 200 IGN also listed the Hunter Hunter 2011 adaptation among the best anime series of the 2010 s 201",
