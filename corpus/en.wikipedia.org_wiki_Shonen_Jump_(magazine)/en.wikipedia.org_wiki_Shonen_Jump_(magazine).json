    "transformers_text": "Shonen Jump officially stylized SHONEN JUMP and abbreviated SJ was ash nen manga anthology published in North America by Viz Media It debuted in November 2002 with the first issue having a January 2003 cover date Based on Shueisha's popular Japanese magazine Weekly Sh nen Jump Shonen Jump was retooled for English readers and the American audience including changing it from a weekly publication to a monthly one It featured serialized chapters from different manga series and articles on Japanese language and culture as well as manga anime video games and figurines The premiere issue of Shonen Jump also introduced the first official English translations of One Piece S and Land Yu Gi Oh YuYu Hakusho and Naruto Prior to the magazine's launch Viz launched an extensive marketing campaign to promote it and help it succeed where previous manga anthologies published in North America had failed Shueisha purchased an equity interest in Viz to help fund the venture and Cartoon Network Suncoast and Diamond Distributors became promotional partners in the magazine In conjunction with the magazine Viz launched new imprints for releasing media related to the series presented in the magazine and other sh nen works This includes two new manga imprints an anime DVD imprint a fiction line for releasing light novels a label for fan and data books and a label for the release of art books Targeted towards young adult males the first issue required three printings to meet consumer demand with over 300 000 copies sold It was awarded the I Cv 2 Comic Product of the Year award in December 2002 and it continued to enjoy high sales with a monthly circulation of 215 000 in 2008 Approximately half of its circulation came from subscriptions rather than store sales After the end of its physical circulation sealed poly bagged issues of Shonen Jump are now considered highly sought after among fans and comic book collectors Shonen Jump published its final issue in April 2012 when Viz decided to focus on a weekly digital manga anthology Weekly Shonen Jump initially named Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha launched in January 2012 Based on Shueisha's popular Japanese magazine Weekly Sh nen Jump Weekly Shonen Jump is an attempt to provide English readers with easily accessible affordable and officially licensed editions of the latest installments of popular Sh nen Jump manga soon after their release in Japan as an alternative to popular bootleg scanlation services Viz Media published its final digital issue of Weekly Shonen Jump and launched the Shonen Jump digital vault on December 10 2018 providing access to a limited number of free digital chapters and a subscription service to access their back catalogue of Shonen Jump titles 2 A global version of Shonen Jump was also launched on January 28 2019 called Manga Plus by Shueisha 3 In June 2002 Viz Media at the time called Viz Communications and Shueisha announced that Viz would begin publishing Shonen Jump an English spin on Shueisha's highly popular manga anthology Weekly Sh nen Jump Cartoon Network Suncoast and Diamond Distributors signed on as promotional partners 4 Though based on Weekly Sh nen Jump Viz noted that it would not be a word for word copy Rather Viz would select series for its magazine that it felt were the most appropriate for its American readers 5 Viz's version was also set to be monthly rather than weekly to better fit the American comic distribution system 6 We will be selecting the material most appropriate for the American market Bear in mind that Shonen Jump has been running since 1968 in Japan At 500 pages a week that gives us 884 000 pages of material to draw from Our lead titles are Dragon Ball Zand Yu Gi Oh selected for their already existing popularity in the US The remainder of the titles will be a combination of those on the verge of breaking out in this country and those we feel will especially appeal to the target demographic Renee So lberg Viz Marketing Manager I Cv 2 5 Jason Thompson one of Viz's manga editors for series including Dragon Ball was selected as the magazine's first editor in chief 7 Initially Viz hoped to have the magazine targeted to all age groups however to allow for greater freedom in content the decision was made to mark the magazine as being for readers 13 years of age and older However with greater attention being focused on manga as it became available in mainstream outlets some titles were edited for content Thompson noted that it was a challenge working with some of the artists whose works would appear in the first issue who worried about excessive alterations 7 With manga anthologies having met with little success in North America Viz desired Shonen Jump to have a circulation of 1 million within its first three years To aid in this goal Viz launched the magazine with a multi million dollar advertising budget they advertised and distributed the title through mass market outlets rather than just pop culture stores ensuring the magazine included series already popular with the North American audience due to their airing on Cartoon Network 4 To help fund the lengthy expensive marketing campaign developed around Shonen Jump Shueisha purchased an equity interest in Viz in August 2002 8 Unlike with most magazine launches Viz decided to allow retailers to return the first two issues This gave retailers a chance to see how well the magazine would sell in markets where manga anthologies were an unknown Retailers were also given a quantity of free samples distributed 100 000 free samples at Comic Con and another 100 000 were made available to its partner Suncoast 9 Cartoon Network began providing sample chapters and streaming video content to its Adult Swim website along with prominent links to Shonen Jump's official site 8 The first issue was released November 26 2002 with a January 2003 cover date It premiered with five series Dragon Ball Z S and Land Yu Gi Oh YuYu Hakusho and One Piece 10 11 12 With the launch of the magazine considered successful Thompson was offered an opportunity to intern in Japan with Shueisha's editors but declined due to a lack of interest in the management aspects of the business and a desire to work on his own projects 7 After six issues had been released Thompson desired to work on authoring and illustrating his own comic The Stiff Reflecting back later he states in an interview with The Comics Journal that I basically told Viz that I wanted to work part time or I'd quit It probably wasn't a really nice thing to do 13 He eventually stepped down as editor in chief being replaced by his former boss Yumi Ho a shi 13 14 In February 2005 Viz announced the creation of Sho jo Beat a sister publication of Shonen Jump geared towards female readers The first issue was released in June 2005 with a July 2005 date cover it ran for 47 issues until it was discontinued with the release of the July 2009 issue 15 16 In 2006 Marc Weiden baum was named as the Editor in Chief for both magazines 14 Weiden baum remained the magazine's editor until February 13 2009 when Viz announced that he had left the company the magazine's new editor in chief has not been named 17 As of the June 2011 issue only 10 issues were published in a year The magazine is printed at Trans cont intent al Printing RB W Graphics in Owen Sound Ontario Canada In October 2011 Viz announced that Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha a weekly digital version of the magazine would be made available to the public beginning on January 30 2012 Viz also released its final Shonen Jump print publication in March of that year after Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha was released 1 18 The bulk of each issue of Shonen Jump is composed of chapters from the seven manga titles currently in serialization 19 Each issue also includes product reviews for anime and manga related games and toys articles on Japanese language and culture interviews with manga artists anime and manga related news fan related sections such as fan art and letters from readers and interactive games and trivia sections 19 Issues also regularly include free premiums such as rare cards

Weekly Sh nen Jump special edition stand alone issues of Shonen Jump are released several times a year that focus on a manga series These issues which are considered collector's items include extensive details on the series plot and characters information on related adaptations of the series and free premium items such as full size posters 19 Anniversary editions are released yearly usually featuring higher page counts color manga pages and higher end premiums 24 25 26 To celebrate the fifth anniversary of the magazine Viz also introduced hardback Collector Editions of some of the magazine's most popular series as a part of their main Shonen Jump manga imprint The new editions were larger sized with color dust jackets and higher quality paper than the normal volumes They also included several full color pages not seen in the initial releases Viz also released Shonen Jump Fifth Anniversary Collector's Edition a hardcover book containing chapters from its best selling series along with various articles and interviews that appeared in the magazine during its first five year history a timeline tracking the history of manga and essays written by editors from Shonen Jump and Weekly Sh nen Jump 27 The premiere issue of Shonen Jump contained chapters from five different manga series 11 before it was expanded to include chapters from seven series 28 Fourteen series were featured in the magazine with seven having ended their runs to be replaced with other series Only four of those remained in the magazine until all of their chapters had been published Each title serialized in the magazine is also published in tank bon volumes under the company's related Shonen Jump and Shonen Jump Advanced labels This is a complete list of all titles to be serialized in Shonen Jump It does not include previews of titles The titles that were running in the magazine when it was discontinued are highlighted In conjunction with the Shonen Jump anthology Viz Media has created multiple new imprints in its various divisions Shonen Jump is the primary manga imprint for releasing the tank bon volumes of the series that have appeared in the magazine as well as other similar sh n entitles that were serialized in other Jump magazines in Japan A second manga imprint Shonen Jump Advanced was launched in April 2005 to target older teenage and young adult readers with more mature themes 30 In October 2005 Viz expanded the Shonen Jump imprint into their home video releases Shonen Jump Home Video offers anime series and original video animations adapted from manga series appearing in Shonen Jump 31 In 2006 the SJ Fiction imprint part of the Viz Fiction line was announced The imprint is used for light novel releases related to manga series appearing in Shonen Jump 32 33 SJ Profiles prints fan books data books and other similar works for the Shonen Jump series while art books are released under the Art of SJ imprint 34 35 The initial issue of Shonen Jumps old over 300 000 copies far exceeding Viz's expected 100 000 copies and making it one of the top comic titles in 2002 The first printing of 250 000 copies was sold out before the issue was released and two additional printings were necessary to fully meet the demand 36 After the initial launch the magazine had an average monthly circulation of 190 000 but it quickly grew to 305 000 by its first anniversary The August 2003 issue which included a demo version of an upcoming Yu Gi Oh PC game was the top issue with 540 000 copies sold 37 As of 2008 the magazine had a circulation of 215 000 with subscriptions constituting 54 of the copies distributed 19 Though targeted towards tween teen male consumers according to Viz Media the magazine enjoys a relatively high number of female and adult readers as well comprising 36 and 37 of its readership respectively The Shonen Jump reader has a median age of 16 years and over half of the audience is between the ages of 13 and 17 Official measurements by Simmons notes that among minor age readers the female readership is slightly lower and the median age is 12 19 Shonen Jump was considered the most successful and widely read 31 manga anthology in North America 31 In addition to the unparalleled circulation numbers the Shonen Jump manga imprint has had consistently high sales with many of its titles being top sellers Naruto has been the line's top seller accounting for nearly 10 of all manga sales in North America in 2006 31 38 In December 2002 the magazine received the I Cv 2 Award for Comic Product of the Year due to its unprecedented sales numbers and its successfully connecting comics to both the television medium and theY u Gi Oh collectible card game one of the top CCG games of the year 39 In the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Awards from 2009 Shonen Jump was the winner in the category Best Publication 40 Reviewers of the magazine applauded the selection of series and the various articles included in each issue 11 41 In his coverage of the magazine's debut issue John Jak a la of Anime News Network compared it to the debut issue of competing work Rai j in Comics and was surprised to find himself preferring Shonen Jump despite it being targeted for a younger age group than Rai j in Comics Calling it an impressive debut issue Jak a la predicted that its high quality content and high value for the price would result in the anthology becoming a successful anthology in North America 11 In succeeding reviews Jak a la stated that Shonen Jump put American comics to shame particularly in terms of the size of the magazine for the price versus the normal size of a similarly priced issue of a regular comic book 12 28 He did however note that the episodic nature of some of the series included had started to become repetitive after three issues and that while the articles might appeal to many readers he himself skipped over them 28 In addition to praising the value for the dollar Comic Book Bin's Leroy Dour esse aux felt that each of the chapters included were a self sustaining and satisfying tale with a beginning middle and end that coupled with the character and story summaries included for each series made it easy for readers to keep up with a series even if they missed an issue 41 42 Color me surprised Largely as a show of support for the anthology format I signed up for subscriptions for both RAI J IN COMICS and SHONEN JUMP but I was sure that I would enjoy the former much more than the latter since RC was promoted as being targeted for an older audience and since SJ featured series that I associated with young children's cartoons Instead having read both first issues I find that so far I much prefer SHONEN JUMP both in terms of actual story content as well as in terms of the magazine's production values John Jak a la Anime News Network 11",
