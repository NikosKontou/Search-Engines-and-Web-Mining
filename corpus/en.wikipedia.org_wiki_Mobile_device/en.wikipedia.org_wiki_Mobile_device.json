    "transformers_text": "A mobile device or handheld device is a computer small enough to hold and operate in hand Mobile devices are typically battery powered and possess a flat panel display and one or more built in input devices such as a touchscreen or keypad Modern mobile devices often emphasize wireless networking to both the Internet and to other devices in their vicinity such as headsets or in car entertainment systems via Wi Fi Bluetooth cellular networks or near field communication 1 Device mobility can be viewed in the context of several qualities 2 Strictly speaking many so called mobile devices are not mobile It is the host that is mobile i e a mobile human host carries a non mobile smartphone device An example of a true mobile computing device where the device itself is mobile is a robot Another example is an autonomous vehicle There are three basic ways mobile devices can be physically bound to mobile hosts Accompanied refers to an object being loosely bound and accompanying a mobile host e g a smartphone can be carried in a bag or pocket but can easily be misplaced 2 Hence mobile hosts with embedded devices such as an autonomous vehicle can appear larger than pocket sized The most common size of a mobile computing device is pocket sized but other sizes for mobile devices exist Mark Weiser known as the father of ubiquitous computing 3 referred to device sizes that are tab sized pad and board sized 4 where tabs are defined as accompanied or wearable centimeter sized devices e g smartphones ph able ts and tablets are defined as hand held decimeter sized devices If one changes the form of the mobile devices in terms of being non planar one can also have skin devices and tiny dust sized devices 2 Dust refers to miniaturized devices without direct HC I interfaces e g micro electromechanical systems MEM S ranging from nanometers through micrometers to millimeters See also Smart dust Skin fabrics based upon light emitting and conductive polymers and organic computer devices These can be formed into more flexible non planar display surfaces and products such as clothes and curtains see OLED display Also see smart device Although mobility is often regarded as synonymous with having wireless connectivity these terms are different Not all network access by mobile users applications and devices needs to be via wireless networks and vice versa Wireless access devices can be static and mobile users can move between wired and wireless hotspots such as in Internet caf s 2 Some mobile devices can be used as mobile Internet devices to access the Internet while moving but they do not need to do this and many phone functions or applications are still operational even while disconnected from the Internet What makes the mobile device unique compared to other technologies is the inherent flexibility in the hardware and software Flexible applications include video chat web browsing payment systems near field communication audio recording etc 5 As mobile devices become ubiquitous there will be an increase of services which include the use of the cloud 6 Although a common form of mobile device a smartphone has a display another perhaps even more common form of smart computing device the smart card e g used as a bank card or travel card does not have a display This mobile device often has a CPU and memory but needs to connect or be inserted into a reader to display its internal data or state There are many kinds of mobile devices designed for different applications They include but are not limited to The history of the mobile device has been marked by increasing technological convergence Early mobile devices such as pocket calculators portable media players satellite navigation devices and digital camera excelled at their intended use but were not multifaceted Personal digital assistants PDAs proliferated in the 1990 s as a way to quickly write down notes schedule business appointments and set personal reminders as a handheld supplement to bulkier laptops During the same period the mobile phone evolved from supporting voice communication only to accommodating text messaging Internet connectivity multimedia and video telephony 7 These feature phones eventually gave way to the modern smartphone which combined all the aforementioned devices and more into one device Since the late 2000 s smartphones have been the most common mobile device in the world in terms of quantity sold owing to their great convergence of technologies 8 9 10 By the early 2010 s mobile devices began integrating sensors such as acc el ero meters magneto meters and gyroscopes allowing the detection of orientation and motion 11 Mobile devices may provide biometric user authentication such as face recognition or fingerprint recognition Handheld devices such as enterprise digital assistants have become more rugged for use in mobile field management This involves tasks such as digitizing notes sending and receiving invoices asset management recording signatures managing parts and scanning barcodes and RFID tags In 2009 developments in mobile collaboration systems enabled the use of handheld devices that combine video audio and on screen drawing capabilities to enable multi party conferencing in real time independent of location 12 Handheld computers are available in a variety of form factors including smartphones handheld PDAs Ultra mobile PC and tablet computers Palm OS Web OS 13 Users can watch television through the Internet by IPTV on some mobile devices Mobile television receivers have existed since 1960 14 and in the 21 st century mobile phone providers began making television available on cellular phones 15 In the 2010 s mobile devices were observed to frequently include the ability to sync and share a variety of data despite the distance or specifications of the devices In the medical field mobile devices are quickly becoming essential tools for accessing clinical information such as drugs treatment and even medical calculations 16 Due to the popularity of mobile gaming the gambling industry started offering casino games on mobile devices which led to the inclusion of these devices in the anti hazard legislature as devices that could potentially be used for illegal gambling Additional potentially unlawful actions could encompass the utilization of mobile devices in disseminating explicit material involving minors Moreover the legitimate adult entertainment sector's incorporation of mobile apps and technology to advance its operations raises concerns There is also a prospect of leveraging mobile devices to facilitate cross border services warranting regulatory attention Within the military domain mobile devices have introduced novel prospects for delivering training and educational resources to soldiers irrespective of their stationed location 17",
