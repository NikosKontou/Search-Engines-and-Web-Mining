In the present, Garp appears pleased when Luffy deters the Marines and escapes. They end up at Baratie, a floating restaurant, where Luffy befriends itssous chefSanji. Garp hires Dracule Mihawk, a pirate known as the world's greatest swordsman, to bring Luffy in alive. Helmeppo tells Koby that Mihawk is one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, powerful pirates whom the World Government found it more useful to ally with. When Mihawk arrives at Baratie, Zoro, who has idolized Mihawk since childhood, challenges him to a duel. Zoro viciously loses the duel and is severely wounded, though Mihawk lets him and Luffy go free out of respect for their resolve. A humbled Zoro swears to Luffy that he will never lose again before losing consciousness.",
