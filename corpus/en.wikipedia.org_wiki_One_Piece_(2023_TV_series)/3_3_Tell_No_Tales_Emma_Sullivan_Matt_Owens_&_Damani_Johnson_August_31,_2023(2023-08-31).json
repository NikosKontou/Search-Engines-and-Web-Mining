Luffy likes a ship with a sheep figurehead, but is informed by Usopp, a dockworker who constantly gives false alarms of pirate attacks, that the ship is not for sale. Usopp takes them to meet the shipyard owner and his best friend, Kaya, a rich, sickly orphan, to ask about the ship. Garp takes Koby under his wing, knowing of his friendship with Luffy. Luffy and Usopp bond over Luffy knowing Usopp's father Yasopp, a member of Shanks's crew. Kaya's butler Klahadore reveals himself as the presumed-dead Kuro of the Black Cat Pirates. Planning to take over Kaya's business, he kills her lawyer Merry. Kuro's crewmates knock out Zoro and dumps him and Merry's corpse in a well. Usopp flees for help, but no one believes him until Koby arrives with the Marines.",
