They meet Nojiko, her adoptive older sister, who reveals that as children, Arlong killed their adoptive mother Bell-mère. Garp questions Zeff about Luffy's whereabouts, revealing that he does not want his grandson to end up executed like Roger. Nami reveals to Nojiko that she has been working for Arlong since Bell-mère's death to buy Coco village's freedom by paying him 100 million berry. When Nami informs Arlong that she finally has the money, he betrays her by bribing Marine Captain Nezumi to hide his crimes and confiscate Nami's money. With her efforts having gone in vain, Nami has a breakdown, stabbing her arm to remove Arlong's tattoo. When she is stopped by Luffy, she begs for his help. As the Straw Hats rally together, Arlong attacks Coco Village.",
