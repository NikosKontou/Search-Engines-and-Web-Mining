Sanji tells the Straw Hats that Zeff saved his life by giving a young Sanji all of the food on a deserted island while Zeff ate his own leg. He also reveals his dream to find the All Blue, an area where all four seas meet and contains rare spices and fish. Koby learns of Garp and Luffy's relationship as grandfather and grandson. Fish-man pirate captain Arlong arrives in search of the Grand Line map, having taken Buggy's head hostage to find Luffy. Nami gives Arlong the map and reveals herself as his crewmate. Arlong throws Luffy into the sea, as Devil Fruit users cannot swim, and leaves with Nami; Sanji rescues him. In disbelief, Luffy feels he has failed as a captain until Zoro awakens and swears to stand by him as his first mate, while Sanji joins the Straw Hats as their cook. His confidence renewed, Luffy decides to go after Nami, with Buggy's head in his bag to help them track down Arlong.",
