Twenty-two years later, Monkey D. Luffy is one of those searching for the treasure. As a child, Luffy unwittingly ate the Gum-Gum Fruit, a \"Devil Fruit\" that gives him elasticity powers. He winds up on the ship of pirate captain Alvida. Luffy defeats Alvida and escapes with her cabin boy, Koby, who dreams of becoming a Marine. Luffy and Koby sail to a Marine base in Shells Town to get a map of the Grand Line, a treacherous route believed to house the One Piece. The pirate hunter Roronoa Zoro is arrested for fighting Helmeppo, son of Marine Captain Morgan, but is freed by Luffy. Nami, a thief who also wants the map, helps Luffy steal from Morgan's safe. Zoro helps them defeat Morgan and the trio escape on a ship while Koby remains behind to enlist with the Marines.",
