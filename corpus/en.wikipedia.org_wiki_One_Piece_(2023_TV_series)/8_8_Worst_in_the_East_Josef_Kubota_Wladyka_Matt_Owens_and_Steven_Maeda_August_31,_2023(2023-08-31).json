Realizing that Arlong's tower contains 8 years of Nami's painful memories, an enraged Luffy destroys the tower, crushes Arlong, and frees Coco village. Nezumi calls Garp to arrest the Straw Hats; Koby and Helmeppo refuse to arrest them, knowing they are innocent. Garp easily wins in a fight against Luffy, but the latter stands firm. Garp relents, as he had simply been testing Luffy's desire to be a pirate. Nezumi puts out a wanted poster of Luffy, fulfilling his dream of having one. Shanks and his crew celebrate Luffy's bounty with Mihawk, while Buggy and Alvida meet. Garp, impressed with Koby and Helmeppo's will to stand by what is right, decides to personally train them. As the Straw Hats embark on their journey to the Grand Line, a Marine burns Luffy's bounty poster.",
