businesses putting over 1 000 employees on its payroll at its peak Its reliance on acquisitions and stock swap mergers to achieve growth also made it one of the country's most controversial enterprises Its growth came to a resounding halt when scandal erupted in early 2006 An investigation of securities law violations led to a nosedive in the company's stock price The Tokyo Stock Exchange de listed Live door on April 14 2006 1 The floundering company's properties were purchased by South Korea based NHN Corporation in 2010 2 3 The ISP and blog services that bear the Live door

2004 7 This was followed by a 1 100 stock split In March 2004 during the 2004 Nippon Professional Baseball realignment Live door moved to acquire the Kin tetsu Buffaloes a Japanese baseball team but later withdrew its offer and in September 2004 founded its own team named live door baseball and applied for admittance to Japan's professional baseball organization The team's home ground was to be

2005 Live door acquisitions in the U S included Mail Creations in Miami Florida in June 2004 which functioned as the company's U S headquarters Live door entered search and contextual advertising spaces in America in November 2005 A scandal involving securities law violations led the Tokyo Stock Exchange to de list Live door on April 14 2006 8 9 The case broke on January 16 2006 when Tokyo prosecutors raided several Live door locations Horie's home and the homes of other Live door and subsidiary executives on suspicions of securities fraud The raids spooked investors and sent shares plunging on January 17 and 18 as a widening criminal investigation sparked panic selling on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Some brokers announced they would no longer allow use of the issue for margin trading Volume was so heavy that it threatened to overload the TSE's computer system prompting a halt in trading for the entire market a breaking record and the first time this has ever occurred The TSE ordered Live door to provide a formal response to the allegations When the company filed a hasty report after a quick internal investigation the TSE told executives to provide a more detailed report and threatened to de list Live door if allegations of improper activities proved valid On January 18 2006 Hideaki Noguchi an executive of H S Securities a firm raided by prosecutors earlier in the week in connection with Live door was found dead in a Naha Okinawa hotel room in what the authorities labeled a suicide 10 The authorities called in several Live door and subsidiary executives for questioning over several days and Horie himself on January 23 After several hours of questioning Horie investigators felt they had learned enough to press charges and petitioned for four arrest warrants which were granted Horie Live door's chief financial officer and the presidents of two subsidiaries were arrested mid evening for securities and accounting fraud 11 They were held for two months without bail and during this time Live door's temporary Representative Director Fu mito Kumagai was also arrested 12 Japan's Securities Commission filed a criminal complaint against the five arrested ex executives of the company on March 13 2006 Founder Horie was sentenced to 2 5 years in jail on March 16 2007 Others were given various jail sentences four days later but appealed 13 After losing 90 of its stock price in four months and strong evidence of securities fraud Live door was de listed from the Tokyo Stock Exchange on April 14 2006 14 Fuji Television sued the company for 35 billion in damages in March 2007 15 1 000 individual investors filed a class action suit in May 2006 eventually rising to 3 340 asking for 23 billion which resulted in a final ruling of 7 6 billion against Live door 16 and other similar suits resulted at least one judgment of 4 9 billion 17 Live door in turn sued its own executives with founder Horie settling for 21 billion and six others settling for a total of 760 million 18 Information obtained during the investigation led to the arrest and conviction of fund manager Yoshiaki Murakami for using inside information to profit off of a stake Live door purchased in Nippon Broadcasting System in 2005 19 Horie published an autobiography during his appeals Complete Resistance in which he proclaims his innocence and states that he was being targeted only due to his infamy not the actual nature or severity of any crimes 20 The veracity of the suspicions aside many smelled conspiracy given the timing of the action It was seen as a political move by defenders of the status quo to punish Horie for daring to challenge them and to discredit him and the business practices he had come to represent which Horie's opponents considered distasteful and un Japanese 21 In order to prevent a recurrence of the scandal Japan passed a law similar to Sar banes Oxley nicknamed J SOX on June 14 2006 In 2007 the company spun off to create a new subsidiary that retained the name of Live door and most of its portal related businesses and itself became a pure holding company named Live door Holdings that oversaw the legal and financial management of its subsidiaries reportedly 44 subsidiaries as of the end of 2005 22 including the new Live door In 2008 Live door Holdings changed its name to LD H Corporation 23 During the upheaval in 2006 and 2007 rumors spread that Live door was preparing a 2 billion initial public offering in 2008 Several technology companies expressed interest in participating but the IPO never materialized Live door instead put itself up for sale In early 2010 South Korea based NHN Corporation bought Live door for a reported 6 3 billion 2 After completing the sale of Live door and other subsidiaries and paying dividends to its shareholders LD H Corporation entered into voluntary liquidation by the shareholders ' resolution in August 2011 and completed liquidation in December 2012 after distributing residual assets to its shareholders The headquarters of the original Live door company were located in the Sumitomo Fu do san Nishi shinjuku Building Sumitomo Fu d san Nishi Shinjuku Bir u in Nishi
