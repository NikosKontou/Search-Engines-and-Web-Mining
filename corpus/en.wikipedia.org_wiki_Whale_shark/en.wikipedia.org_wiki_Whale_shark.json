    "transformers_text": "The whale shark Rhincodon ty pus is a slow moving filter feeding carpet shark and the largest known extant fish species The largest confirmed individual had a length of 18 8 m 61 7 ft 8 The whale shark holds many records for size in the animal kingdom most notably being by far the most massive living non cetacean animal It is the only living species of the genus Rhincodon and the only extant member of the family Rhincodon ti dae which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes Before 1984 it was classified as Rhin i odon into Rhino do ntida e An extinct species Rhincodon ferri olen s is was described in Europe probably in Spain in Late Bur dig alian stage The whale shark is an active filter feeder primarily consuming plankton krill fish eggs and small schooling fish such as sardines and anchovies It employs two main feeding methods ram filtration where it swims forward with its mouth open to force water over its gill rakers and active suction feeding where it gulps water while stationary The shark can process over 6 000 liters of water per hour through its specialized sieve like gill pads Highly migratory the whale shark travels thousands of miles across tropical oceans to exploit seasonal food sources with large predictable feeding aggregations occurring at coastal sites such as Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and off the coast of Gujarat and Kerala in India Despite its immense size the whale shark is docile and poses no significant threat to humans It is currently listed as an Endangered species on the IUCN Red List due to a population decline of more than 50 over the last 75 years primarily as a result of targeted fishing bycatch in other fisheries and collisions with large ships 9 Whale sharks inhabit the open waters of all tropical oceans They are rarely found in water below 21 C 70 F 2 The lifespan of a whale shark is estimated to be between 80 and 130 years based on studies of their vertebral growth bands and the growth rates of free swimming sharks 10 11 12 Whale sharks have very large mouths and are filter feeders which is a feeding mode that occurs in only two other sharks the megamouth shark and the basking shark They feed almost exclusively on plankton and small fishes and do not generally pose a threat to humans The species was distinguished in April 1828 after the harpooning of a 4 6 m 15 ft specimen in Table Bay South Africa Andrew Smith a military doctor associated with British troops stationed in Cape Town described it the following year 13 The name whale shark refers to the animal's appearance and large size it is a fish not a mammal and like all sharks is not closely related to whales 14 The whale shark is one of the most ancient shark species still extant today with the earliest fossil teeth known from the Late Oligocene of South Carolina US Their teeth become more geographically widespread from the Early Miocene onwards where they are known from other parts of the eastern United States southern France and Costa Rica 15 Whale sharks possess a broad flattened head with a large mouth and two small eyes located at the front corners 16 17 Unlike many other sharks whale shark mouths are located at the front of the head rather than on the underside of the head 18 A 12 1 m 39 7 ft whale shark was reported to have a mouth 1 55 m 5 1 ft across 19 Whale shark mouths can contain over 300 rows of tiny teeth and 20 filter pads which it uses to filter feed 20 The spiracles are located just behind the eyes Whale sharks have five large pairs of gills Their skin is dark grey with a white belly marked with an arrangement of pale grey or white spots and stripes that is unique to each individual The skin can be up to 15 cm 5 9 in thick and is very hard and rough to the touch The whale shark has three prominent ridges along its sides which start above and behind the head and end at the caudal ped uncle 17 The shark has two dorsal fins set relatively far back on the body a pair of pectoral fins a pair of pelvic fins and a single medial anal fin The caudal fin has a larger upper lobe than the lower lobe he te roc er cal Whale sharks have been found to possess dermal denticles on the surface of their eyeballs that are structured differently from their body denticles The dermal denticles as well as the whale shark's ability to retract its eyes deep into their sockets serve to protect the eyes from damage 21 22 Evidence suggests that whale sharks can recover from major injuries and may be able to regenerate small sections of their fins Their spot markings have also been shown to reform over a previously wounded area 23 The complete and annotated genome of the whale shark was published in 2017 24 Rhodopsin the light sensing pigment in the rod cells of the retina is normally sensitive to green and used to see in dim light but in the whale shark and the bottom dwelling cloudy cat shark two amino acid substitutions make the pigment more sensitive to blue light instead the light that dominates the deep ocean One of these mutations also makes rhodopsin vulnerable to higher temperatures In humans a similar mutation leads to congenital stationary night blindness as the human body temperature makes the pigment decay 25 26 This pigment becomes unstable in shallow water where the temperature is higher and the full spectrum of light is present To protect from this instability the whale shark deactivates the pigment when in shallow water as otherwise the pigment would hinder full color vision In the colder environment at 2 000 meters below the surface where the shark dives it is activated again 27 The mutations thus allow the shark to see well at both ends of its great vertical range 28 29 The eyes have also lost all cone opsins except LW S 30 The whale shark is the largest non cetacean animal in the world However the maximum size and growth patterns of the species are not well understood 8 31 Limited evidence mostly from males suggests that sexual maturity occurs around 8 to 9 meters 26 to 30 ft in length with the possibility of females sexually maturing at a similar size or larger 16 32 33 34 Various studies have aimed to estimate the growth and longevity of whale sharks either by analyzing evidence from vertebral growth rings or measurements taken from re sighted sharks over several years This information is used to model growth curves which can predict asymptotic length The growth curves produced from these studies have estimated asymptotic lengths ranging from 15 to 21 9 meters 49 to 72 ft 12 35 36 31 10 A 2020 study looked at the growth of whale shark individuals over a 10 year period around the Ningaloo Reef and concluded the species exhibits sexual dimorphism with regard to size with females growing larger than males The study found that males on average reach 8 to 9 meters 26 to 30 ft in length The same study had less female data but estimated an average length of around 14 5 m 48 ft However this value dropped to 12 1 m 40 ft if data from aquarium whale sharks was included The authors noted that these estimates represent average asymptotic size and are not the maximum sizes possible Additionally they acknowledged the potential for regional size variation 31 Most previous growth studies have had data predominately from males and none have data from sharks over 10 m 33 ft Not all previous studies created separate growth curves for males and females instead combining data from both sexes Those studies that made sex specific growth curves have estimated large asymptotic length estimates for males with lengths of 18 m 59 ft or more However mostly immature males were available in these studies with few adults to constrain the upper portion of the growth curves 31 The largest total length for the species is uncertain due to a lack of detailed documentation of the largest reported individuals Whale sharks as large as 18 to 20 meters 59 to 66 ft in length have been reported in scientific literature However most whale sharks observed are smaller 8 Large whale sharks are difficult to measure accurately both on the land and in the water When on land the total length measurement can be affected by how the tail is positioned either angled as it would be in life or stretched as far as possible Historically techniques such as comparisons to objects of known size and knotted ropes have been used for in water measurements but these techniques may be inaccurate 33 Various forms of photo gram me try have been used to improve the accuracy of in water measurements including underwater and aerial techniques 33 37 38 Since the 1800 s there have been accounts of very large whale sharks Some of these are as follows In 1868 the Irish natural scientist Edward Perceval Wright obtained several small whale shark specimens in the Seychelles Wright was informed of one whale shark that was measured as exceeding 45 ft 14 m Wright claimed to have observed specimens over 50 ft 15 m and was told of specimens upwards of 70 ft 21 m 39 Hugh M Smith described a huge animal caught in a bamboo fish trap in Thailand in 1919 The shark was too heavy to pull ashore and no measurements were taken Smith learned through independent sources that it was at least 10 wa a Thai unit of length measuring between a person's outstretched arms Smith noted that one wa could be interpreted as either 2 m 6 6 ft or the approximate average of 1 7 to 1 8 m 5 6 5 9 ft based on the local fishermen 40 Later sources have stated this whale shark as approximately 18 m 59 ft but the accuracy of the estimate has been questioned 16 8 In 1934 a ship named the Maung a nui came across a whale shark in the southern Pacific Ocean and rammed it The shark became stuck on the prow of the ship supposedly with 15 ft 4 6 m on one side and 40 ft 12 2 m on the other suggesting a total length of about 55 ft 17 m 41 42 Scott A Eckert Brent S Stewart reported on satellite tracking of whale sharks from 1994 to 1996 Out of the 15 individuals tracked two females were reported as measuring 15 m 49 ft and 18 m 59 ft 43 A 20 75 m 68 1 ft long whale shark was reported as being stranded along the Ratna giri coast in 1995 44 45 A female individual with a standard length of 15 m 49 2 ft and an estimated total length at 18 8 m 61 7 ft was reported from the Arabian Sea in 2001 46 In a 2015 study reviewing the size of marine megafauna McClain and colleagues considered this female as being the most reliable and accurately measured 8 On 7 February 2012 a large whale shark was found floating 150 kilometres 93 mi off the coast of Karachi Pakistan The length of the specimen was said to be between 11 and 12 m 36 and 39 ft with a weight of around 15 000 kg 33 000 lb 47 The whale shark inhabits all tropical and warm temperate seas The fish is primarily pelagic and can be found in both coastal and oceanic habitats 2 Tracking devices have shown that the whale shark displays dynamic patterns of habitat utilization likely in response to availability of prey Whale sharks observed off the northeast Yucatan Peninsula tend to engage in inshore surface swimming between sunrise and mid afternoon followed by regular vertical oscillations in oceanic waters during the afternoon and overnight About 95 of the oscillating period was spent in epi pelagic depths 200 metres 660 ft but whale sharks also took regular deep dives 500 metres 1 600 ft often descending in brief stutter steps perhaps for foraging The deepest recorded dive was 1 928 metres 6 325 ft Whale sharks were also observed to remain continuously at depths of greater than 50 metres 160 ft for three days or more 48 49 50 The whale shark is migratory 11 and has two distinct sub populations an Atlantic sub population from Maine and the Azores to Cape Agulhas South Africa and an Indo Pacific sub population which holds 75 of the entire whale shark population It usually roams between 30 N and 35 S where water temperatures are higher than 21 C 70 F but have been spotted as far north as the Bay of Fund y Canada and theSe a of Ok hot sk north of Japan and as far south as Victoria Australia 2 Seasonal feeding aggregations occur at several coastal sites such as the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia Darwin Island in the Gal pagos Quintana Roo in Mexico Mafia Island of Pw ani Region in Tanzania In ham bane province in Mozambique the Philippines around Ma he in the Seychelles 2 the Gujarat and Kerala coasts of India 51 52 Taiwan southern China 2 and Qatar 53 In 2009 more than 400 whale sharks gathered off the Yucatan Coast It was one of the largest gatherings of whale sharks recorded 54 Aggregations in that area are among the most reliable seasonal gatherings known for whale sharks with large numbers occurring in most years between May and September Associated ecotourism has grown rapidly to unsustainable levels 55 Growth longevity and reproduction of the whale shark are poorly understood 12 32 36 Vertebral growth bands have been used to estimate the age growth and longevity of whale sharks However there was uncertainty as to whether vertebrae growth bands are formed annually or biannually 35 10 12 A 2020 study compared the ratio of Carbon 14 isotopes found in growth bands of whale shark vertebrae to nuclear testing events in the 1950 60 s finding that growth bands are laid down annually The study found an age of 50 years for a 10 m 33 ft female and 35 years for a 9 9 m 32 ft male 36 Various studies looking at vertebrae growth bands and measuring whale sharks in the wild have estimated their lifespans from 80 years and up to 130 years 10 11 12 Evidence suggests that males grow faster than females in the earlier stages of life but ultimately reach a smaller maximum size 31 Whale sharks exhibit late sexual maturity 36 One study looking at free swimming whale sharks estimated the age at maturity in males at 25 years 12 Pupping of whale sharks has not been observed but mating has been witnessed twice in St Helena 56 Mating in this species was filmed for the first time in whale sharks off Ningaloo Reef via airplane in Australia in 2019 when a larger male unsuccessfully attempted to mate with a smaller immature female 57 The capture of a 10 6 m 35 ft female in July 1996 that was pregnant with 300 pups indicated that whale sharks are ovoviviparous 11 58 59 The eggs remain in the body and the females give birth to live young which are 40 to 60 cm 16 to 24 in long Evidence indicates the pups are not all born at once but rather the female retains sperm from one mating and produces a steady stream of pups over a prolonged period 60 On 7 March 2009 marine scientists in the Philippines discovered what is believed to be the smallest living specimen of the whale shark The young shark measuring only 38 cm 15 in was found with its tail tied to a stake at a beach in Pilar Sorsogon Philippines and was released into the wild Based on this discovery some scientists no longer believe this area is just a feeding ground this site may be a birthing ground as well Both young whale sharks and pregnant females have been seen in the waters of St Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean where numerous whale sharks can be spotted during the summer 61 62 In a report from R apple r last August 2019 whale sharks were sighted during WWF Philippines ' photo identification activities in the first half of the year There were a total 168 sightings 64 of them re sightings or reappearances of previously recorded whale sharks WWF noted that very young whale shark juveniles were identified among the 168 individuals spotted in the first half of 2019 Their presence suggests that the Ticao Pass may be a pupping ground for whale sharks further increasing the ecological significance of the area 63 Large adult females often pregnant are a seasonal presence around the Galapagos Islands which may have reproductive significance 64 65 One study between 2011 and 2013 found that 91 5 of the whale sharks observed around Darwin Island were adult females 65 The whale shark is a filter feeder one of only three known filter feeding shark species along with the basking shark and the megamouth shark It feeds on plankton including copepods krill chaetognaths jellyfish fish eggs Christmas Island red crab larvae and small nek tonic life such as small squid or fish sardines anchovies mackerels and small tunas 66 67 It also feeds on clouds of eggs during mass spawning of fish and corals 68 In addition they have been found to ingest and partially digest Sargassum thus making them omnivores 69 The many rows of vestigial teeth play no role in feeding Feeding occurs either by ram filtration in which the animal opens its mouth and swims forward pushing water and food into the mouth or by active suction feeding in which the animal opens and closes its mouth sucking in volumes of water that are then expelled through the gills In both cases the filter pads serve to separate food from water These unique black sieve like structures are presumed to be modified gill rakers Food separation in whale sharks is by cross flow filtration in which the water travels nearly parallel to the filter pad surface not perpendicular ly through it before passing to the outside while denser food particles continue to the back of the throat 70 This is an extremely efficient filtration method that minimizes fouling of the filter pad surface Whale sharks have been observed coughing presumably to clear a build up of particles from the filter pads Whale sharks migrate to feed and possibly to breed 11 71 72 The whale shark is an active feeder targeting concentrations of plankton or fish It is able to ram filter feed or can gulp in a stationary position This is in contrast to the passive feeding basking shark which does not pump water Instead it swims to force water across its gills 11 71 A juvenile whale shark is estimated to eat 21 kg 46 pounds of plankton per day 73 The BBC program Planet Earth filmed a whale shark feeding on a school of small fish The same documentary showed footage of a whale shark timing its arrival to coincide with the mass spawning of fish shoals and feeding on the resultant clouds of eggs and sperm 68 Due to their mode of feeding whale sharks are susceptible to the ingestion of micro plastics As such the presence of micro plastics in whale shark scat was recently confirmed 74 Despite their great size whale sharks pose no danger to humans Younger whale sharks are gentle and can play with divers Underwater photographers such as Fiona Ayers t have photographed them swimming close to humans without any danger 75 Although whale sharks are docile fish touching or riding the sharks is strictly forbidden and fine able in most countries 76 77 78 as it can cause serious harm to the animal 79 80 81 The shark is seen by divers in many places including the Bay Islands in Honduras Thailand Indonesia Bone Bolan go Ce ndra was ih Bay the Philippines the Maldives close toM aami gili South Ari Atoll the Red Sea Western

and other parts of the Caribbean 82 Juveniles can be found near the shore in the Gulf of Tad jour a near Djibouti in the Horn of Africa 83 Estimating the exact number of whale sharks globally is challenging due to their migratory nature and the vastness of their habitat Current estimates suggest that approximately 130 000 to 200 000 whale sharks inhabit the world's oceans However these numbers are declining Over the past 75 years the global whale shark population has decreased by about 50 with declines of approximately 63 in the Indian and Pacific Oceans and over 30 in the Atlantic Ocean This decline is attributed to threats such as fishing bycatch vessel strikes and pollution Consequently the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN has listed the whale shark as an endangered species 2 84 In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the whale shark as Migrant with the qualifier Secure Overseas under the New Zealand Threat Classification System 85 It is listed along with six other species of sharks under the CMS Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks 86 In 1998 the Philippines banned all fishing selling importing and exporting of whale sharks for commercial purposes 87 followed by India in May 2001 88 and Taiwan in May 2007 89 In 2010 the Gulf of Mexico oil spill resulted in 4 900 000 barrels 780 000 m 3 of oil flowing into an area south of the Mississippi River Delta where one third of all whale shark sightings in the northern part of the gulf have occurred in recent years Sightings confirmed that the whale sharks were unable to avoid the oil slick which was situated on the surface of the sea where the whale sharks feed for several hours at a time No dead whale sharks were found 90 This species was also added to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES in 2003 to regulate the international trade of live specimens and its parts 91 It was reported in 2014 that hundreds of whale sharks were illegally killed every year in China for their fins skins and oil 92 The whale shark is popular in the few public aquariums that keep it but its large size means that a very large tank is required and it has specialized feeding requirements 93 Their large size and iconic status have also fueled an opposition to keeping the species in captivity especially after the early death of some whale sharks in captivity and certain Chinese aquariums keeping the species in relatively small tanks 94 95 The first attempt at keeping whale sharks in captivity was in 1934 when an individual was kept for about four months in a netted off natural bay in I zu Japan 96 The first attempt of keeping whale sharks in an aquarium was initiated in 1980 by the Okinawa Chur a umi Aquarium then known as Okinawa Ocean Expo Aquarium in Japan 93 Since 1980 several have been kept at Okinawa mostly obtained from incidental catches in coastal nets set by fishers none after 2009 but two were stranding s Several of these were already weak from the capture stranding and some were released 93 but initial captive survival rates were low 95 After the initial difficulties in maintaining the species had been resolved some have survived long term in captivity 93 The record for a whale shark in captivity is an individual that as of 2021 has lived for more than 26 years in the Okinawa Chur a umi Aquarium from Okinawa Ocean Expo Aquarium 97 93 Following Okinawa Osaka Aquarium started keeping whale sharks and most of the basic research on the keeping of the species was made at these two institutions 98 Since the mid 1990 s several other aquariums have kept the species in Japan Kagoshima Aquarium Kino saki Marine World No to jima Aquarium Oita Marine Palace Aquarium and Yokohama Hak keiji ma Sea Paradise South Korea Aqua Planet Jeju China Chime long Ocean Kingdom Dalian Aquarium Guangzhou Aquarium in Guangzhou Zoo Qing dao Polar Ocean World and Yantai Aquarium Taiwan National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium India Thiruvananthapuram Aquarium and Dubai Atlantis The Palm with some maintaining whale sharks for years and others only for a very short period 96 The whale shark kept at Dubai's Atlantis The Palm was rescued from shallow waters in 2008 with extensive abrasions to the fins and after rehabilitation it was released in 2010 having lived 19 months in captivity 99 100 Marine Life Park in Singapore had planned on keeping whale sharks but scrapped this idea in 2009 101 102 Outside Asia the first and so far only place to keep whale sharks is Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta United States 96 This is unusual because of the comparatively long transport time and complex logistics required to bring the sharks to the aquarium ranging between 28 and 36 hours 98 As of August 2025 Georgia keeps one whale shark a male named Yu shan who arrived in 2007 103 Two earlier males at Georgia Aquarium Ralph and Norton both died in 2007 95 Trixie died in 2020 Alice died in 2021 Taro ko died in 2025 Georgia's whale sharks were all imported from Taiwan and were taken from the commercial fishing quota for the species usually used locally for food 98 104 Taiwan closed this fishery entirely in 2008 104 In Madagascar whale sharks are called mar ok in tana in Malagasy meaning many stars after the appearance of the markings on the shark's back 105 In the Philippines it is called but and ing and bali lan 106 The whale shark is featured on the reverse of the Philippine 100 peso bill By law snorkelers must maintain a distance of 4 ft 1 2 m from the sharks and there is a fine and possible prison sentence for anyone who touches the animals 107 Whale sharks are also known as j in bei za mein Japan because the markings resemble patterns typically seen on j in bei gura no bin tang roughly star from the East 108 in Indonesia and ca ong literally sir fish in Vietnam 109 The whale shark is also featured on the
