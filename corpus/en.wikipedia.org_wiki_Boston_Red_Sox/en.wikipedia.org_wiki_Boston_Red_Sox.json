    "transformers_text": "The Boston Red Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Boston The Red Sox compete in Major League Baseball MLB as a member club of the American League AL East Division Founded in 1901 as one of the American League's eight charter franchises the team's home ballpark has been Fenway Park since 1912 The Red Sox name was chosen by the team owner John I Taylor c 1908 following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the Boston Red Stockings including the Boston Braves now the Atlanta Braves 5 The team has won nine World Series championships tied for the third most of any MLB team and has played in thirteen World Series Their most recent World Series appearance and win was in 2018 In addition they won the 1904 American League pennant but were not able to defend their 1903 World Series championship when the New York Giants refused to participate in the 1904 World Series The Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918 However they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history dubbed the Curse of the Bambino after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox ' sale of star player Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after their World Series championship in 1918 The Sox endured an 86 year wait before the team's sixth World Series championship in 2004 The team's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history including Enos Slaughter's mad dash in 1946 the Impossible Dream of 1967 Carlton Fisk's home run in 1975 and Bill Buck ner's error in 1986 Following their victory in the 2018 World Series they became the first team to win four World Series trophies in the 21 st century with championships in 2004 2007 2013 and 2018 The team's history has also been marked by its intense rivalry with the New York Yankees arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American professional sports 6 7 8 The Red Sox are owned by Fenway Sports Group which also owns Liverpool of the Premier League in England the National Hockey League's Pittsburgh Penguins and partially own sR FK Racing of the NASCAR Cup Series They are consistently one of the top MLB teams in average road attendance while the small capacity of Fenway Park prevents them from leading in overall attendance 9 From May 15 2003 to April 10 2013 the Red Sox sold out every home game a total of 820 games 794 regular season for a major professional sports record 10 11 Both Neil Diamond's Sweet Caroline and the Stand ells ' Dirty Water have become anthems for the Red Sox 12 13 As of the end of the 2025 season the franchise's all time regular season record is 10 044 9 336 83 518 14 The name Red Sox chosen by owner John I Taylor after the 1907 season refers to the red hose in the team uniform beginning in 1908 Sox had been previously adopted for the Chicago White Sox by newspapers needing a headline friendly form of Stockings as Stockings Win in large type did not fit in a column The team name Red Sox had previously been used as early as 1888 by a colored team from Norfolk Virginia 15 The Spanish language media sometimes refers to the team as Medias Rojas a translation of red socks The official Spanish site uses the variant Los Red Sox 16 The Red Stockings nickname was previously used by the Cincinnati Red Stockings who were members of the pioneering National Association of Base Ball Players Managed by Harry Wright Cincinnati adopted a uniform with white knickers and red stockings and earned the famous nickname a year or two before hiring the first fully professional team in 1869 When the club folded after the 1870 season Wright was hired by Boston businessman Ivers Whitney Adams 17 to organize a new team in Boston and he brought three teammates and the Red Stockings nickname along Most nicknames were then unofficial neither club names nor registered trademarks so the migration was informal The Boston Red Stockings won four championships in the five seasons of the new National Association the first professional league When a new Cincinnati club was formed as a charter member of the National League in 1876 the Red Stockings nickname was commonly reserved for them once again and the Boston team was referred to as the Red Caps Other names were sometimes used before Boston officially adopted the nickname Braves in 1912 the club eventually left Boston for Milwaukee and is now playing in Atlanta In 1901 the upstart American League established a competing club in Boston Originally a team was supposed to be started in Buffalo but league ownership at the last minute removed that city from their plans in favor of the expansion Boston franchise For seven seasons the AL team wore dark blue stockings and had no official nickname They were simply Boston Bostonians or the Bostons or the Americans or Boston Americans as in American League rs Boston being a two team city Their 1901 1907 jerseys both home and road just read Boston except for 1902 when they sported large letters B and A denoting Boston and American Newspaper writers of the time used other nicknames for the club including Somerset s for owner Charles Somers Plymouth Rocks Bean eaters the Collin sites for manager Jimmy Collins and Pilgrims For years many sources have listed Pilgrims as the early Boston AL team's official nickname but researcher Bill Now lin has demonstrated that the name was barely used if at all during the team's early years 18 The origin of the nickname appears to be a poem entitled The Pilgrims At Home written by Edwin Fitzwilliam that was sung at the 1907 home opener Rory O ' More melody 19 This nickname was commonly used during that season perhaps because the team had a new manager and several rookie players John I Taylor had said in December 1907 that the Pilgrims sounded too much like homeless wanderers The National League club in Boston though seldom called the Red Stockings anymore still wore red trim In 1907 the National League club adopted an all white uniform and the American League team saw an opportunity On December 18 1907 Taylor announced that the club had officially adopted red as its new team color The 1908 uniforms featured a large icon of a red stocking angling across the shirt front For 1908 the National League club returned to wearing red trim but the American League team finally had an official nickname and remained the Red Sox for good The name is often shortened to Boso x or BoSo x a combination of Boston and Sox similar to the Chi Sox in Chicago or the minor league Woo Sox of Worcester a minor league affiliate of Boston Sportswriter s sometimes refer to the Red Sox as the Crimson Hose 20 and the Olde Towne Team Recently media have begun to call them the Saw x casually reflecting how the word is pronounced with a New England accent However most fans simply refer to the team as the Sox when the context is understood to mean Red Sox 21 The formal name of the entity which owns the team is Boston Red Sox Baseball Club Limited Partnership 22 The name shown on a door near the main entrance to Fenway Park Boston American League Baseball Company 23 was used prior to the team's reorganization as a limited partnership on May 26 1978 In 1901 the minor Western League led by Ban Johnson declared itself to be equal to the National League then the only major league in baseball 24 Johnson had changed the name of the league to the American League prior to the 1900 season 25 In 1901 the league created a franchise in Boston called the Boston Americans to compete with the National League team there 26 27 Playing their home games at Huntington Avenue Grounds 28 the Boston franchise finished second in the league in 1901 and third in 1902 29 30 The team was originally owned by C W Somers 31 In January 1902 he sold all but one share of the team to Henry Kill ilea 31 The early teams were led by manager and star third baseman Jimmy Collins outfielders Chick Stahl Buck Freeman and Patsy Dougherty and pitcher Cy Young who in 1901 won the pitching Triple Crown with 33 wins 41 8 of the team's 79 wins 1 62 ERA and 158 strikeouts 32 33 34 35 In 1903 the team won their first American League pennant 32 and as a result Boston participated in the first modern World Series going up against the Pittsburgh Pirates 36 Aided by the modified chants of Tess ie by the Royal Rooter s fan club and by its stronger pitching staff the Americans won the best of nine series five games to three 36 37 In April 1904 the team was purchased by John I Taylor of Boston 38 39 The 1904 team found itself in a pennant race against the New York Highlanders 40 A predecessor to what became a storied rivalry this race featured the trade of Patsy Dougherty to the Highlanders for Bob Un glau b 41 In order to win the pennant the Highlanders needed to win both games of their final doubleheader with the Americans at the Highlanders ' home stadium Hilltop Park 42 With Jack Che s bro on the mound and the score tied 2 2 with a man on third in the top of the ninth a spitball got away from Che s bro and Lou Cr iger scored the go ahead run and the Americans won their second pennant 43 However the NL champion New York Giants declined to play any postseason series but a sharp public reaction led the two leagues to make the World Series a permanent championship starting in 1905 44 45 46 In 1906 Boston lost 105 games and finished last in the league 47 In December 1907 Taylor proposed that the Boston Americans name change to the Boston Red Sox 48 By 1909 center fielder Tr is Speaker had become a fixture in the Boston outfield 49 and the team finished the season in third place 50 In 1912 the Red Sox won 105 games and the pennant 51 The 105 wins stood as the club record until the 2018 club won 108 52 53 Anchored by an outfield including Tr is Speaker Harry Hooper and Duffy Lewis and pitcher Smoky Joe Wood the Red Sox beat the New York Giants 4 3 1 in the 1912 World Series best known for Snodgrass's Muff 54 From 1913 to 1916 the Red Sox were owned by Joseph Lanni n In 1914 Lanni n signed a young up and coming pitcher named Babe Ruth from the Baltimore Orioles of the International League 55 56 57 In 1915 the team won 101 games and went on to the 1915 World Series 58 where they beat the Philadelphia Phillies four games to one 59 Following the 1915 season Tr is Speaker was traded to the Cleveland Indians 60 The Red Sox went on to win the 1916 World Series defeating the Brooklyn Robins 61 Harry Fra zee bought the Red Sox from Joseph Lanni n in 1916 for about 675 000 62 63 In 1918 Babe Ruth led the team to another World Series championship over the Chicago Cubs 64 Prior to the sale of Babe Ruth multiple trades occurred between the Red Sox and the Yankees On December 18 1918 outfielder Duffy Lewis pitcher Dutch Leonard and pitcher Ernie Shore were traded to the Yankees for pitcher Ray Caldwell Slim Love Roxy Walters Frank Gil hooley and 15 000 65 66 In July 1919 pitcher Carl May s quit the team and then was traded to the Yankees for Bob McGraw Allan Russell and 40 000 67 After May s was traded league president Ban Johnson suspended him due to his breaking of his contract with the Red Sox 68 69 The Yankees went to court after Johnson suspended May s 68 70 After the Yankees were able to play May s 71 the American League split into two factions the Yankees Red Sox and White Sox known as the In sur rec to s versus Johnson and the remaining five clubs a k a the Loyal Five 68 72 On December 26 1919 the team sold Babe Ruth who had played the previous six seasons for the Red Sox to the rival New York Yankees 73 The sale was announced on January 6 1920 74 In 1919 Ruth had broken the single season home run record hitting 29 home runs 75 76 It was believed that Fra zee sold Ruth to finance the Broadway musical No No Nanette 77 While No No Nanette did not open on Broadway until 1925 Leigh Mont ville's book The Big Bam The Life and Times of Babe Ruth 77 reports that No No Nanette had originated as a non musical stage play called My Lady Friends which opened on Broadway in December 1919 77 According to the book My Lady Friends had been financed by Ruth's sale to the Yankees 77 The sale of Babe Ruth came to be viewed as the beginning of the Yankees Red Sox rivalry considered the best rivalry by American sports journalists 78 In the December 1920 Wally S chang Waite Hoyt Harry Harper and Mike McNally were traded to the Yankees for Del Pratt Muddy Ruel Hank Thor m ahlen Sammy Vick 79 The following winter shortstop Everett Scott and pitchers Bullet Joe Bush and Sad Sam Jones were traded to the Yankees for Roger Peck in pau gh who was immediately traded to the Washington Senators 80 Jack Quinn Rip Collins Bill Pier cy 81 On July 23 1922 Joe Dugan and Elmer Smith were traded to the Yankees for Elmer Miller Chick Few ster Johnny Mitchell and Lefty O ' Do ul 82 83 84 Acquiring Dugan helped the Yankees edge the St Louis Browns in a tight pennant race 85 After late trades in 1922 a June 15 trading deadline went into effect 86 In 1923 Herb Pen nock was traded by the Red Sox to the Yankees for Camp Skinner Norm McMillan and George Murray 87 The loss of several top players sent the Red Sox into free fall 88 During the 1920 s and early 1930 s the Red Sox were fixtures in the second division never finishing closer than 20 games out of first 89 90 The losses increased after Fra zee sold the team to Bob Quinn in 1923 88 90 The team bottomed out in 1932 with a record of 43 111 still the worst record in franchise history 91 However in 1931 Earl Webb set the all time mark for most doubles in a season with 67 92 In 1933 Tom Yaw key bought the team 93 Yaw key acquired pitchers Wes Ferrell 94 and Lefty Grove 95 Joe Cr on in a shortstop and manager 93 and first baseman Jimmie Foxx 96 In 1938 Foxx hit 50 home runs which stood as a club record for 68 years 97 98 That year Foxx also set a club record of 175 runs 99 In 1939 the Red Sox purchased the contract of outfielder Ted Williams from the minor leagueS an Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League ushering in an era of the team sometimes called the Ted Sox Williams consistently hit for both high power and high average and is generally considered one of the greatest hitters of all time The right field bullpens in Fenway were built in part for Williams ' left handed swing and are sometimes called Williamsburg Before this addition it was over 400 feet 120 m to right field He served two stints in the United States Marine Corps as a pilot and saw active duty in both World War II and the Korean War missing at least five full seasons of baseball His book The Science of Hitting is widely read by students of baseball He is currently the last player to hit over 400 for a full season batting 406 in 1941 100 Williams feuded with sports writers his whole career calling them The Knights of the Keyboard and his relationship with the fans was often rocky as he was seen spitting towards the stands on more than one occasion With Williams the Red Sox reached the 1946 World Series but lost to the St Louis Cardinals in seven games in part because of the use of the Williams Shift a defensive tactic in which the shortstop moves to the right side of the in field to make it harder for the left handed hitting Williams to hit to that side of the field Some have claimed that he was too proud to hit to the other side of the field not wanting to let the Cardinals take away his game His performance may have also been affected by a pitch he took in the elbow in an exhibition game a few days earlier Either way in his only World Series Williams gathered just five singles in 25 at bats for a 200 average The Cardinals won the 1946 Series when Enos Slaughter scored the go ahead run all the way from first base on a base hit to left field The throw from Leon Cul berson was cut off by shortstop Johnny Pesky who relayed the ball to the plate just a hair too late Some say Pesky hesitated or held the ball before he turned to throw the ball but this has been disputed Along with Williams and Pesky the Red Sox featured several other star players during the 1940 s including second baseman Bobby Do errand center fielder Dom DiMaggio the younger brother of Joe DiMaggio The Red Sox narrowly lost the AL pennant in 1948 and 1949 In 1948 Boston finished in a tie with Cleveland and their loss to Cleveland in a one game play offended hopes of an all Boston World Series Curiously manager Joseph McCarthy chose journeyman Denny Gale house to start the playoff game when the young lefty phenom Mel Parnell was available to pitch In 1949 the Red Sox were one game ahead of the New York Yankees with the only two games left for both teams being against each other and they lost both of those games The 1950 s were viewed as a time of tribulation for the Red Sox After Williams returned from the Korean War in 1953 many of the best players from the late 1940 s had retired or been traded The stark contrast in the team led critics to call the Red Sox ' daily lineup Ted Williams and the Seven Dwarfs Jackie Robinson was even worked out by the team at Fenway Park however owner Tom Yaw key did not want an African American player on his team Willie May s also tried out for Boston and was highly praised by team scouts In 1955 Frank Mal zone debuted at third base and Ted Williams hit 388 at the age of 38 in 1957 but there was little else for Boston fans to root for Williams retired at the end of the 1960 season famously hitting a home run in his final at bat as memorialized in the John Updike story Hub fans bid Kid adieu The Red Sox finally became the last Major League team to field an African American player when they promoted infielder Pumps ie Green from their AAA farm team in 1959 The 1960 s also started poorly for the Red Sox though 1961 saw the debut of Carl Yaz Yas tr z em ski Williams ' replacement in left field who developed into one of the better hitters of a pitching rich decade Red Sox fans know 1967 as the season of the Impossible Dream The slogan refers to the hit song from the popular musical play Man of La Mancha 1967 saw one of the great pennant races in baseball history with four teams in the AL pennant race until almost the last game The BoSo x had finished the 1966 season in ninth place but they found new life with Yas tr z em ski as the team won the pennant to reach the 1967 World Series Yas tr z em ski won the American League Triple Crown the most recent player to accomplish such a feat until Miguel Cabrera did so in 2012 hitting 326 with 44 home runs and 121 runs batted in He was named the league's Most Valuable Player just one vote shy of a unanimous selection as a Minnesota sportswriter placed Twins center fielder C sar Tovar first on his ballot 101 But the Red Sox lost the series to the St Louis Cardinals in seven games Cardinals pitcher Bob Gibson stymied the Red Sox winning three games An 18 year old Bostonian rookie named Tony Co nig liar o slugged 24 home runs in 1964 Tony C became the youngest player in Major League Baseball to hit his 100 th home run a record that stands today He was struck just above the left cheek bone by a fastball thrown by Jack Hamilton of the California Angels on Friday August 18 1967 and s at out the entire next season with headaches and blurred vision Although he did have a productive season in 1970 he was never the same Although the Red Sox were competitive for much of the late 1960 s and early 1970 s they never finished higher than second place in their division The closest they came to a divisional title was 1972 when they lost by a half game to the Detroit Tigers The start of the season was delayed by a players ' strike and the Red Sox had lost one more game to the strike than the Tigers had Games lost to the strike were not made up The Red Sox went to Detroit with a half game lead for the final series of the season but lost the first two of those three and were eliminated from the pennant race The Red Sox won the AL pennant in 1975 The 1975 Red Sox were as colorful as they were talented with Yas tr z em ski and rookie outfielders Jim Rice and Fred Lynn veteran outfielder Dwight Evans catcher Carlton Fisk and pitchers Luis Tian t and eccentric junk ball er Bill The Spaceman Lee Fred Lynn won both the American League Rookie of the Year award and the Most Valuable Player award a feat which had never previously been accomplished and was not duplicated until Ichiro Suzuki did it in 2001 102 103 In the 1975 American League Championship Series the Red Sox swept the Oakland A's In the 1975 World Series they faced the heavily favored Cincinnati Reds also known as The Big Red Machine Luis Tian t won games 1 and 4 of the World Series but after five games the Red Sox trailed the series 3 games to 2 Game 6 at Fenway Park is considered among the greatest games in postseason history Down 6 3 in the bottom of the eighth inning Red Sox pinch hitter Bernie Carbo hit a three run homer into the center field bleachers off Reds fireman Raw ly East wick to tie the game In the top of the 11 th inning right fielder Dwight Evans made a spectacular catch of a Joe Morgan line drive and doubled off Ken Griffey at first base to preserve the tie In the bottom of the 12 th inning Carlton Fisk hit a deep fly ball that sliced towards the left field foul pole above the Green Monster As the ball sailed into the night Fisk waved his arms frantically towards fair territory seemingly pleading with the ball not to go foul The ball complied and bedlam ensued at Fenway as Fisk rounded the bases to win the game for the Red Sox 7 6 The Red Sox lost game 7 4 3 even though they had an early 3 0 lead Starting pitcher Bill Lee threw a slow looping curve which he called a L eephus pitch or space ball to Reds first baseman Tony P rez who hit the ball over the Green Monster and across the street The Reds scored the winning run in the 9 th inning Carlton Fisk said famously about the 1975 World Series We won that thing 3 games to 4 In 1978 the Red Sox and the Yankees were involved in a tight pennant race The Yankees were 14 1 2 games behind the Red Sox in July and on September 10 after completing a 4 game sweep of the Red Sox known as The Boston Massacre the Yankees tied for the divisional lead On September 16 the Yankees held a 3 1 2 game lead over the Red Sox but the Sox won 11 of their next 13 games and by the final day of the season the Yankees ' magic number to win the division was one with a win over Cleveland or a Boston loss to the Toronto Blue Jays clinching the division However New York lost 9 2 and Boston won 5 0 forcing a one game playoff to be held at Fenway Park on Monday October 2 The most remembered moment from the game was Bucky Dent's 7 th inning three run home run in off Mike To rrez just over the Green Monster giving the Yankees their first lead 104 The dejected Boston manager Don Zimmer gave Mr Dent a new middle name which lives on in Boston sports lore to this day uttering three words as the ball sailed over the left field wall Bucky Fucking Dent Reggie Jackson provided a solo home run in the 8 th that proved to be the difference in the Yankees ' 5 4 win which ended with Yas tr z em ski popping out to Gr aig Nettles in foul territory with Rick Burleson representing the tying run at third Although Dent became a Red Sox demon the Red Sox got retribution in 1990 when the Yankees fired Dent as their manager during a series at Fenway Park 105 Carl Yas tr z em ski retired after the 1983 season during which the Red Sox finished sixth in the seven team AL East posting their worst record since 1966 However in 1986 it appeared that the team's fortunes were about to change The offense had remained strong with Jim Rice Dwight Evans Don Baylor and Wade Boggs Roger Clemens led the pitching staff going 24 4 with a 2 48 ERA and had a 20 strikeout game 106 to win both the American League Cy Young and Most Valuable Player awards Clemens became the first starting pitcher to win both awards since Vida Blue in 1971 103 Despite spending a month and a half on the disabled list in the middle of the season left hand er Bruce Hurst went 13 8 striking out 167 and pitching four shutout games Boston sportswriter s that season compared Clemens and Hurst to Don Drysdale and Sandy Kou fax from the 1960 s Los Angeles Dodgers The Red Sox won the AL East for the first time in 11 seasons and faced the California Angels in the ALCS The teams split the first two games in Boston but the Angels won the next two home games taking a 3 1 lead in the series With the Angels poised to win the series the Red Sox trailed 5 2 heading into the ninth inning of Game 5 A two run homer by Baylor cut the lead to one With two out s and a runner on and one strike away from elimination Dave Henderson homered off Donnie Moore to put Boston up 6 5 Although the Angels tied the game in the bottom of the ninth the Red Sox won in the eleventh on a Henderson sacrifice fly off Moore The Red Sox then found themselves with six and seven run wins at Fenway Park in Games 6 and 7 to win the American League title The Red Sox faced a heavily favored New York Mets team that had won 108 games in the regular season in the 1986 World Series Boston won the first two games in She a Stadium but lost the next two at Fenway knotting the series at two games a piece After Bruce Hurst recorded his second victory of the series in Game 5 the Red Sox returned to She a Stadium looking to garner their first championship in 68 years However Game 6 became one of the most devastating losses in club history After pitching seven strong innings Clemens was lifted from the game with a 3 2 lead Years later Manager John McNamara said Clemens was suffering from a blister and asked to be taken out of the game a claim Clemens denied 107 The Mets then scored a run off relieve rand former Met Calvin S chiral di to tie the score 3 3 The game went to extra innings where the Red Sox took a 5 3 lead in the top of the 10 th on a solo home run by Henderson a double by Boggs and an RBI single by second baseman Marty Barrett After recording two out s in the bottom of the 10 th a graphic appeared on the NBC telecast hailing Barrett as the Player of the Game and Bruce Hurst as Most Valuable Player of the World Series A message even appeared briefly on the She a Stadium scoreboard congratulating the Red Sox as World Series champions After so many years of abject frustration Red Sox fans around the world could taste victory With the count at two balls and one strike Mets catcher Gary Carter hit a single It was followed by singles by Kevin Mitchell and Ray Knight With Mook ie Wilson batting a wild pitch by Bob Stanley tied the game at 5 Wilson then hit a slow ground ball to first the ball rolled through Bill Buck ner's legs allowing Knight to score the winning run from second While Buck ner was singled out as responsible for the loss many observers as well as both Wilson and Buck ner have noted that even if Buck ner had fielded the ball cleanly the speedy Wilson probably would have still been safe leaving the game winning run at third with two out Many observers questioned why Buck ner was in the game at that point considering he had bad knees and that Dave Stapleton had come in as a late inning defensive replacement in prior series games It appeared as though McNamara was trying to reward Buck ner for his long and illustrious career by leaving him in the game After falling behind 3 0 the Mets then won Game 7 concluding the devastating collapse and feeding the myth that the Red Sox were cursed 108 This World Series loss had a strange twist Red Sox General Manager Lou Gorman was vice president player personnel of the Mets from 1980 to 1983 109 Working under Mets ' GM Frank Cash en with whom Gorman served with the Orioles he helped lay the foundation for the Mets ' championship 109 The Red Sox returned to the postseason in 1988 With the club in fourth place midway through the 1988 season at the All Star break manager John McNamara was fired and replaced by Walpole resident and longtime minor league manager Joe Morgan on July 15 The club immediately won 12 games in a row and 19 of 20 overall to surge to the AL East title in what was called Morgan Magic But the magic was short lived as the team was swept by the Oakland Athletics in the ALCS The Most Valuable Player of that Series was former Red Sox pitcher and Baseball Hall of Fame player Dennis Eckersley who saved all four wins for Oakland Two years later in 1990 the Red Sox again won the division and face the Athletics in the ALCS However the outcome was the same with the A's sweeping the ALCS in four straight In 1990 Yankees fans started to chant 1918 to taunt the Red Sox 110 The demeaning chant echoed at Yankee Stadium each time the Red Sox were there 111 Also Fenway Park became the scene of Bucky Dent's worst moment as a manager although it was where he had his greatest triumph 105 In June when the Red Sox swept the Yankees during a four game series at Fenway Park the Yankees fired Dent as their manager Red Sox fans felt retribution to Dent being fired on their field but the Yankees used him as a scapegoat 105 However Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe severely criticized Yankees owner George Stein brenner for firing Dent his 18 th managerial change in as many years since becoming owner in Boston and said he should have waited until the Yankees got to Baltimore to fire Dent 112 He said that if Dent had been fired in Seattle or Milwaukee this would have been just another event in an endless line of George's jettisons But it happened in Boston and the nightly news had its hook 112 The firing was only special because it's the first time a Yankee manager who was also a Red Sox demon was purged on the ancient Indian burial grounds of the Back Bay 112 However Bill Pennington called the firing of Dent merciless 113 Tom Yaw key died in 1976 and his wife Jean R Yaw key took control of the team until her death in 1992 Their initials are shown in two stripes on the left field wall in Morse code 114 Upon Jean's death control of the team passed to the Yaw key Trust led by John Harrington The trust sold the team in 2002 concluding 70 years of Yaw key ownership In 1994 General Manager Lou Gorman was replaced by Dan Duque tte a Massachusetts native who had worked for the Montreal Expos Duque tte revived the team's farm system which during his tenure produced players such as No mar Garciaparra Carl Pavan o and David Eck stein 115 Duque tte also spent money on free agents notably an 8 year 160 million deal for Manny Ram rez after the 2000 season The Red Sox won the newly realigned American League East in 1995 finishing seven games ahead of the Yankees However they were swept in three games in the A LDS by the Cleveland Indians Their postseason losing streak reached 13 straight games dating back to the 1986 World Series Roger Clemens tied his major league record by fanning 20 Detroit Tigers on September 18 1996 in one of his final appearances in a Red Sox uniform After Clemens had turned 30 and then had four seasons 1993 96 which were by his standards mediocre at best Duque tte said the pitcher was entering the twilight of his career 116 Clemens went on to pitch well for another ten years and win four more Cy Young Awards Out of contention in 1997 the team traded closer Heathcliff Slocum b to Seattle for catching prospect Jason Varitek and right handed pitcher Derek Lowe Prior to the start of the 1998 season the Red Sox dealt pitchers Tony Armas Jr and Carl Pavan o to the Montreal Expos for pitcher Pedro Mart nez Mart nez became the anchor of the team's pitching staff and turned in several outstanding seasons In 1998 the team won the American League Wild Card but again lost the American League Division Series to the Indians In 1999 Duque tte called Fenway Park economically obsolete and along with Red Sox ownership led a push for a new stadium On the field the 1999 Red Sox were finally able to overturn their fortunes against the Indians in the American League Division Series Cleveland took a 2 0 series lead but Boston won the next three games behind strong pitching by Derek Lowe Pedro Mart nez and his brother Ram n Mart nez Game 4's 23 7 win by the Red Sox was the highest scoring playoff game in major league history Game 5 began with the Indians taking a 5 2 lead after two innings but Pedro Mart nez nursing a shoulder injury came on in the fourth inning and pitched six innings without allowing a hit while the team's offense rallied for a 12 8 win behind two home runs and seven runs batted in from outfielder Troy O ' Leary After the A LDS victory the Red Sox lost the American League Championship Series to the Yankees four games to one The one bright spot was a lopsided win for the Red Sox in the much hyped Martinez Clemens game In 2002 the Red Sox were sold by Yaw key trustee and president Harrington to New England Sports Ventures a consortium headed by principal owner John Henry Tom Werner served as executive chairman Larry Luc chino served as president and CEO and serving as vice chairman was Les Otten Dan Duque tte was fired as GM of the club on February 28 with former Angels GM Mike Port taking the helm for the 2002 season A week later manager Joe Kerrigan was fired and was replaced by Grady Little While nearly all offseason moves were made under Duque tte such as signing outfielder Johnny Damon away from the Oakland Athletics the new ownership made additions such as outfielder Cliff Floyd and relief pitcher Alan Em bree No mar Garciaparra Manny Ram rez and Floyd all hit well while Pedro Mart nez put up his usual outstanding numbers Derek Lowe newly converted into a starter won 20 games becoming the first player to save 20 games and win 20 games in back to back seasons After failing to reach the playoffs Port was replaced by Yale University graduate The o Epstein Epstein raised in Brookline Massachusetts and just 28 at the time of his hiring became the youngest general manager in MLB history The 2003 team was known as the Cowboy Up team a nickname derived from first baseman Kevin Millar's challenge to his teammates to show more determination 117 In the 2003 American League Division Series the Red Sox rallied from a 0 2 series deficit against the Athletics to win the best of five series Derek Lowe returned to his former relief pitching role to save Game 5 a 4 3 victory The team then faced the Yankees in the 2003 American League Championship Series In Game 7 Boston led 5 2 in the eighth inning but Pedro Mart nez allowed three runs to tie the game The Red Sox could not score off Mariano River a over the last three innings and eventually lost the game 6 5 when Yankee third baseman Aaron Boone hit a solo home run off Tim Wakefield Some placed the blame for the loss on manager Grady Little 118 for failing to remove starting pitcher Mart nez in the 8 th inning after some observers believe he began to show signs of tiring It was stated by Epstein that the decision to not renew Little's contract was made on a body of work after careful contemplation of the big picture did not depend on any one decision in any one postseason game 119 Boston would hire former Philadelphia Phillies manager Terry Francon a to manage the 2004 season During the 2003 04 offseason the Red Sox acquired another ace pitcher Curt Schilling and a closer Keith Foulke Due to some midseason struggles with injuries management shook up the team at the July 31 trading deadline as part of a four team trade The Red Sox traded the team's popular yet of t injured shortstop No mar Garciaparra and outfielder Matt Murton to the Chicago Cubs and received first baseman Doug Mien t kiew i cz from the Minnesota Twins and shortstop Orlando Cabrera from the Montreal Expos In a separate transaction the Red Sox acquired center fielder Dave Roberts from the Los Angeles Dodgers Following the trades the club won 22 out of 25 games and qualified for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card Players and fans affectionately referred to the players as the Idiots a term coined by Damon and Millar during the playoff push to describe the team's eclectic roster and devil may care attitude toward their supposed curse Boston began the postseason by sweeping the AL West champion Anaheim Angels in the A LDS In the third game of the series David Ortiz hit a walk off two run homer in the 10 th inning to win the game and the series to advance to a rematch of the previous year's ALCS in the ALCS against the Yankees The ALCS started very poorly for the Red Sox as they lost the first three games including a crushing 19 8 home loss in game 3 In Game 4 the Red Sox found themselves facing elimination trailing 4 3 in the ninth with Mariano River a in to close for the Yankees After River a issued a walk to Millar Roberts came on to pinch run and promptly stole second base He then scored on an RBI single by Bill Mueller sending the game into extra innings The Red Sox went on to win the game 6 4 on a two run home run by Ortiz in the 12 th inning The odds were still very much against the Sox in the series but Ortiz also made the walk off hit in the 14 th inning of Game 5 The comeback continued with a victory from an injured Schilling in Game 6 Three sutures being used to stabilize the tendon in Schilling's right ankle bled throughout the game famously making his sock appear bloody red With it Boston became the first team in MLB history to force a series deciding Game 7 after trailing 3 0 in games The Red Sox completed their historic comeback in Game 7 with a 10 3 victory over the Yankees Ortiz began the scoring with a two run homer Along with his game winning runs batted in during games 4 and 5 he was named ALCS Most Valuable Player The Red Sox joined the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs and the 1975 New York Islanders as the only North American professional sports teams in history at the time to win a best of seven games series after being down 3 0 The 2010 Philadelphia Flyers and the 2014 Los Angeles Kings would later accomplish the feat The Red Sox swept the St Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series The Red Sox never trailed throughout the series Mark Bell horn hit a game winning home run off Pesky's Pole in game 1 and Schilling pitched another bloodied sock victory in game 2 followed by similarly masterful pitching performances by Martinez and Derek Lowe It was the Red Sox ' first championship in 86 years Manny Ram rez was named World Series MVP To add a final surreal touch to Boston's championship season on the night of Game 4 a total lunar eclipse colored the moon red over Busch Stadium The Red Sox earned many accolades from the sports media and throughout the nation for their season such as in December when Sports Illustrated named the Boston Red Sox the 2004 Sportsmen of the Year The 2005 AL East was decided on the last weekend of the season with the Yankees coming to Fenway Park with a one game lead in the standings The Red Sox won two of the three games to finish the season with the same record as the Yankees 95 67 However a playoff was not needed as the loser of such a playoff would still make the playoffs as a wild card team As the Yankees had won the season series they were awarded the division title and the Red Sox competed in the playoffs as the wild card team Boston failed to defend their championship and was swept in three games by the eventual 2005 World Series champion Chicago White Sox in the first round of the playoffs In 2006 David Ortiz broke Jimmie Foxx's single season Red Sox home run record by hitting 54 homers However Boston failed to make the playoffs after compiling a 9 21 record in the month of August due to several injuries in the club's roster The o Epstein's first step toward restocking the team for 2007 was to pursue one of the most anticipated acquisitions in baseball history On November 14 MLB announced that Boston had won the bid for the rights to negotiate a contract with Japanese Nippon Professional Baseball superstar pitcher Daisuke Matsu zak a Boston placed a bid of 51 1 million to negotiate with Matsu zak a and completed a 6 year 52 million contract after they were announced as the winning bid The Red Sox moved into first place in the AL East by mid April and never relinquished their division lead Initially rookie second baseman Dustin Pedroia under performed hitting below 200 in April Manager Terry Francon a refused to bench him and his patience paid off as Pedroia eventually won the AL Rookie of the Year Award for his performance that season which included 165 hits and a 317 batting average On the mound Josh Beckett emerged as the ace of the staff with his first 20 win season as fellow starting pitchers Schilling Matsu zak a Wakefield and Juli n Ta v rez all struggled at times Relief pitcher Hideki Oka jima another recent arrival from the NPB posted an ERA of 0 88 through the first half and was selected for the All Star Game Oka jima finished the season with a 2 22 ERA and 5 saves emerging as one of baseball's top relieve rs Minor league call up Clay Buchholz provided a spark on September 1 by pitching a no hitter in his second career start The Red Sox captured their first AL East title since 1995 The Red Sox swept the Angels in the A LDS Facing the Cleveland Indians in the ALCS the Red Sox fell in games 2 3 and 4 before Beckett picked up his second victory of the series in game 5 starting a comeback The Red Sox captured their twelfth American League pennant by out scoring the Indians 30 5 over the final three games The Red Sox faced the Colorado Rockies in the 2007 World Series and swept the Rockies in four games In Game 4 Wakefield gave up his spot in the rotation to a recovered Jon Lester who gave the Red Sox an impressive start pitching 5 2 3 shutout innings Key home runs late in the game by third baseman Mike Lowell and pinch hitter Bobby Kiel ty secured the Red Sox ' second title in four years as Lowell was named Most Valuable Player in the World Series The Red Sox began their season by participating in the third opening day game in MLB history to be played in Japan where they defeated the Oakland A's in the Tokyo Dome On May 19 Jon Lester threw the 18 th no hitter in team history defeating the Kansas City Royals 7 0 Down the stretch outfielder Manny Ramirez became embroiled in controversy surrounding public incidents with fellow players and other team employees as well as criticism of ownership and not playing which some claimed was due to laziness and nonexistent injuries The front office decided to move the disgruntled outfielder at the July 31 trade deadline shipping him to the Dodgers in a three way deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates that landed them Jason Bay to replace him in left field 120 With Ramirez gone and Bay providing a new spark in the lineup the Red Sox improved vastly and made the playoffs as the AL Wild Card The Red Sox defeated the Angels in the 2008 A LDS three games to one The Red Sox then took on their AL East rivals the Tampa Bay Rays in the ALCS Down three games to one in the 5 th game of the ALCS Boston mounted a comeback from trailing 7 0 in the 7 th inning to win 8 7 121 122 They tied the series at three games a piece with a Game 6 victory before losing Game 7 3 1 thus becoming the eighth team in a row since 2000 to fail to repeat as World Series champions The Red Sox returned to postseason play in 2009 but were swept in the A LDS by the Los Angeles Angels In 2010 they placed third in the division and failed to make the playoffs In 2011 the Red Sox collapsed becoming the first team in MLB history to blow a 9 game lead in the division heading into September going 7 20 in the final month and failing again to make the playoffs In December 2011 Bobby Valentine was hired as a new manager The 2012 season marked the centennial of Fenway Park and on April 20 past and present Red Sox players and coaches assembled to celebrate the park's anniversary However the collapse that they endured in September 2011 carried over into the season The Red Sox struggled throughout the season due to injuries inconsistent play and off field news They finished 69 93 for their first losing season since 1997 and their worst season since 1965 Boston which finished last in the American League East with a 69 93 record in 2012 26 games behind the Yankees became the 11 th team in major league history to go from worst in the division to first the next season when it clinched the A L East division title on September 20 2013 123 Many credit the team's turnaround with the hiring of manager John Farrell the former Red Sox pitching coach under Terry Francon a from 2007 to 2010 As a former member of the staff he had the respect of influential players such as Lester Pedroia and Ortiz 124 But there were other moves made in the offseason by general manager Ben Che ring ton who targeted character players to fill the team's needs These acquisitions included veteran catcher David Ross Jonny Gomes Mike Napoli and Shane Victor in o While some questioned these players as re treads it was clear that Che ring ton was trying to move past 2011 2012 by bringing in clubhouse players Essential to the turnaround however was the pitching staff With ace veteran John Lackey coming off Tommy John surgery and both Jon Lester and Clay Buchholz returning to their prior form this allowed the team to rely less on their bullpen Everything seemed in danger of collapsing however when both closer s Joel Hanrahan and Andrew Bailey went down early with season ending injuries Farrell gave the closing job to Koji Uehara on June 21 who delivered with a 1 09 ERA and an MLB record 0 565 WHIP 125 On September 11 the 37 year old right hand er set a new Red Sox record when he retired 33 straight batters 126 Other reasons include the trade deadline acquisition of pitcher Jake Peavy when the Red Sox were in second place in the AL East the depth of the bench with players such as Mike Carp and rookies Jackie Bradley Jr and Xander Bogaert s and the re emergence of players such as Will Middle brooks and Daniel Nava 124 On September 28 2013 the team secured home field advantage throughout the American League playoffs when their closest competition the Oakland Athletics lost 127 The next day the team finished the season going 97 65 the best record in the American League and tied with the St Louis Cardinals for the best record in baseball 128 They proceeded to defeat the St Louis Cardinals in the 2013 World Series four games to two 129 The Red Sox became the first team since the 1991 Minnesota Twins to win the World Series a year after finishing in last place and the second overall The 2012 Red Sox's 426 winning percentage was the lowest for a team in a season prior to a World Series championship Throughout the season the Red Sox players and organization formed a close association with the city of Boston and its people in relation to the Boston Marathon bombing that occurred on April 15 2013 On April 20 the day after the alleged bombers were captured David Ortiz gave a pre game speech following a ceremony honoring the victims and the local law enforcement in which he stated This is our fucking city And nobody is going to dictate our freedom Stay strong For the entirety of the season the team wore an additional arm patch that exhibited the Red Sox B logo and the word Strong within a blue circle The team also hung up in the dugout a custom jersey that read Boston Strong with the number 617 representing the city of Boston's area code On many occasions during the season victims of the attack and law enforcement involved were given the honor of throwing the ceremonial first pitch Following their victory in the 2013 World Series the first one clinched at home in Fenway Park since 1918 Red Sox players Jonny Gomes and Jarrod Salta la macchi a performed a ceremony during the team's traditional duck boat victory parade in which they placed the World Series trophy and the custom 617 jersey on the Boston Marathon finish line on Boy l st on Street followed by a moment of silence and the singing of God Bless America This ceremony helped the city reclaim its spirit that was lost after the bombing 130 Overall the Red Sox team and organization played a role in the healing process after the tragedy owing to the team's unifying effect on the city 131 132 133 134 Following the 2013 championship the team finished last in the AL East during 2014 with a record of 71 91 and again in 2015 with a record of 78 84 On September 12 2015 David Ortiz hit his 500 th career home run off Matt Moore in Tropicana Field becoming the 27 th player in MLB history to achieve that prestigious milestone in November 2015 Ortiz announced that the 2016 season was to be his last 135 The Red Sox had a record of 93 69 and won their division in 2016 with six American League All Stars the AL Cy Young Award winner in Rick Por cello and the runner up for the ALMost Valuable Player Award Mook ie Betts Rookie Andrew Ben intend i established himself in the Red Sox outfield and Steven Wright emerged as one of the year's biggest surprises The Red Sox grabbed the lead in the AL East early and held on to it throughout the year which included many teams honoring Ortiz throughout the season Despite the success the team lost five of their last six games of the regular season and were swept in the A LDS by the eventual American League Champion Cleveland Indians 136 The Red Sox once again finished with a record of 93 69 in 2017 and repeated as division champions The team went 5 5 in their last ten regular season games and were eliminated by the Houston Astros in the A LDS in four games 137 The Red Sox subsequently fired their manager John Farrell and hired Alex Cora signing him to a three year deal 138 The Red Sox finished with a 108 54 667 record winning the American League East division title for the third consecutive season eight games ahead of the second place New York Yankees 139 and were the first team to clinch a berth in the 2018 postseason 140 The Red Sox surpassed the 100 win mark for the first time since 1946 broke the franchise record of 105 wins that had been set in 1912 and won the most games of any MLB team since the 2001 Seattle Mariners won 116 141 The 2018 Red Sox were led by All Stars Mook ie Betts J D Martinez Chris Sale and Craig Kim brel Betts led baseball in batting average and slugging percentage while Martinez led in runs batted in Sale tossed only 158 innings due to a shoulder injury late in the year but was otherwise superb posting a 2 11 earned run average to go along with 237 strikeouts Kim brel saved 42 games and struck out 96 batters The Red Sox entered the postseason as the top seed in the American League and defeated the New York Yankees 100 62 in four games in the Division Series 142 Next they defeated the defending champion Houston Astros 103 59 in five games in the League Championship Series 143 Boston then defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 92 71 in five games in the World Series for the team's fourth championship in 15 years and ninth in franchise history The team's motto during the season do damage 144 became damage done upon their victory 145 Based on these exploits the team is considered the best MLB team of the 2010 s one of the best Red Sox teams ever and one of the best baseball teams since the 1998 New York Yankees 146 147 148 149 Despite retaining most players from the 2018 championship team the 2019 Red Sox won 24 fewer games finishing third in the division and missing the playoffs for the first time since 2015 President of Baseball Operations Dave Dom browski was dismissed following a September loss to the Yankees 150 On October 28 the Red Sox hired Chaim Bloom as his replacement on a five year contract with the title of Chief Baseball Officer 151 On January 7 2020 it was reported in The Athletic that the Red Sox had used their video replay room to steal signs during their 2018 season 152 On January 15 the Red Sox and manager Alex Cora agreed to mutually part ways after he was named in the MLB's report about the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal which occurred during his tenure as bench coach with the 2017 Astros 153 Ron Roenick e was subsequently named Boston's interim manager 154 On February 10 a trade of Mook ie Betts and David Price to the Los Angeles Dodgers was made official 155 in a move seen as a salary dump by analysts 156 although denied by Red Sox executives 157 In March the start of the MLB season was indefinitely postponed due to the C OVID 19 pandemic In April the MLB's investigation into 2018 sign stealing resulted in a finding of improper actions by the team's replay operator who as a result was suspended for the 2020 season and the team forfeited their second round selection in the 2020 MLB draft 158 The interim tag was subsequently removed from Roenick e's title 159 The team struggled throughout their abbreviated 60 game regular season contested July 24 through September 27 finishing in last place in the AL East division with a record of 24 36 160 Prior to the final regular season game management announced that Roenick e would not return as manager for the 2021 season 161 Alex Cora returned as manager for the 2021 season 162 with the team finishing at 92 70 and qualifying for the postseason as the fourth seed in the AL 163 The Red Sox defeated the Yankees in the AL Wild Card Game 164 and defeated the Rays in the Division Series 165 but were eliminated by the Astros in the League Championship Series 166 The 2022 season was much less successful with the team finishing in last place within their division with a 78 84 record the first losing

replacement Craig Breslow an executive with the Chicago Cubs and former pitcher for the Red Sox was hired on October 25 2023 171 Expectations were not high going into Breslow's first year at the helm 172 Many analysts and fans throughout the game believed that the Red Sox hadn't done enough throughout the 2024 offseason to improve their roster especially after chairman Tom Werner claimed the team would go full throttle 173 The frustration even reached the players with star player Rafael De vers publicly voicing out his frustration with the team for not doing enough 174 This led to much speculation around baseball believing that John Henry's interest in the team had waned especially due to his ventures into other sports 175 176 However despite a mediocre 81 812024 season where the Red Sox once again missed the playoffs there was some upside with major prospects Kristian Campbell Marcelo Mayer and Roman Anthony making national headlines and center fielder Jarre n Duran winning the All Star Game MVP Going into the 2024 25 offseason Red Sox fans were hoping to push forward and make more improvements than the last offseason Although the offseason started off slow the Red Sox made two major moves to improve their team trading for White Sox ace Garrett Crochet who would start for them on Opening Day and signing third baseman Alex Bregman to a three year 120 million dollar deal The Red Sox flipped the script and entered the 2025 season as contenders for the American League title 177 Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager Coaches The Red Sox have played their

to have his number retired on their website and in their annual media guides The requirements were as follows 212 These requirements were reconsidered after the election of Carlton Fisk to the Hall of Fame in 2000 who met the first two requirements but played the second half of his career with the Chicago White Sox As a means of meeting the criteria then GM Dan Duque tte hired Fisk for one day as a special assistant which allowed Fisk to technically finish his career with the Red Sox 213 In 2008 the Red Sox made an exception by retiring number 6 for Johnny Pesky Pesky neither spent ten years as a player nor was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame however Red Sox ownership cited his versatility of his contributions on the field off the field and in the dugout including as a manager scout and

many in baseball have for him 215 After announcing Mart nez's number retirement the official criteria no longer appeared on the team website 216 nor future media guides 217 218 In 2017 less than eight months after he played the final game of his illustrious career David Ortiz had his number 34 retired by the Red Sox Ortiz was elected to the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 2022 219 To date Ortiz is the only Red Sox player to have been on the active playoff roster of three World Series championship teams 2004 2007 2013 since the issuance of jersey numbers starting in 1931 220 The

in 1998 In commemoration of Jackie Robinson Day MLB invited players to wear the number 42 for games played on April 15 which Coco Crisp CF David Ortiz DH and DeM arlo Hale Coach did in 2007 and again in 2008 Starting in 2009 MLB had all uniformed players for all teams wear number 42 for Jackie Robinson Day While not officially retired the Red Sox have not issued several numbers since the departure of prominent figures who wore them specifically 221 There has also been debate in Boston media circles and among fans about the potential retiring of Tony Co nig liar o's number 25 222 223 Nonetheless since Co nig liar o's last full season in Boston 1970 the number has never been taken out of circulation and issued to multiple players notably Troy O ' Leary from 1995 to 2001 along with coach Dwight Evans in 2002 and manager Bobby Valentine in 2012 221 Until the late 1990 s the numbers originally hung on the right field facade in the order in which they were retired 9 4 1 8 It was pointed out that the numbers when read as a date 9 4 18 marked the eve of the first game of the 1918 World Series the last championship series that the Red Sox won before 2004 After the facade was repainted the numbers were rearranged in numerical order In 2012 the numbers were rearranged again in chronological order of retirement 9 4 1 8 27 6 14 followed by Robinson's 42 As additional numbers were retired Robinson's 42 was moved to the right so it remains the right most number hanging Luis A par i cio Adri n Beltr Wade Boggs Lou Boudreau Jesse Burke tt Orlando Cepeda Jack Che s bro Jimmy Collins Joe Cr
