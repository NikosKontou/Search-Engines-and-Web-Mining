minigames lets you take control of squares and recruit pirates for your ship's crew It uses the opening Map of the Heart Kok oro no Chi zu in the Japanese version The main style of gameplay is the Board Game which features a massive gameboard consisting of dozens of panels The objective of the game is to have as much money as possible when every tile belongs to a player Each player has two varieties of money the money earned from winning a minigame and the money earned from simply owning a panel Note that while the latter is easily increased and just as easily decreased only three effects in the entire game can affect the former Each of the four players take turns uncovering panels around the gameboard who goes first is determined by a minigame at the beginning that takes place at the center panel While at the beginning players can only uncover panels that are close to the central one as the game goes on more panels may be uncovered A panel owned by a player is marked by being bordered with the player's colors if the color is gray then nobody owns it and anyone can select it Similar to One Piece Grand Battle Rush some gameplay items and features were removed from the American version because the American version of the anime had not progressed as far as the Japanese version Everything past the Sky pie a Arc of the anime was removed and the soundtrack of the introduction of the game was changed because 4 Kids ' version of the anime never used any of the original theme songs There are 5 kinds of boards in the game each one representation a place from the

all the other players The winner of the minigame gains ownership of the panel Captain These panels when uncovered result in a special minigame where the player who uncovers them plays as the captain of the game and follows different rules than all the other players If the captain wins the player who uncovered the panel earns ownership of it while if one of the other players win they gain ownership of it Note that captain panels are always found in pairs and that if a player gains ownership of one the other is also revealed and brought under ownership of him her Similarly captain panels also change ownership get destroyed get frozen in unison Note that if two panels of the same color are in line with one another all uncovered panels between them with different colors switch to
