    "transformers_text": "Chibi , also known as super deformation ( SD ), is an art style originating in Japan , and common in anime and manga where characters are drawn in an exaggerated way, typically small and chubby with stubby limbs, oversized eyes, oversized heads, tiny noses, tiny bodies, and minimal detail. The style has found its way into the anime and manga fandom through its usage in manga works and merchandising.\n\nThe English term chibi derives from the Japanese chibi kyara ( ちびキャラ , ' tiny character ' ) , [ 1 ] where chibi ( ちび ) is a colloquial word for very short people and children, itself deriving from chibiru ( 禿びる , v. ' to wear down ' ) , [ 2 ] and kyara ( キャラ ) is loaned from the English \"character\". [ 3 ]\n\n\"Super deformed\" and \"S.D.\" come from Japanese deforume ( デフォルメ , ' stylistic distortion ' ) , itself from French déformer . [ 4 ]\n\nCompared to the average anime character, usually about seven to eight heads tall, [ 5 ] the head of a super-deformed character is normally anywhere between one third and one half the character's height. [ 6 ] In addition to their modified proportions, super-deformed characters typically lack the detail of their normal counterparts. As a result, when a character of average proportions is depicted as a super-deformed character, certain aspects of their design will be simplified and others will be more exaggerated. Details such as folds on a jacket are ignored, and general shapes are favored. If a character has a signature characteristic (odd hair, a particular accessory, etc.) this will typically be prominent in the super deformed version of the character. [ 7 ]\n\nThe chibi style easily falls under the Japanese category of kawaii, with the specific proportions being exaggerated in the ways that they are. With it being widely regarded as cute, the chibi style allows for easy advertisement in the culture, and even in other countries. [ 8 ]\n\nOne example of the word's usage in Japanese media, which brought the term to the attention of American fans in the mid-1990s, is Chibiusa ; this diminutive pet name for the daughter of Sailor Moon comes from Chibi Usagi (\"Little Rabbit\"). [ 9 ] The chibi art style is part of the Japanese kawaii subculture. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Outside of Japan, the chibi style has also appeared in anime-influenced American series such as Teen Titans , Avatar: The Last Airbender , and Homestuck . [ 13 ]",
