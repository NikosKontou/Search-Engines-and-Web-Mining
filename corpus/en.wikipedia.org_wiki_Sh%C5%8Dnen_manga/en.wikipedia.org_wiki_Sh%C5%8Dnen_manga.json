    "transformers_text": "Sh nen manga lit boys ' comics also romanized as shonen shounen or sy nen is an editorial category of Japanese comics targeting an audience of both adolescent boys and young men It is along with sh jo manga targeting adolescent girls and young women seinen manga targeting young adults and adult men and josei manga targeting adult women one of the primary demographic categories of manga and by extension of Japanese anime Sh nen manga is traditionally published in dedicated manga magazines that often almost exclusively target the sh nen demographic group Of the four primary demographic categories of manga sh nen is the most popular category in the Japanese market While sh nen manga ostensibly targets an audience of young males its actual readership extends significantly beyond this target group to include all ages and genders The category originated from Japanese children's magazines at the turn of the 20 th century and gained significant popularity by the 1920 s The editorial focus of sh nen manga is primarily on action adventure and the fighting of monsters or other clearly defined forces of evil Though action narratives dominate the said category there is deep editorial diversity and a significant number of genres and sub genres within sh nen manga especially compared to other comic cultures outside of Japan including comedy crime romance slice of life and sports The Japanese words h nen o nen lit few years meaning young boy 1 historically referred to juveniles in a general sense and was used by the Japanese publishing industry until the end of the 19 th century to designate publications aimed at children and young people The word shifted to its current usage of referring specifically to media aimed at adolescent boys beginning with the practice of segmenting periodicals especially manga magazines by sex and age specific target groups which was established at the beginning of the 20 th century and accelerated starting in the 1960 s This segmentation system is now openly used as a categorization system by manga publishers 2 3 and extends into works that are adapted from manga such as anime 4 Sh nen manga refers to manga aimed at an audience of adolescent boys with the primary target audience alternately defined as 10 to 19 years old 5 and as 12 to 21 years old 6 It is the most popular category in the Japanese market of the four primary demographic categories of manga sh nen sh jo seinen and josei 7 8 The actual readership of sh nen manga as is the case for all demographic categories of manga 8 9 extends significantly beyond this adolescent male target group to include all ages and genders 10 For example a 2006 survey of female manga readers found that Weekly Sh nen Jump was the most popular manga magazine among this demographic placing ahead of magazines that specifically target a female readership 3 The target group orientation of sh nen manga is particularly evident in the non manga content of sh nen manga magazines which include advertising and articles on topics tailored to the interests of young males such as video games Non manga content often corresponds to a major manga series in a given magazine for example advertisements for a video game adaptation of the series or articles about an animated film adaptation of the series 8 11 Children's magazines with sex segregated readerships have existed in Japan since the early 1900 s While early youth magazines were ostensibly unisex Sh nen Se kai was the first youth magazine in Japan in 1895 targeting a readership of both boys and girls 3 in practice the editorial content of these publications largely concerned topics that were thought to be of interest to boys 12 This provoked the emergence of first exclusively sh jo girls magazines in 1902 and sh nen magazines subsequently began to exclusively target a male audience 3 Initially these magazines did not publish manga 13 The first sh nen magazine to do so was Sh nen Pakku first published in 1907 This was followed by Sh nen Club in 1914 and later Y nen Club Among the most successful and influential manga series in these early sh nen magazines were Nora kuro by Sui h Tag awa which follows the life of an anthropomorphic dog soldier and Tank Tank uro by Ga jo Sakamoto about a robot like character who can change his appearance 14 Sh nen magazines enjoyed significant popularity during the 1920 s and 1930 s with Y nen Club selling over 950 000 copies During the Second Sino Japanese War and Second World War magazine sales declined and publications were used increasingly for wartime propaganda purposes The manga content in these publications was reduced 15 and the series that remained typically focused on patriotic and militaristic themes such as stories about samurai In other stories robots were depicted as fighting in the war against the Allied forces as analogous to western superhero comics that depicted superheroes fighting the Axis powers during this same period 15 During the post war occupation of Japan the Japanese publishing industry was rebuilt under initially strict guidelines Stories focused on war combat and most competitive sports were banned with the aim of discouraging belligerence and hindering the use of manga for pro Imperial propaganda 16 Manga developed during this period under the influence of artist Osamu Tezuka with series such as Astro Boy and Kimba the White Lion 17 18 Tezuka was inspired by American cartoons and pioneered the so called story manga long running manga series with a cinematic style and continuity across multiple chapters contrasting what had previously been a medium defined by one off comic strips 10 Science fiction stories about robots space travel and heroic space faring adventures enjoyed popularity during this period 19 16 many sci fi stories took themes and concepts from war comics and re imagined them with pacifist ideals such asTet sujin 28 go by Mit suter u Yokoyama 16 One of the first new sh nen manga magazines of the post war period was Manga Sh nen which launched in 1947 and published works by Tezuka L eiji Matsumoto and Sh tar Is hino mori 20 8 As post war censorship codes were repealed and Japan entered a period of significant economic development in the 1950 s sales of manga and the number of manga magazines increased significantly and sh nen and sh jo manga came to further establish themselves as distinct categories 10 The first works of sports manga also emerged from sh nen manga during this time notable early works include Ig aguri kun jp by Ei ichi Fukui as the first manga series in the genre 10 and As hit a no Joe by A sao Takamori and Tetsuya Chiba which became one of the most commercially successful works in the genre 16 1959 saw the launch of Sh nen Sunday and Weekly Sh nen Magazine the first weekly sh nen manga magazines 21 8 Other weeklies such as Sh nen Champion Sh nen King and Sh nen Ace emerged in the 1960 s 10 16 Weekly Sh nen Jump was first published in 1968 and would establish itself as the best selling manga magazine across demographic categories a position it holds to this day Many of the most popular and commercially successful sh nen series originated in Weekly Sh nen Jump including Dragon Ball by Akira Toriyama Naruto by Masashi Kishimoto Bleach by Tite Kubo One Piece by Eiichiro Oda and Slam Dunk by Take hi ko Inoue 8 Seinen manga became formalized as a category of manga aimed at an older male audience in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s and many sh nen artists associated with the realist g ekiga movement migrated to seinen manga The demise of the kashi hon rental manga market led many kashi hon artists to move into magazine publishing including sh nen manga bringing their distinct themes and style with them As a result sh nen manga came to deal with more serious and political themes and saw an increase in depictions of violent and explicit subjects as well as an increase in profanity Significant artists of this era include Shigeru Mizuki 21 creator of the horror series Ge Ge Ge no Kitar and George A kiyama whose sh nen manga series A shura depicts cannibalism child abuse and mass murder 22 Although this provoked a public backlash it did not lead to the decline for the industry series with anarchic offensive humor became popular in sh nen and seinen manga a like with Crayon Shin Chan by Yoshito Usui becoming an internationally famous example of this phenomenon 10 Manga artist Go Nagai originated the sexually charged ecchi genre with Hare n chi Gaku en which was serialized in Weekly Sh nen Jump 23 The stylistic and thematic differences between sh nen and sh jo began to narrow considerably beginning in the 1980 s with widespread exchange of stylistic devices and themes For example the characteristic large eyes of sh jo manga became common in sh nen manga to convey the emotions of characters and female characters have enjoyed greater prominence as both supporting and primary characters in sh nen manga Other graphic storytelling techniques that originated in sh jo manga such as montages of multiple panels were imported in tosh nen manga and have become common stylistic devices 24 In the 1980 s combat focused battle manga stories became popular with Dragon Ball and Fist of the North Star emerging as representative works of this development Manga critic Jason Thompson credits the success of Dragon Ball first published in 1984 as originating a trend that has persisted to contemporary sh nen manga of favoring cartoonish art styles over the more mature art styles of sh n entitles such as City Hunter and Fist of the North Star 25 Female manga artists also began to enjoy increasing critical and commercial success as sh nen manga creators 26 As a result of the combined influence of ecchi and the rise of female artists romance emerged as a subgenre of sh nen manga especially romantic comedy 27 28 When manga began to emerge in the Western world in the early 1990 s the sh nen category was so dominant in these new markets that it came to shape the image of manga as a whole 24 While sh jo made gains in popularity by the 2000 s sh nen remains the most popular category of manga both in Japan and internationally 27 This thematic orientation of sh nen manga is readily inferred from the formal values or slogans that sh nen manga magazines assign themselves for example friendship perseverance and victory for Weekly Sh nen Jump 29 and courage friendship and fighting spirit for Coro Coro Comic 30 The editorial focus of sh nen manga is primarily on action adventure and the fighting of monsters or other forces of evil 31 Action stories are so dominant in sh nen manga that some manga and non manga works are occasionally designated as sh nen not because of their ostensible target group but because of their content focus on action and adventure 32 Though action narratives dominate the category there is deep editorial diversity and a significant number of genres and subgenres within sh nen manga especially when compared to other comic cultures outside of Japan 16 This includes but is not limited to comedy crime romance slice of life and stories about activities such as sports and the lives of different types of working professionals 8 The action genre is itself is expressed through a variety of subgenres from historical and contemporary drama to science fiction and fantasy 8 Sh nen war fiction has been alternately jingoistic or critical of militarism and violence with Barefoot Gen by Keiji Nakazawa as a notable example of the latter 33 Samurai appeared frequently as idealized role models for boy readers in early sh nen analogous to representations of cowboys in western comics samurai stories shifted to comedy and sportsmanship in the post war period before returning to themes of idealized themes of good versus evil 34 Though sh nen manga typically attempts to convey a message of peace the category has been criticized by individuals such as director Hayao Miyazaki for promoting overly simple good evil dichotomies 35 Ash nen protagonist is often characterized by contradictory qualities short tempered and cool mischievous and rebellious serious and cynical clumsy and infallible or who appears as a good for nothing but possesses hidden abilities In some cases the contradiction takes on a literal form in the form of he nsh in lit ' transformation ' where the hero is able to switch between two person as with different appearances and personalities examples of this device include Yu Gi Oh by Kazuki Takahashi and Samurai Deeper Kyo by Aki mine Kami j yo Transformation abilities are often linked with bonds to a spirit monster or robot 8 A major narrative device in sh nen manga is rivalry between the protagonist and his opponent 36 with a fight or a quest often appearing as a central element Dragon Ball is among the most popular and commercially successful examples of this archetypal story 37 Typically ash nen protagonist is an outsider or in some way disadvantaged compared to others but who through training perseverance and willpower eventually succeeds against all odds 16 Plots typically follow the basic structure of the hero's journey with much of the story focused on the protagonist's training and transformation into a hero and on characters who earn their status as heroes through effort and tenacity rather than by virtue of birth or assignment For long running series the hero's journey repeats itself as a new story arc begins the enemy becomes more powerful and the danger to be overcome becomes greater 27 In addition to these external conflicts ash nen protagonist often also faces internal conflicts typically focused around maturity and growing older 27 In contrast tosh jo manga which often focuses on the thoughts and interior monologue of the hero sh nen typically advances plot through dialogue and action 24 36 Happy endings are common in sh nen manga but are not obligatory 8 Comics theorist Neil Cohn regards the art style of sh nen as generally edgier than that of sh jo manga and notes how most regular manga readers are able to easily distinguish between sh nen and sh jo based on visual appearance alone 38 Visually ash nen protagonist often possesses what manga critic Jason Thompson describes as insanely spiky hair that distinguishes the protagonist's silhouette from that of other characters 8 The eyes of sh nen characters in the post war period are significantly smaller than those of characters in sh jo manga large eyes are used in sh jo manga to better convey the emotions of the characters an aspect which has historically been given less focus in sh nen manga 36 A common visual device in sh nen action scenes is to depict the contours of figures with rough coarse motion lines to give the appearance of movement 39 Historically the protagonists of sh nen manga were almost exclusively men and boys women and girls appeared primarily in supporting roles as sisters mothers or girlfriends if at all This was especially true of ecchi stories that developed out of sh nen manga beginning in the 1970 s with The A bashir i Family by Go Nagai as one of the earliest representative works of this development as well as an early example of ash nen manga with a female protagonist Since the 1980 s women and girls have played a more active role in sh nen manga fighting alongside male characters and not merely as passive support 40 Dr Slump by Akira Toriyama was an early representative work of this development with its mischievous child protagonist A rale Nori maki being among the first sh nen manga to depict this type of archetypal character as a girl rather than a boy The 1980 s also saw females h nen manga artists rise to greater prominence notably horror manga artist Kei Kusunoki and Rumiko Takahashi with her romantic comedies Urusei Yatsura and Ranma 41 Especially in sh nen series that are aimed at an older audience female characters are often presented in a manner that is attractive to the male target audience as b ish jos literally beautiful young girls They exist as objects of romantic or sexual desire not merely for the male characters but also for the ostensibly heterosexual male reader as a form of fan service 42 While these object if ying tropes have persisted in sh nen manga women have also developed more active roles in these fan service oriented stories A common romantic comedy trope in sh nen manga since the 1980 s has been to pair a weak male protagonist with a strong female love interest who is not only the target of his romantic and sexual desire but also his good friend and confidante 40 In the harem genre which originated from sh nen manga a male protagonist is surrounded by several female characters who desire him and who are often more confident and assertive than he is examples include Negima Magister Ne gi Magi by Ken Akamatsu and Hanau kyo Maid Team by Mori shi ge In other cases the male protagonist is unsuccessful in his attempts to woo the female character or the story is focused around the originally na ve and infantile male protagonist maturing and learning how to develop healthy relationships with women 43 For certain sh nen series a female readership who read in or interpret sub textual homo erotic relationships between canonical ly heterosexual male characters constitute a significant proportion of the series ' audience this is especially true of series featuring male characters who are b ish nen literally beautiful boys or who are perceived as such by readers This reading of sh nen manga is expressed in the form of fan works such as d j in shi self published amateur manga and the boys ' love BL genre of manga and anime which includes both original and derivative works Manga scholar Yukari Fujimoto notes in her analysis of the female readership of the sh n entitles One Piece Naruto and The Prince of Tennis that homo erotic interpretations of sh nen manga tend to be most common among titles that do not include prominent female characters that a female readership is able to identify with 44 Sh nen manga is traditionally published in dedicated manga magazines that specifically target an audience of sh nen At the industry's peak in the mid 1990 s there were 23 total sh nen magazines which collectively sold 662 million copies in 1995 The total manga magazine market that year included 265 magazines with a total of 1 595 billion copies sold 30 A manga magazine is typically several hundred pages long and contains over a dozen series or one shots 45 The largest Japanese sh nen magazines in terms of circulation are Weekly Sh nen Jump by Shueisha Weekly Sh nen Magazine by Kodansha and Weekly Sh nen Sunday by Sho gaku kan these publishers are also the largest publishers of manga generally The fourth largest magazine albeit by a significant margin is Weekly Sh nen Champion by Akita Shot en which was among the most popular manga magazines in the 1970 s and 1980 s 8 30 The magazines Coro Coro Comic and the now defunct Comic BomB om technically belong to the kod omo children's manga demographic but are often counted as sh nen magazines as they target an audience of school aged boys 8 30 A list of the top sh nen magazines by circulation as of 2015 are listed below 46 needs update",
