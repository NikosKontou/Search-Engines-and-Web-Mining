    "transformers_text": "Protesters Government of Nepal De centralised leadership In September 2025 large scale anti corruption protests and demonstrations took place across Nepal predominantly organized by Generation Z students and young citizens 8 Also known as the Gen Z protests a 9 they began following a nationwide ban on numerous social media platforms including YouTube Facebook and What s App and they incorporated the public's frustration with corruption and display of wealth by government officials and their families as well as allegations of mismanagement of public funds 10 11 The movement expanded to encompass broader issues of governance transparency and political accountability 12 13 14 15 The protests escalated with police violence against children and hospitals 16 protests against public officials and vandalism of government and political buildings taking place throughout the country On 9 September 2025 Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli along with a few government ministers resigned On 12 September Sushi la Kar ki was appointed as interim prime minister of Nepal The protests had died down by 13 September 17 18 At least 76 people were killed of these one was a 12 year old child and at least 19 were young students At least 34 protesters died from gunshot wounds 16 On 4 September 2025 the Government of Nepal ordered the shutdown of 26 social media platforms including Facebook X YouTube Linked In Reddit Signal and Snap chat for failing to register under the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology's new rules 14 According to People's Dispatch the registration requirement had been motivated in part as a way to enable the enforcement of a new Digital Services Tax and stricter value added tax rules on foreign e service providers in an effort to boost revenue 19 better source needed However critics alleged the shutdown was prompted by a social media trend highlighting nepotism focusing on the undue privileges enjoyed by the children and relatives of influential political leaders 20 According to People's Dispatch the media platform ban had a significant impact on Nepalese political economy 33 of the Nepalese GDP comes from remittances with hundreds of thousands of exit permits being issued alongside 20 youth unemployment These remittances keep thousands of households afloat and pay import bills and also indicate a lack of structural transformation in the domestic economy toward an employment first model pushing the youth into work in online spaces 19 better source needed Banning social media thus threatened youth livelihood citation needed Prior to the protests the average Nepali citizen made US 1 400 per year 21 while families of the country's ruling elite displayed their wealth on social media This Ne po Kid trend prompted significant public anger particularly from Generation Z users 20 22 The median age of Nepal's population is 25 meaning that a large part of the population is in Gen Z the age group that uses social media the most This relatively young population combined with the country's largely rural rough terrain and substantial migration abroad leads Nepal to have some of the highest social media usage in South Asia 48 of Nepalese have a social media account while only 33 7 of Indians have a social media account 23 Youth participatory groups particularly Ham i Nepal 24 an on governmental organization used Discord online communities called servers in Discord b and Insta gram channels as central organising tools in the Gen Z protests 25 26 Anyone could join the Ham i Nepal Discord group making it vulnerable to trolls or people not living in Nepal 27 According to India Today messages in the Ham i Nepal discord advocated for violence against the Nepalese leadership 5 Tactical discussions on Discord included procurement and use of Molotov cocktails suggestions to seize ammunition from police stations and instructions on disabling aeroplane tyres using acetylene gas After police response led to 19 deaths organisers in some Discord servers asked members to stop attending classes They called for an indefinite closure of colleges and schools until the government accepted accountability for the fatalities 28 Protestors used VPN s and posted flyers with QR codes to evade the social media ban 29 After Oli's resignation the army's chiefs met with Ham i Nepal and asked them to suggest nominees for an interim leader who would oversee national elections On a Discord server with over 100 000 members 27 more than 10 000 users 26 met virtually in a Discord channel c to debate After discussions several polls and the use of sub channels for fact checking 26 the members settled on Sushi la Kar ki S has wot La mich han e who established the Discord server 27 and served as a channel moderator was a recent graduate with a background in science and technology 30 He played a pivotal role in the technical coordination that underpinned these exercises in digital democracy explaining that the discussions were meant to simulate a mini election 27 Supporters of the process were seen by Al Jazeera English as viewing the online process as a revolutionary counter to the traditional practice of politicians choosing leaders behind closed doors which had displayed little transparency 26 Sudan Gurung founder of the youth organization Ham i Nepal and widely regarded as one of the central figures of the 2025 Gen Z protests emerged as a leading voice advocating for transparency and digital democracy Gurung coordinated online discussions through Discord and served as a liaison between protest organizers and the Nepali Army during the transition period that followed Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli's resignation 31 32 33 Large gatherings took place in Kathmandu 9 particularly atM a it i ghar Mandala and around the federal parliament building New Banes h wor with tens of thousands of participants 34 35 The protests were originally organized as a peaceful rally by Ham i Nepal 5 an NGO 36 37 whose website highlights earthquake relief projects 38 An il Bani ya one of the protest organisers from Ham i Nepal said the government cracked down on the protesters after Meg raj Giri another protester threw a rock at a CCTV camera Bani ya stated that what began as a peaceful protest was hijacked by external forces and political party cadres but that regardless the government should not have responded to stones being thrown with live ammunition from the armed police 21 The Straw Hat Pirates ' Jolly Roger flag from the manga series One Piece was used by some protesters in similar fashion to the 2025 Indonesian protests 39 The original protest grew and evolved to a movement with no formal leadership individuals joined voluntarily in opposition to corruption and the social media ban The demonstrations escalated when protesters attempted to enter the Federal Parliament of Nepal leading security forces to respond with tear gas water cannons rubber bullets and live ammunition 40 Video Geo location published in the evening showed numerous victims killed in front of the parliament building Victims were seen lying inanimate on the ground

including Kathmandu Bir gun j B hair a haw a But wal Pokhara It a hari and Dama k 47 Following this protests for the complete dissolution of parliament began This was primarily caused by the initial government response to the original protests 21 Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli began the day with a call to all parties to cease violent action but he did not respond to the corruption allegations 1 Then he directed his Communist Party of Nepal Unified Marxist Leninist ministers not to resign their posts and resigned his own office 1 48 Afterwards Oli fled to an army barracks outside of Kathmandu
