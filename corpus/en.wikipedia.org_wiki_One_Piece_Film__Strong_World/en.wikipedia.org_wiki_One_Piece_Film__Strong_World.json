animation and Oda's involvement in the film Chris Beveridge of The Fandom post described the film as a very streamlined Oda story that would have gone on for twenty or thirty episodes if it was done as a regular arc with the TV series adding that the storyline was predictable but also well polished Beveridge also praised the film for having a stronger connection to the One Piece TV series than the franchises previous films 29 Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network awarded the film a ' B ' rating praising the storyline and character design Silverman commented that no one can come up with weird laughs or monsters quite like Oda although unfavorably comparing some of the animation to stop motion animation Silverman also commented on the English dubbing of the film saying that Ian Sinclair's debut as Brook does a very good job with the loopy skeleton although she found Scott McNeil's pseudo Caribbean accent as Shiki a little off putting 30 Despite being largely unfamiliar with the franchise Kyle Mills of DVD Talk called FUNimation s release Highly Recommended praising the terrific cast of characters and giant kick as s final fight 31 Jeffrey Kauffman of Blu ray com also recommended Strong World describing it as loud frenetic and frequently nonsensical but also kind of crazily entertaining at the same time Kauffman also added that while Strong World won't necessarily be incomprehensible to newcomers those with a solid grounding in the background of the story and its many characters will reap the most rewards from this particular outing 32 It also currently has a rating of 7 1 out of 10 collated from both film critics and users on IMDb 33 It won the award for Excellent Animation of the Year at the 34 th Japan Academy Prize and is nominated for Animation of the
