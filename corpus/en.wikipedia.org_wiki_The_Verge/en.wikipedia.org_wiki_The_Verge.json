lay Patel although Patel acknowledged that he agreed with the legal argument that led to their removal 69 70 Timothy B Lee of Ars Technic a described this controversy as an example of the Streisand effect saying that while law regarding fair use is unclear regarding this type of situation the one legal precedent suggests that this kind of video is solidly within the bounds of copyright's fair use doctrine 66 Nearly three years after the erroneous build PC builder and YouTuber Linus Sebastian collaborated with Etienne in a video entitled Fixing the Verge PC build In the video Etienne admits not being an experienced builder when he assembled the PC having built only four computers at that point with The Verge build being his first on camera Etienne said before the video went live The
