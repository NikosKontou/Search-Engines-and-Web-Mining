    "transformers_text": "Hell Teacher: Jigoku Sensei Nube ( 地獄先生ぬ〜べ〜 , Jigoku Sensei Nūbē ) is a Japanese manga series written by Shō Makura [ ja ] and illustrated by Takeshi Okano . It was serialized in Shueisha 's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from August 1993 to May 1999, with its chapters collected in 31 tankōbon volumes. The series follows Meisuke Nueno, aka Nube, the homeroom teacher for Class 5–3 at Dōmori Elementary. More than a teacher, however, he is a skilled exorcist, protecting the town of Dōmori from supernatural threats with strength borrowed from a powerful demon sealed in his left hand—a technique he calls the Demon's Hand.\n\nA 49-episode anime television series, produced by Toei Animation , titled in English simply as Nube , [ 4 ] was broadcast on TV Asahi and its affiliates from April 1996 to August 1997. Three movies and three original video animation (OVA) episodes were released. A second anime television series adaptation, produced by Studio Kai , aired on the same channel from July to September 2025, with a second cours slated to premiere in January 2026.\n\nA spin-off manga series focused on Izuna Hazuki, the itako -girl, Reibaishi Izuna: The Spiritual Medium , was serialized from 2007 to 2011, with a sequel, Reibaishi Izuna: Ascension , published from 2011 to 2016. Other manga sequels to the main series have been released: Jigoku Sensei Nūbē Neo (2014–2018); Jigoku Sensei Nūbē S (2018–2021); Jigoku Sensei Nube Kai (since 2025); and Hell Teacher: Jigoku Sensei Nube Plus (2025).\n\nBy July 2024, the overall manga franchise had over 29 million copies in circulation .\n\nDōmori Elementary School appears ordinary until supernatural disturbances—often targeting a student from Class 5-3—force teacher Meisuke Nueno (Nube) into action. Using his Demon's Hand or other spiritual abilities, he resolves each incident, sometimes through combat, negotiation, or appeasement. Though largely episodic, the series features recurring antagonists and later introduces longer story arcs. Each case concludes with restored normalcy and a lesson learned.\n\nWritten by Shō Makura [ ja ] and illustrated by Takeshi Okano , Hell Teacher: Jigoku Sensei Nube was serialized in Shueisha 's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from August 24, 1993, [ 5 ] to May 11, 1999.
