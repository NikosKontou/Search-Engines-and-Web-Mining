    "transformers_text": "The Straw Hat Pirates' Jolly Roger ( Japanese : 麦わらの一味の海賊旗 , Hepburn : Mugiwara no Ichimi no Kaizokuki ) is a pirate flag predominantly featured in the Japanese One Piece manga and its anime franchise , wherein it is used to identify the Straw Hat Pirates , the pirate crew featuring the series' protagonists, who often fight for liberation of oppressed people.\n\nIt has become a symbol for youth-led protest movements globally such as the August 2025 Indonesian protests where people began using the flag in lieu of the national flag as a form of protest against the government, and the practice was emulated in other countries. Notably, the flag saw widespread use during protests in Nepal and Madagascar which overthrew their respective governments. The flag has also seen use in protests in other Asian countries, as well as in Africa, Europe, South America, Mexico and the United States.\n\nThe flag is a fictional Jolly Roger , depicting a cartoonish skull with two crossbones and a straw hat . In Eichiro Oda 's One Piece series, each pirate crew has its own distinct Jolly Roger that reflects its traits and beliefs. Although the flag was originally drawn by the main series protagonist Monkey D. Luffy , his poor sketch led one of his crewmates Usopp to redesign it. [ 1 ] One Piece itself is one of the longest-running and most popular Japanese media franchises, its manga (beginning publication in 1997) being the best-selling of all time and its anime running since 1999. [ 2 ]\n\nThe flag’s anti-authoritarian usage is a reference to a major storyline involving the fictional world government , which controls most of the manga’s locations, and the Straw Hat Pirates’ struggles to fight back, while concurrently hunting for the titular treasure. [ 3 ] As described by CNN , \"the flag symbolizes Luffy’s quest to chase his dreams, liberate oppressed people, and fight the autocratic World Government\". [ 4 ] Multiple academic works have analysed how the manga draws parallels to real world politics and authoritarianism. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]\n\nThe flag had been used in protests in Indonesia as early as October 2023 in Yogyakarta , during protests against the Gaza Genocide . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Student protesters in Indonesia begun flying the flag again in February 2025. [ 10 ] Truck drivers began flying the Straw Hat Pirates' flag in late July 2025 to protest the prohibition of ODOL (over dimension, overload) trucks throughout several cities in Java, ongoing since 19 June 2025. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ]\n\nThe flag came into prominence during the 2025 Indonesian anti-government protests which started in the weeks leading up to Independence Day on 17 August. [ 14 ] In July, President Prabowo Subianto had called on Indonesians to fly the red and white national flag to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the country's independence . Following the president's speech an apparel store received \"thousands of orders\" for the Jolly Roger flag, because \"The anime reflects the injustice and inequality that Indonesians experience\". [ 15 ]\n\nDuring large-scale protests and demonstrations were organized by Generation Z against government corruption in Nepal during September 2025, the flag became a key symbol. [ 16 ] [ 4 ] Protesters displayed the flag with slogans criticizing the luxurious lifestyles of politicians' children on social media. [ 4 ] Posts featuring the flag went viral on Nepalese social media, and its adoption quickly spread among protesters. One Nepalese protester interviewed by The Kathmandu Post remarked that the flag's use in Indonesian protests \"surely popularised its use in protests in Nepal\". [ 17 ] As the government of K. P. Sharma Oli was toppled by the protests, protesters hung the flag at the gates of the Singha Durbar palace as it burned. [ 4 ]\n\nMalagasy protesters in September–October 2025 used the symbol as a gesture against the government for inadequate water and power , with protesters using a variant of the flag with a pink-and-green satroka hat, traditional of the Betsileo people , in place of the regular straw hat. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] The icon was adopted by social media accounts associated with protesters. [ 10 ] By 11 October, the military CAPSAT unit had refused to fire on the protesters and they launched a coup the following day, resulting in the flight and later impeachment of President Andry Rajoelina . Protesters proceeded to hang the flag at the capital Antananarivo 's Place du 13 Mai. [ 19 ] Some protest leaders, opposed to the military takeover, began distributing T-shirts with the Malagasy variant of the flag to protesters after the coup. [ 20 ]\n\nThe Government of Indonesia , especially the leading figures from People's Consultative Assembly , [ 42 ] called the flag a threat to the national unity of Indonesia [ 43 ] and declared it a symbol of treason [ 44 ] and sedition . [ 45 ] Various government institutions, such as the Banten regional police, attempted to ban the flag. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Meanwhile, the deputy speaker of DPR Sufmi Dasco Ahmad [ 48 ] and West Java governor Dedi Mulyadi found no problem with its raising. [ 49 ] Minister of State Secretariat Prasetyo Hadi said that President Prabowo had no issues with protesters raising the flag and considered it as freedom of speech , but urged people not to \"compare it to, tarnish it, or put it in conflict with the Red and White flag \". [ 50 ]\n\nThe Guardian described the flag as \"a symbol of defiance and hope for gen Z protesters\" which has \"resonated across borders\". [ 51 ] Tokoro Ikuya ( 床呂郁哉 ), professor of Tokyo University of Foreign Studies who studies Japanese popular culture , indicated that the flag serves as \"an icon conveys a message that could be understood beyond minor different positions\". [ 52 ] Animanga expert Andrea Horbinski remarked that the flag was a natural uniting symbol, since Gen Z protesters knew that protesters would be familiar with it due to the series' popularity.
