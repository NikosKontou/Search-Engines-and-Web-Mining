    "transformers_text": "Bandai Co Ltd a is a Japanese multinational toy manufacturer and distributor headquartered in Tait Tokyo including many international branches around the world Since 2005 Bandai is the toy production division of Bandai Namco Holdings which in 2017 was the world's second largest toy company measured by total revenue 1 Between 1981 and 2001 Bandai was a manufacturer of video game consoles Bandai was founded by World War II veteran Nao haru Yama shina as Bandai Ya on July 5 1950 as the corporate spin off of a textile wholesaler The company began as a distributor of metallic toys and rubber swimming rings before moving to metal cars and aircraft models It was renamed Bandai Co Ltd in 1961 and achieved considerable success with its action figures based on the anime Astro Boy In 1947 Nao haru Yama shina began working for a Kanazawa based textile wholesaler 2 The eldest son to a rice retailer Yama shina had studied business in high school and was enlisted in World War II where an impact from a grenade shrapnel blinded him in his right eye 3 4 The textile business ran by his wife's brother was struggling financially as a result of Japan's post war economy 5 He made little money working and as he was having a difficult time finding ways to allow the business to pick up a neighbor told him about the potential of the toy industry and the financial success that could be generated from it 5 Intrigued Yama shina convinced his wife to travel to Tokyo with him to begin studying the potentially lucrative market for toys 4 With little money or exposure in the field the two worked long hours to establish a small toy distribution division within the textile business 2 Yama shina assumed full control of the toy division on July 5 1950 when it was spun off as a separate company named Bandai ya b in Tait Tokyo 2 6 The name was derived from Japanese reading of Chinese phrase bandai fu eki meaning eternally unchanging or things that are eternal which originated from the Chinese military text Six Secret Teachings in one of the seven military texts of the Seven Military Classics 2 3 7 Being assisted by A tsu ko Tatsu mi publisher of the Weekly Toy News in Tokyo Bandai ya distributed and imported celluloid dolls metallic toys and rubber swimming rings 2 4 The company released its first original product the same year the Rhythm Ball a beach ball with a bell inside that suffered from numerous quality defects 2 6 Bandai ya improved the quality of its products as it continued designing new kinds of toys such as inexpensive metal cars and aircraft models 4 7 Several of these were exported to the United States and elsewhere as a result of their popularity being among the earliest Made In Japan products exported outside the country 4 As its revenue increased Bandai ya began expanding its operations 4 A new shipping and warehouse facility was constructed in spring 1953 followed by research and development R D and product inspection departments later that year 4 A manufacturing facility War aku Works was opened in early 1955 to increase the production of toys 4 In the same year it implemented the toy industry's first quality assurance system the first toy approved by this was the 1956 Toyo pet Crown model car which was also Bandai ya's first product with a guarantee 6 8 The growing company worked on creating a friendly corporate image for itself introducing a new logo slogan and television commercials that emphasized its quality products 4 Bandai ya was renamed Bandai in July 1961 the same time it started spreading its operations overseas beginning with the establishment of Bandai Overseas Supply in New York City 6 8 While its toys often sold well in Japan Bandai didn't achieve considerable success until 1963 when it began producing action figures based on the anime Astro Boy 6 4 8 The toy line's success prompted Bandai to reorganize and rethink its business strategies as the company transitioned from working on original products to funding the creation of new television series and acting as a sponsor during their run with advertisements that showed off Bandai's tie in action figures and costumes 6 4 9 A similar blockbuster hit was found with action figures in the likenesses of Ultraman characters largely due to the popularity of the television series at the time the figures were later released in North America to little fanfare 4 In July 1966 it released Crazy Foam a line of bubble blowing canisters that sold 2 4 million units in three months thanks to the backing of an extensive marketing campaign 6 Bandai's other products included the Thunderbird electrical vehicles the Water Motor bath toys and the Naughty Flipper the last of which received a gold medal at the 1968 New York International Innovative productions Exhibition 8 An additional manufacturing plant was acquired in late 1969 to further increase the production of toys 4 Bandai continued its expansion throughout the 1970 s The company established a joint venture with model car manufacturer Tonka in 1970 and established Tonka Japan K K as part of Bandai's continuing mission in establishing ties with foreign companies A subsidiary named Pop y was formed a year later that specialized in the manufacturing of toys based on popular children's characters the subsidiary was originally intended for candy shops and other retail outlets outside of the usual toy stores Though Bandai became a major player in the Japanese toy industry competing with companies such a sT a kara and Epoch executives believed the company needed to further spread out into international territories to help increase worldwide brand awareness 10 Bandai Models was later established in 1971 11 who specialized in the manufacturing of toy characters 12 Although not their most profitable range Bandai's 1 48 scale A FV models dominated that segment of the model kit market Bandai America Inc was established as local US sales marketing operation in 1978 Space warp a line of build it yourself toy rolling ball roller coasters was introduced by Bandai in the 1980 s In May 1980 Makoto Yama shina son of the founder became president of Bandai Nao haru Yama shina became chairman of the board Upon his arrival Makoto Yama shina completely changed the ageing staff of Bandai and replaced them with younger employees with the intent of not only bringing new ideas but also revisiting the strategy of the group The new president took a different commercial approach by selling directly to retailers rather than going through intermediates 4 6 In July 1980 Bandai launched the ' Gundam Plastic Model ' based on the animated series Mobile Suit Gundam which gave birth to the Gun pla range of scale model kits 13 14 In November the subsidiary Ce lent was created 6 Bandai became one of the first third party developers for the Nintendo Family Computer in 1985 15 Among its first titles was Tag Team Match MUSCLE a video game adaptation of the Kinn i kum an manga which sold over one million copies 6 Bandai also produced the Family Trainer Pad released outside Japan as the Power Pad which also performed well commercially A series of games was released both in the US and in Japan including Athletic World and Stadium Events for the NES Shortly after its release Nintendo purchased the rights to the FFF mat in North America replacing it with their own redesign the Power Pad In order to maintain branding continuity Stadium Events was pulled from shelves after a short period of availability at Woolworth's stores Because the game was pulled from shelves and discontinued before many copies were sold Bandai's Stadium Events is universally accepted as the rarest licensed NES game released in North America 16 17 A shrink wrapped copy of the game sold for 41 270 on eBay in February 2010 18 The sister game to Stadium Events called Athletic World was initially released with a label that indicated compatibility with the Family Fun Fitness mat but was later re released with an updated label that mentions the Power Pad instead 19 Stadium Events was not released by name again but instead was slightly modified and relaunched as the Power Pad pack in game World Class Track Meet Since the 1980 s Bandai has become the leading toy company of Japan and to this day has the main toy licenses in Japan to popular properties including Dai kai ju Ultraman Super Robot Kamen Rider the Super Sentai and Power Rangers series which it took part in creating Gundam and many others In February 1989 it acquired arcade game developer Corel and and reorganized it into Ban presto which became Bandai's coin operated entertainment division 20 In the early 1990 s Bandai published games for Nintendo in the United Kingdom including Street Fighter II on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System 21 By 1989 Bandai celebrated its 39 th anniversary as Makoto Yama shina spoke of the name Bandai Land as a vision for a leisure facility modeled after Disney's theme parks when Bandai decided to shift its focus from being a toy company to an entertainment company like the above as the name Japan's Disney In that same year when Bandai suffered num eru o us financial troubles they established a partnership with video game publisher developer Cor land in order for Bandai to expand into the coin op industry as the former would allow themselves to launch a stronghold into the above genre 22 Later in that same year when Con land suffered similar financial constraints as they were having accumulated more than 1 5 billion in debt due to poor sales Bandai rather than dropping out of the struggling Con land deal they decided to majority acquire the company in February 1989 and had it reorganised as their own video game publishing development division Ban presto the name came from a portmanteau of Bandai and presto a word used to describe magic with Yu kum as a Su gia ra a member of Bandai's board of directors became president of the rebranded division 22 In February 1994 Bandai entered the film television animation production business by acquiring famous anime studio Sunrise the acquisition of Sunrise had gave Bandai their own official in house anime production studio as Bandai's management including Satoru Matsumoto joining the acquired studio 23 In 1993 Bandai entered the home video game console market by launching its own video game console called Play dia which was released exclusively in Japan However in that year Bandai planned to produce a second owned scaled down version of the Macintosh purely for CD ROM game playing Bandai's former president CEO Makoto Yama shina chose d the Macintosh platform over other platforms over that time 24 Around that year Bandai exited the publishing business and dissolved its publishing division with them selling the remaining of its publishing operations Media Works whilst Bandai retained B Club and continued to publish the magazine In early 1994 Bandai approached American technology company Apple with an idea of producing a gaming console later to be called the Apple Pippin known as Pippin mark in Japan partnership with Apple Bandai originally never intended to develop a system with Internet connection however after receiving customer feedback Bandai and Apple established a modem into the Pippin design Once Bandai licensed the Pippin from Apple in December 1994 the former spent US 93 million in marketing alone to sell the Pippin line One year later in June 1995 during the 1995 Tokyo Toy Show Bandai established its unit Bandai Digital Software to promote early Pippin development four months later in October of that year Bandai launched its software publishing division Bandai Digital Entertainment Corporation in order to support the platform and developers in the United States One year later in January 1996 two months before the launch of Apple Pippin console Bandai established Bandai Digital Entertainment Co Ltd was formed on January 9 1996 to support the platform in Japan 24 The Apple Pippin console was released two years later in March 1996 but both the Pippin console and the Play dia were both unsuccessful for Bandai and lead them into discontinuing the console in that year most of the unsold consoles were converted into coin operated Micha King machines by its subsidiary Ban presto 25 In January 1997 Bandai announced it would merge its operations with Japanese video game developer Sega 26 27 28 The merger a 1 billion stock swap where Sega would acquire Bandai and dissolve the company 26 would have established a new entertainment conglomerate named Sega Bandai Ltd with an estimated 6 billion in revenue 29 The announcement followed a 9 billion loss from Bandai the same month attributed to declining game sales and the poor reception of the Apple Pippin console 26 Bandai felt Sega was an appropriate company to merge with as it possessed an American management model and several international offices in addition to owning several successful franchises like Sonic the Hedgehog 26 29 Opposition arose within Bandai's employees and mid level executives as neither felt the company's family friendly work ethic meshed well with Sega's top down corporate culture 30 However following the huge success of Bandai's Tamagotchi toy line and strong opposition from within Bandai caused the plan to fall through However the two companies were not the decisive factors in the deal's collapse and as a result Bandai called off the merge in May before its final iz ation in October 31 President Makoto Yama shina took responsibility for its failure publicly apologizing and resigning his position within the company 32 Even after when Bandai called off the merger talks between Bandai and Sega the former instead agreed to a business alliance with Bandai prior it ising software development for Sega's game consoles 30 One year later on February 27 1998 after the merger between Bandai and Sega had fallen Bandai sold all of the remaining inventory of hardware to American manufacturing company Day Star Digital with Bandai continued to support its own consoles until the end of 2002 33 Later in that year Bandai's American distribution division Bandai America launched its anime entertainment distribution arm called Bandai Entertainment in order to license and distribute anime in North America and originally released its titles on VHS under the Anime Village label before releasing it under its own name In 2002 Bandai released the pre painted kit of a railway car shorty model with a shortened length called the B Train Shorty Similar products similar to the B Train Shorty were released around the same time as the B Train Shorty such as the Star Train a candy toy that realistically models the lead car at the same scale as N gauge and the ZZ Train a battery powered scale model with a rail width smaller than Z gauge In the beginning of March 2003 Bandai announced the merger its subsidiary Yutaka with its garage kit division B Club to form a new subsidiary named Pop y reviving the Pop y brand after its folding with Bandai back in the 1980 s 34 However four years later in 2007 when Bandai's new parent Bandai Namco Holdings announced its restructuring Pop y was folded back into its parent Bandai into its subsidiary Plex whilst retaining the Pop y brand Later in that same month of that year Bandai achieved record high operating and ordinary profits with the launching of the Real Dream Doraemon Project to create a real Doraemon Meanwhile Bandai launched its upgraded version of its handheld game console WonderSwan called the WonderSwan Color was released in 2000 as the successor to the first WonderSwan handheld console enjoyed moderate popularity following the release of the Final Fantasy series for the first time on a handheld game console However a lack of popular software and the onslaught of Nintendo's handheld competitor Game Boy Advance led to a gradual decline and in that same year Bandai announced its de facto withdrawal from handheld game hardware development In April 2004 the company decided moved its headquarters to its current location The new building has four elevators each uniquely equipped with the voice of characters from its franchises and licensed properties such as Mam etchi from the Tamagotchi franchise Kamen Rider No 1 from the Kamen Rider franchise An pan man from the picture book series of the same name and A muro Ray from its anime subsidiary Sunrise Gundam franchise making announcements In September 2005 eight years after the proposed merger of Bandai and Sega had failed Bandai announced that it had merged with multinational video game developer amusement facility entertainment company Namco with whom Bandai had previously had a partnership into establishing a new holding parent company that would bring all of Bandai's toy manufacturing and anime entertainment production activities and Namco's video game publishing developing operations under one group called Bandai Namco Holdings which was called Namco Bandai outside of Japan becoming the largest toy and videogame business 35 After its merger with game developer and amusement facility operator Namco in 2005 Bandai is now under the management and a member of Bandai Namco Holdings Bandai Namco Group One year later on January 4 2006 Bandai's American video game publishing division Bandai Games had merged with Namco's American developing division Namco Home tek to form Namco Bandai Games America Inc which was housed within Bandai Games ' former premises 36 A week later on the 11 th of that month in that year Bandai's console division had been merged with Namco's console game business program mobile phone and research facility divisions to form Namco Bandai Games Inc in March 2006 Both Bandai and Namco continued working independently under the newly formed Bandai Namco Holdings until 31 March 2006 when their video game operations were merged to form Namco Bandai Games 37 On October 30 Bandai's European video game division would merged with Namco's European game division as well forming Namco Bandai Games Europe S A S 38 At the beginning of March 2006 Bandai's hobby building Bandai Hobby Center had been moved from its former factory in Shizuoka Works at Shimizu Ward Shizuoka where the plastic model production had been conducted since the former Imai era to a new factory based in Aoi Ward Shizuoka City and started its operations The new facility handles all Gun pla related areas including development design mold making and production except for sales and promotion By consolidating all aspects of development and production within the same facility Bandai aims to improve production efficiency and quality On April 1 2009 the Bandai Games label website operated by the company was integrated into the official website of Bandai's fellow subsidiary with the Bandai Namco Holdings call Namco Bandai Games At the same time Namco Bandai Games had also taken over the intellectual property rights for game titles released which the games division of Bandai had been previously managed before the integration Furthermore Bandai transferred its commercials for its game titles produced under the Bandai Games label into Namco Bandai Games ' own commercial activities alongside its game business which had been completely integrated into Namco Bandai Games A few weeks later on April 20 of that year Bandai launched its official shopping website called Premium Bandai was launched The site offers a wide variety
