    "transformers_text": "Protesters: ( no centralised authority )\n\nGovernment\n\nOther parties:\n\nProtesters: no centralised leadership BEM SI:\n\nSupported by:\n\nGovernment:\n\nSince February 2025 and as of September 2025 [update] , public and student-led anti-government demonstrations are being held throughout several cities in Indonesia .\n\nThe first wave of protests were launched on 17 February 2025 by the All-Indonesian Students' Union (BEM SI), [ 83 ] together with individual students' unions. [ 84 ] According to the central coordinator of BEM SI, Herianto, the alliance had called for protests all over the country on 17 and 18 February (cancelled at Jakarta), while they would hold the protest centrally at Jakarta on 19 (cancelled) and 20 February. [ 83 ] The Civil Society Coalition had also called for civilians to participate in demonstrations on 21 February following Friday prayers . [ 85 ] [ 86 ] BEM SI projected that around 5,000 students would participate in the protests, [ 87 ] and they also threatened further actions if the government does not react positively. [ 88 ]\n\nThe second wave of protests began in March 2025 following the ratification of the newly revised Indonesian National Armed Forces Law , which increased the number of civilian positions that soldiers are allowed to hold, from 10 to 14. Generally, most of the protests were held in front of the buildings of respective legislatures (national or regional), with its participants usually having worn black clothing, marked by the burning of used tires and clashes with policemen. Protests peaked in February and March 2025, but they began to fade since then.\n\nStarting from Pati Regency , Central Java, a third wave of protests erupted around August 10–13, triggered by a proposed 250% increase in land and building taxes (PBB‑P2). The unrest quickly grew, drawing up to 100,000 protesters, with dozens injured. [ 89 ] On 25 August, thousands, including students, workers, and activists, marched to the national parliament building in Jakarta, protesting against exorbitant allowances for lawmakers. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] After an online motorcycle taxi ( Indonesian : ojek online ) driver was run over by security officers with an armoured vehicle , protesters grew angry. It was the first recorded fatality during the six-month-long protest. [ 11 ] In retaliation, the demonstrators attacked two security officers who were near the location, leaving them lying on the road covered in blood. [ 92 ] After protesters started getting aggressive, the military became involved to protect malls from looting. Protesters torched and looted the House of Representatives members' houses, including that of Ahmad Sahroni .\n\nThe protests occurred as a response over controversial policies by Indonesian president Prabowo Subianto and his vice-president Gibran Rakabuming Raka , which include the free nutritious meal [ id ] (MBG) programme and the enactment of Presidential Instruction Number 1 of 2025 , which led to massive budget cuts, supposedly to fund the free nutritious meal programme. [ 93 ] The nickname #IndonesiaGelap itself originates as a hashtag popular on Twitter (X). According to Beautynesia , the hashtag had been used by more than 760 thousand tweets, [ 94 ] but within 24 hours, this number has increased up to 14 million tweets. [ 95 ] While according to coordinator of BEM SI, Satria Naufal, it represents \"the fears, worries, and well-being of the citizens\". [ 96 ] Digital research company Jangkara found that during February 2025, the hashtag has received 81% negative sentiment, followed by 13% neutral and 6% positive, based on their analysis on 64,816 comments on X. [ 97 ]\n\nThe student protests were preceded by a similar anti-government Adili Jokowi (' Try Jokowi ') protest, which occurred at Surakarta on 14 February 2025, demanding investigation of cases involving him. However, 10 minutes later, the protesters dispersed after heavy rain. [ 98 ] Alongside this, there have been instances of graffiti bearing the inscription Adili Jokowi throughout parts of Java, such as Yogyakarta , Surabaya , and Malang , much of which was later removed by local authorities. [ 99 ] Musician Iwan Fals , nonetheless, has criticised this demand and questioned what are his faults in office. [ 100 ] Meanwhile, founder of KedaiKOPI, Hendri Satrio, has also doubted the success of this movement, stating that it would be difficult for the Prabowo's government to arrest and bring Jokowi into justice. [ 101 ]\n\nCentral coordinator of BEM SI, Herianto, claimed that Indonesia \"is being led by twin suns\", and gave an example regarding ban on sale of 3 kg LPG gas cylinders by small informal retail traders , [ 102 ] a policy that was enforced without knowledge of the president Prabowo Subianto and then subsequently repealed. [ 103 ] He also claimed that students were disappointed after Prabowo shouted \"Long live Jokowi!\" during the 17th anniversary of Gerindra Party at Sentul International Convention Center . Prabowo himself has been accused by his opponents and political analysts of being Jokowi's puppet due to his closeness and the former's president influence on his policies. [ 104 ] Prabowo denied this accusation multiple times, the most recent being during the same 17th anniversary event of Gerindra Party, which he responded to by saying \" Ndasmu! \" (\"Your head!\") with a mocking tone and facial expression. Such reaction attracted criticism from the public as being childish and confrontational towards his opposition. [ 105 ] [ 106 ]\n\nMeanwhile, during protests on 17 February, Prabowo attended a closed meeting together with his ministers of Red and White Cabinet at Istana Merdeka while discussing various strategic issues such as prevention of online gambling . They were also seen having lunch together. [ 107 ] At the same time, all eight fractions of DPR agreed to officially ratify the proposed revision of Mineral and Coal Law in 13th plenary session on 18 February. [ 108 ] [ 109 ] One of the proposed change to the law was to allow universities and colleges across Indonesia to receive mining permits and become involved in mining. Proponents of this change from the government argued that this will lower cost of tertiary education, while academics and students criticized the change as potentially used to silence universities from participating in activism while worsening ecological damage caused by the mining industry. [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] This proposed change was later dropped when the law was passed on 17 February by the parliament the same day the protests erupted. [ 113 ]\n\nIn March 2025, protests began to renew after Indonesian National Armed Forces Law underwent revision by the DPR. The important points of this version, include: [ 114 ] [ 115 ]\n\nOn 19 March, Commission I of DPR and the government agreed to ratify the law next day, [ 117 ] and it officially took effect on 20 March during a plenary session. [ 118 ] [ 119 ] This law caused strong criticism from various parties because it would potentially revive dwifungsi , [ 120 ] leading to an online petition calling for repeal of the revision on Change.org (as of 19 March, it has been signed by more than 26,000 people). [ 121 ] At the same time, the perception of TNI began to deteriorate following a police raid on cockfighting gamble site incident at Way Kanan , Lampung , which led into deaths of three policemen after being shot by two soldiers [ 122 ] [ 123 ] [ 124 ] and a test-drive car theft , which killed a car salesman after being shot by a Navy sailor at North Aceh , both were happened on March 17. [ 125 ]\n\nIn April 2025, protests continue the second wave with #FreePalestine . The hashtag erupt over the Gaza genocide and Prabowo's plan, who said that he was ready to evacuate a thousand Palestinians from Gaza in Indonesia. [ 126 ] [ 127 ] The plan drew the attention of the Majelis Ulama Indonesia (MUI), so that it declared a ban on evacuating victims of the Palestinian conflict in Gaza to Indonesia because it could be interpreted as helping the interests of the Israeli occupation . [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ]\n\nIn addition, the protests erupted over authenticity of Jokowi's undergraduate diploma [ 131 ] after an UGM alumnus, Rismon Hasiholan Sianipar, investigated the authenticity of the diploma. [ 132 ]\n\nThe protests were accompanied by International Workers' Day . [ 133 ]\n\nThe country oversaw new controversial policies imposed by the government. The Indonesian Financial Transaction Reports and Analysis Center (PPATK) temporarily blocked 122 million dormant bank accounts (not being used within at least three months), [ 134 ] based on the evidences of abuse. However, this policy caused much condemnation leading into its reversal. [ 135 ]\n\nAlongside that, a series of anti- transmigration demonstrations were organised by Dayak indigenous communities throughout West Kalimantan , given its potential marginalisation of their lands, resources, and lifestyles. Previously, there were four locations in West Kalimantan that would be designated as destinations for transmigration, [ 136 ] namely Rasau Jaya, Gerbang Mas Perkasa, Sekayam Entikong, and Ketunggau Hulu. [ 137 ] Following this, the transmigration program into West Kalimantan was terminated by the government, [ 138 ] and such protests soon spread into Central Kalimantan [ 139 ] and North Kalimantan in the following month. [ 140 ]\n\nIn early August 2025, some Indonesians raised the Straw Hat Pirates' Jolly Roger flag from the One Piece anime franchise as a symbol of protests. This coincided with the build up to 17 August, when the country celebrated its 80th anniversary of Independence . [ 141 ] This flag was first flown by truck drivers in late July 2025 to protest the administration of Prabowo Subianto . [ 142 ] They also refused to fly any Indonesian flags as a part of the demonstration against the prohibition of ODOL (over dimension, overload) trucks throughout several cities in Java, ongoing since 19 June. [ 143 ]\n\nIn response, the flag was called a threat to the national unity of Indonesia by its government , [ 144 ] especially by the leading figures from People's Consultative Assembly . [ 145 ] The flag has been also declared a symbol of treason and waving the flag is considered as an act of rebellion [ 146 ] and sedition , [ 147 ] while various government institutions attempted to ban this flag. [ 148 ] [ 149 ]\n\nIn August, a number of protests were held in several cities and regencies due to significant increases in property tax by the local governments. Notable protests were held in Pati (250% increase), Bone (300%), and Cirebon (150-1000%). [ 150 ] The protest in Pati on 13 August resulted in a clash between protesters and police, with 33 people injured. [ 151 ]\n\nOn 3 October 2025, the Indonesian government suspended the license of TikTok , the platform's second largest customer base, after the application refused to disclose the data of individuals who live streamed protests. [ 152 ] TikTok's suspension ended after it shared data with the Indonesian government. [ 153 ]\n\nA popular image supporting the student protest is based on the fictional Emergency Alert System (EAS) shown above but with a black background, previously blue. This has led to the bakso P.E.N.T.O.L. movement, a backronym representing six political demands (although the following emerged on 4 February, before the protest):\n\nBEM UI presented these 5 demands during the student protests: [ 154 ]\n\nOn 17 February 2025, during the protests in Jakarta , coordinator Bagas Wisnu read out the following 13 demands to the government. [ 155 ] [ 156 ]\n\nOn 19 February, the original five demands presented by BEM SI have been expanded into the following seven. [ 157 ]\n\nNext day, the demands above were expanded again into nine. [ 158 ]\n\nThe song \"Bayar, Bayar, Bayar\" from punk music duo Sukatani , used as a theme song for the protest, to criticise the Police's performance which is considered unprofessional and full of bribery , extortion , and gratification which happened inside the Police administration in Indonesia. [ 159 ]\n\nA second wave of demonstrations against the Draft Law on the Indonesian National Army (RUU TNI) took place across multiple regions, including Yogyakarta and Jakarta, on 19–20 March 2025. The protests involved students, lecturers, and civil society organizations, who expressed concerns that the bill could undermine democratic principles and civilian supremacy over the military. In Yogyakarta, protesters from the University of Gadjah Mada (UGM) and the Islamic University of Indonesia (UII) presented several key demands: [ 160 ] [ 161 ]\n\nOn 19 March 2025, students from Trisakti University staged a demonstration at Gerbang Pancasila, within the Parliament Complex in Jakarta, opposing the proposed revision of the Indonesian National Army Law (UU TNI). They presented four main demands, expressing concerns that the revisions could weaken civilian supremacy and potentially reintroduce the military's dual function ( dwifungsi TNI) in politics and governance. [ 162 ] The demands were presented to Minister of Law, Supratman Andi Agtas . The key demands of the protest included: [ 163 ] [ 164 ]\n\nOn 7 April 2025, Suara Papua finalise demands of protesters in Indonesia. These are: [ 165 ]\n\nDuring the August 2025 Indonesian protests , public figures and advocates published 25 demands, split into 17 demands to be enacted in one week and 8 demands to be enacted in one year.

They additionally demanded transparency of the use of a special autonomy fund. The head of NasDem Party 's fraction and member of the DPRA third commission, Nurchalis, promised that the students' demands would be discussed at the legislature and carried to the national level. [ 168 ] The protesters left significant rubbish, ranging from used drinking bottles to banners. Since the protesters ignored the requests by journalists to clean the rubbish, it was cleaned by the police. [ 169 ]\n\nIn Medan , students from the State Islamic University of North Sumatra protested front of the building of the North Sumatra Regional House of Representatives (DPRD) on 20 February.

[ 509 ] Former secretary of the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises , Said Didu [ id ] , through his Twitter account, was confused why the #IndonesiaGelap protests focused on toppling down Prabowo, not to bring Jokowi to justice, while according to himself, the condition was caused by Jokowi's faults. [ 510 ] Policy observer Gigin Praginanto, through his Twitter account, satirised that the protests' theme should be better changed from Indonesia Gelap to Indonesia Gelap Banget Nget Nget ('Indonesia Is Very, Very, Very Dark').

[ 521 ] Another mall in Surabaya, Tunjungan Plaza also stopped its operation earlier than usual, on 19:00 WIB due to unrest has reached Tunjungan Street where the mall is located. [ 522 ]\n\nOn 30 April, the United States Government issued a level 2 travel warning to Indonesia citing the possible protest that could turn violent. [ 523 ] On 29 August, the Embassy of the United States, Jakarta issued alert to every American nationals in Indonesia in the wake of protest in front of the Mobile Brigade Corps headquarters in Kwitang which is located close to the U.S. embassy in Jakarta. [ 524 ]\n\nAt the same time, the Taipei Economic and Trade Office in Jakarta issued a warning to all Taiwanese nationals in Indonesia to avoid protest areas. [ 525 ]\n\nThe Canadian Government issued a travel warning to Indonesia in the light of the 28 August protest that turned violent. [ 526 ]\n\nThe British Government updated its travel warning regarding Indonesia on 29 August warning every British nationals in Indonesia to avoid joining protests. [ 527 ]\n\nInternational non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a statement on 19 March condemning the passing of military law amendment for threatening human rights in Indonesia. HRW also urged the parliament to drop the proposed amendment that would enable military to fill the civilian positions in the judiciary and state-owned enterprises. [ 528 ]\n\nAmnesty International via its representative in Indonesia also criticised the passing of the military law. Amnesty International then explained the danger of the military law that have been passed by the parliament and found misconducts within its passing. [ 529 ] Earlier, Amnesty International secretary general Agnès Callamard visited Indonesia to evaluate the human rights situation in Indonesia. [ 530 ]\n\nReporters Without Borders (RSF) through the director of its Asia-Pacific bureau, Cédric Alviani, has also issued condemnation of violence against journalists during Indonesian protests. [ 531 ] Other international NGOs such as the German and Belgian chapters of International Federation of Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture (ACAT), All Arakan Students' & Youths's Congress, Accountability Counsel, and Advocacy Forum-Nepal also published a joint statement condemning the passing of the amendment. [ 532 ]\n\nUnited Nations special rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders Mary Lawlor expressed her concern about repression against the human rights NGOs during the protest and urge Indonesian government to ensure the voice of civic organisations are guaranteed without repression. [ 533 ]\n\nThe US based military newspaper, Stars and Stripes , published a piece on 8 September 2025, argued that demonstrations in Indonesia, while framed as public anger over lawmakers' perks and economic pressures, were being orchestrated by entrenched elites resisting President Prabowo Subianto 's anti-corruption reforms. It contends that the unrest reflects elite pushback against transparency and modernization, rather than grassroots democratic dissent. [ 534 ]\n\nThe student protests were featured as a front cover for the 18 February 2025 online edition of Lentera newspaper. [ 535 ] As of 18 February, the rupiah began to weaken by 0.38% amidst the protests, [ 536 ] however, the currency began to strengthen by 0.10% on 21 February. [ 537 ] In response to the protests, there are currently attempts to counter #IndonesiaGelap on various social media platforms through the hashtag #IndonesiaCerah ('#BrightIndonesia'), originating from an Instagram account benpro.tv. [ 538 ]\n\nAccording to a senior researcher at Citra Institute, Efriza, predicted that then- Minister of Higher Education, Science, and Technology , Satryo Brodjonegoro could be replaced in a reshuffle due to the current student-led protests. [ 539 ] This reshuffle was later confirmed and took effect on 19 February, with Brodjonegoro sacked from the position. [ 540 ] [ 541 ] Rocky Gerung , however, demanded to the government to give the explanation about his sacking, and claimed that the students' movement has been prepared months involving various experts. [ 542 ]\n\nOn 21 March, seven students from the Faculty of Law at the University of Indonesia , submitted a judicial review on the revised Armed Forces Law to the Constitutional Court of Indonesia . They noticed numerous irregularities during its revision, deemed as 'unconstitutional' and 'hurried'. [ 543 ] This move was soon followed by the Civil Society Coalition. [ 544 ]\n\nAs the country situation doesn't show any sign of improvement, many young Indonesians have decided to flee the country to search for a new life as the government keep responding to the protest in bad manners. [ 545 ]\n\nIn March 2025, Indonesia's financial markets faced a severe jolt as the Jakarta Composite Index (JCI) plunged by over 7% in a single trading session. This sharp intraday decline—recorded on 18 March—was the steepest since 2011. The plunge triggered an automatic 30-minute trading halt as markets faced a decline of 6.146% during closure at around 9:37 AM, [ 546 ] a mechanism designed to stabilize markets at 5% during periods of excessive volatility. After a 30-minute halt, trading resumed but the index continued to decline, reaching a 7.1% drop at one point. The sharp decline in Indonesia's stock market quickly rippled across other sectors, with technology and manufacturing companies posting the biggest losses. Shares of DCI Indonesia [ id ] , a leading provider of data center infrastructure, plunged around 20 percent, falling to 115,800 rupiah (approximately $7). Meanwhile, Chandra Asri Pacific [ id ] , a major player in energy and chemicals, saw its stock price drop nearly 19 percent by the afternoon. [ 547 ] During trading, foreign investors made a net sell of IDR 2.48 trillion, continuing the trend of outflows totalling IDR 29.41 trillion since the beginning of the year. Foreign ownership in the JCI also fell to 2.9%, the lowest since 2011, reflecting a decline in global interest in the Indonesian market. This contrasted with other Asian bourses that rallied. [ 548 ] The negative market sentiment was fuelled by concerns over national economic conditions. The sudden downturn reflected a deepening crisis of investor confidence, rooted not only in macroeconomic uncertainties but also in political anxieties and shifting fiscal policies under President Prabowo Subianto's administration. [ 549 ] In February alone, the state budget (APBN) recorded a deficit of IDR 31.2 trillion, while the consumer confidence index and savings ratio fell, indicating weak purchasing power. Layoffs increased, with major factories such as Yamaha and PT Sanken Indonesia [ id ] closing. Tax revenue also weakened, with Income Tax 21 falling 39.5% YoY and IPR declining by 0.5% signalling consumption pressure. There was also a general decline in credit disbursement in Q3 2025 across many provinces, with the slowest growth being SME loans and consumer loans. [ 550 ] [ 551 ] This was attributed to lower consumer purchasing power and confidence as well as unstable political landscape. [ 552 ] During this period, banks began shifting to corporate and commercial loans to avoid the increased risk in consumer and SME loans, where NPLs have experienced the highest increase. This trend occurred despite existing incentives from the Central Bank, such as lowered interest rates, reflecting the credit rationing phenomenon observed during the early days of the reformation era. [ 553 ] Systemic risk looms over the capital market, given the potential impact on the financial sector. [ 548 ]\n\nAlthough macroeconomic factors and controversial fiscal policies of the Prabowo Subianto administration were the main culprits, public discourse and political debates also highlighted the revision of the TNI Law (RUU TNI) as a factor that worsened market sentiment. [ 554 ] According to a Tempo report, economist from CELIOS, Nailul Huda, stated that the decline in the JCI has been occurring since 14 March, and the TNI bill is one of the triggers. He highlighted concerns that the military's expanded role in the civilian and economic spheres could lead to legal uncertainty, erode meritocracy , and cause investor fear. One example is the appointment of an active military officer as President Director of Perum Bulog , which fuelled perceptions of military intervention in the business sector. [ 555 ] [ 556 ] Deputy Chairman of Commission I of the House of Representatives Budi Djiwandono immediately reassured and denied that the TNI Bill was the direct cause of the JCI crash, asserting that there are no articles in the revised draft that explicitly regulate the placement of active TNI officers in state-owned enterprises. [ 557 ] On the other hand, economists such as Wijayanto Samirin cited the revision of the TNI Law as one of the five factors that caused the market crash, citing public concerns over the potential return of ABRI's dual function. This view reflects the market's sensitivity to the issue of militarisation, even if only as a perception. [ 558 ]\n\nThe response from Indonesian authorities was swift but indicative of broader systemic stress. The Financial Services Authority (OJK) introduced temporary measures allowing publicly listed firms to buy back shares without requiring prior shareholder approval—a move aimed at supporting valuations and signaling confidence. Concurrently, Bank Indonesia intervened in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the rupiah, deploying a combination of rate tools and reserves. These interventions did moderate the pace of capital outflows but did little to resolve the underlying concerns surrounding fiscal direction and political stability. [ 559 ]\n\nBy August, the JCI had recovered and broken its previous all-time record. [ 560 ]\n\nAfter the 25–28 August protest turned violent, the Rupiah weakened 0.86% to the U.S. Dollar with a value of IDR 16,455 per U.S. Dollar the following Friday morning. [ 561 ] The incident also caused another Indonesian stock market crash with the IDX Composite experiencing a 2% decline in the Friday morning market session, due to a high amount of panic selling among foreign investors. [ 562 ]\n\nOn 17 June 2025, the Attorney General's Office of Indonesia (Kejagung) revealed during a press conference, a video of Marcella Santoso confessing that she had created numerous negative content surrounding Armed Forces Law, including #IndonesiaGelap protests and a petition calling for its repeal. A day later, she quickly denied her own confession after being interrogated by Kejagung. Marcella herself is an advocate who previously involved in acquittal during a crude palm oil (CPO) corruption scandal, money laundering, and obstruction of justice , the latter of which also involving fellow advocate Junaedi Saibih and the news director of Jak TV , Tian Bahtiar. Director of investigation at Kejagung, Abdul Qohar admitted that the investigators from Solicitor General for Special Crimes (Jampidsus) have not yet entered that issue. [ 563 ]\n\nHead of Information Centre at TNI, Major General Kristomei Sianturi found a number of proofs regarding the funds by Marcella flowing into buzzers , non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and other foundations, amounting up IDR 500 million and US$2 million, while also investigating its actors and their motives. [ 564 ] Executive Director at Amnesty International Indonesia, Usman Hamid [ id ] criticised that the video reveal has no relevance with the ongoing investigation process involving her, while also alleging \"attempts to intimidate students' and civilian movements\".
