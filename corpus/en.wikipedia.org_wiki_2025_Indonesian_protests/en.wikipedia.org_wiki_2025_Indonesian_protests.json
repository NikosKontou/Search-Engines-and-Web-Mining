to search for a new life as the government keep responding to the protest in bad manners 545 In March 2025 Indonesia's financial markets faced a severe jolt as the Jakarta Composite Index JC I plunged by over 7 in a single trading session This sharp intra day decline recorded on 18 March was the steepest since 2011 The plunge triggered an automatic 30 minute trading halt as markets faced a decline of 6 146 during closure at around 9 37 AM 546 a mechanism designed to stabilize markets at 5 during periods of excessive volatility After a 30 minute halt trading resumed but the index continued to decline reaching a 7 1 drop at one point The sharp decline in Indonesia's stock market quickly rippled across other sectors with technology and manufacturing companies posting the biggest losses Shares of DCI Indonesia id a leading provider of data center infrastructure plunged around 20 percent falling to 115 800 rupiah approximately 7 Meanwhile Chandra A sri Pacific id a major player in energy and chemicals saw its stock price drop nearly 19 percent by the afternoon 547 During trading foreign investors made a net sell of IDR 2 48 trillion continuing the trend of out flows totalling IDR 29 41 trillion since the beginning of the year Foreign ownership in the JC I also fell to 2 9 the lowest since 2011 reflecting a decline in global interest in the Indonesian market This contrasted with other Asian bourse s that rallied 548 The negative market sentiment was fuelled by concerns over national economic conditions The sudden downturn reflected a deepening crisis of investor confidence rooted not only in macroeconomic uncertainties but also in political anxieties and shifting fiscal policies under President Pra bow o Sub ianto's administration 549 In February alone the state budget A PB N recorded a deficit of IDR 31 2 trillion while the consumer confidence index and savings ratio fell indicating weak purchasing power Layoffs increased with major factories such as Yamaha and PTS an ken Indonesia id closing Tax revenue also weakened with Income Tax 21 falling 39 5 Yo Y and I PR declining by 0 5 signalling consumption pressure There was also a general decline in credit disbursement in Q 3 2025 across many provinces with the slowest growth being S ME loans and consumer loans 550 551 This was attributed to lower consumer purchasing power and confidence as well as unstable political landscape 552 During this period banks began shifting to corporate and commercial loans to avoid the increased risk in consumer and S ME loans where NP Ls have experienced the highest increase This trend occurred despite existing incentives from the Central Bank such as lowered interest rates reflecting the credit rationing phenomenon observed during the early days of the reformation era 553 Systemic risk looms over the capital market given the potential impact on the financial sector 548 Although macroeconomic factors and controversial fiscal policies of the Pra bow o Sub ianto administration were the main culprits public discourse and political debates also highlighted the revision of the T NI Law RU U T NI as a factor that worsened market sentiment 554 According to a Tempore port economist from CE LIOS Nail ul Huda stated that the decline in the JC I has been occurring since 14 March and the T NI bill is one of the triggers He highlighted concerns that the military's expanded role in the civilian and economic spheres could lead to legal uncertainty erode meritocracy and cause investor fear One example is the appointment of an active military officer as President Director of Peru m Bu log which fuelled perceptions of military intervention in the business sector 555 556 Deputy Chairman of Commission I of the House of Representatives Bud i Dj iwan do no immediately reassured and denied that the T NI Bill was the direct cause of the JC I crash asserting that there are no articles in the revised draft that explicitly regulate the placement of active T NI officers in state owned enterprises 557 On the other hand economists such as Wi jay an to Samir incited the revision of the T NI Law as one of the five factors that caused the market crash citing public concerns over the potential return of A BRI's dual function This view reflects the market's sensitivity to the issue of militar is ation even if only as a perception 558 The response from Indonesian authorities was swift but indicative of broader systemic stress The Financial Services Authority O JK introduced temporary measures allowing publicly listed firms to buy back shares without requiring prior shareholder approval a move aimed at supporting valuations and signaling confidence Concurrently Bank Indonesia intervened in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the rupiah deploying a combination of rate tools and reserves These interventions did moderate the pace of capital out flows but did little to resolve the underlying concerns surrounding fiscal direction and political stability 559 By August the JC I had recovered and broken its previous all time record 560 After the 25 28 August protest turned violent the Rupiah weakened 0 86 to the U S Dollar with a value of IDR 16 455 per U S Dollar the following Friday morning 561 The incident also caused another Indonesian stock market crash with the I DX Composite experiencing a 2 decline in the Friday morning market session due to a high amount of panic selling among foreign investors 562 On 17 June 2025 the Attorney General's Office of Indonesia Ke j agung revealed during a press conference a

found a number of proofs regarding the funds by Marcella flowing into buzzers non governmental organisations NGOs and other foundations amounting up IDR 500 million and US 2 million while also investigating its actors and their motives 564 Executive Director at Amnesty International Indonesia Usman Hamid id criticised that the video reveal has no relevance with the ongoing investigation
