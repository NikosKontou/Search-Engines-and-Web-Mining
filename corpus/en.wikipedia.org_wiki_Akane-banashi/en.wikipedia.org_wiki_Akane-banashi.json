Media has licensed the series for English release in North America An anime television series adaptation produced by Z ex csis set to premiere in 2026 Akane bana shi has received a positive reception from reviewers and has been nominated for various awards Growing up Akane admired her father and his rak ugo a traditional Japanese form of storytelling where a lone performer called arak ugo ka depicts a long complicated and usually funny story involving multiple characters who are distinguished by changes in pitch tone slight turns of the head and hand movements all while sitting in place But when she was in elementary school her father and all the other applicants were expelled from the Arakawa School during the promotional test to obtain rak ugo's third and highest rank of shin ' uchi Six years later Akane who had been secretly receiving lessons from her father's former master sets out to become ashin ' uchi of the Arakawa School to avenge her father and prove rak ugo is a legitimate profession Author Yuki Sue naga stated that Akane bana shi originated with Akane a character he created but did not know what to do with 4 A fan of manzai and conte he was interested in rak ugo but felt it was too difficult to get into Suspecting there were many people who felt the same way and that it would be unexpected of the character he decided to have Akane perform rak ugo Sue naga

by professional rak ugo kaKi kuh i ko Hayashi ya a Hayashi ya had first worked for Shueisha by writing columns analyzing the rak ugo seen in One Piece for One Piece Magazine after they had seen his

including Momo ka Chok a roh and Mi yaji Katsura 6 The serialization of Akane bana shi was proposed in the fall of 2021 6 Artist Takama s a Mou e said when he first heard about the series he found it interesting but worried whether readers of Weekly Sh nen Jump would be interested in rak ugo Realizing it was his job to make them interested he said he tried to get readers emotionally invested in the characters and to broaden the scope to appeal to those unfamiliar with rak ugo 4 Having previously only had a passing interest in rak ugo Mou e said he had fun researching it for Akane bana shi 7 To draw the rak ugo scenes in the manga Mou e listens to a performance of the relevant story and thinks about how to convey the speed and intonation 4 Gen dai Business columnist Kenichiro Horii wrote that Akane bana shi's Arakawa School is clearly modeled after the real life Tate kawa School of rak ugo whose master Dan shi Tate kawa VII expelled a group of zen za in 2002 after feeling that they were not showing enough effort to reach f utatsu me 8 Although Kazuhiro I to of Good Life with Books also noted the similarities he reported that Sue naga stated Is sho Arakawa was instead modeled after En sh S any tei VI j a 9 Horii also pointed out that the Rak ugo Cafe seen in the series is modeled after a real caf with a similar name in J in b ch Tokyo 8 According to Hayashi ya the Yas aka tei and Edo bash i tei theaters in the manga were modeled after Sue hiro tei j a in Shinjuku and the Oe do Nihon bash i tei in Nihon bash i respectively 10 11 For the colored title page of chapter 29

Society 73 Steven Blackburn of Screen Rant praised the first chapter of Akane bana shi He wrote that the sudden shift in protagonists from S hint a a stereotypical hero who embodies everything that makes a successful shonen manga to Akane an unconventional hero who is essentially a wunder kind already makes the latter character compelling That's a difficult dynamic to achieve but Akane bana shi has somehow succeeded before it's even begun 74 In a review for Multi vers it y Comics Zach Wilkerson gave the immensely charming and well crafted first chapter an 8 5 rating with particular praise for Mou e's art 75 Robbie Pleasant of the same website strongly praised the series and its art for successfully conveying how a performer's demeanor and voice changes as they perform different characters despite manga being a static and soundless medium 76 In May 2022 Kota Muk a ihara of Real Sound wrote that Akane bana shi was poised to be a breakout hit He felt that although Akane's progress in rak ugo seemed to be going unusually fast and smooth with her not yet being confronted by a tough challenge or failing at something this allows readers to follow her growth without unnecessary stress Muk a ihara speculated that while this could simply be because the manga was still new and needed to develop quickly in order to gain momentum it emphasizes Akane's cleverness and the depth of her determination and is a testament to the charm of the characters and the skill with which the story is written He also wrote that while Akane's outgoing personality and unprecedented skill make her seem like a maverick her positiv it y and down to earth nature make her a likable character 1 Blackburn's colleague Ben Sock ol praised later chapters of the series for subverting the classic tournament arc trope writing that Akane bana shi feels fresh and different from anything else in Weekly Sh nen Jump and is one of the most exciting manga currently running in the magazine as
