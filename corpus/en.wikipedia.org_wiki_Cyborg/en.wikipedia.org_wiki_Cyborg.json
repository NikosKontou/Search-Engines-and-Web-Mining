    "transformers_text": "A cyborg is a being with both organic and biome cha tronic body parts Pronounced s a b r the name is a portmanteau of cybernetic and organism The term was coined in 1960 by Manfred Clyne s and Nathan S Kline 1 In contrast to bio robots and androids the term cyborg applies to a living organism that has restored function or enhanced abilities due to the integration of some artificial component or technology that relies on feedback 2 Alternative names for a cyborg include cybernetic organism cyber organism cyber organic being cybernetic ally enhanced organism cybernetic ally augmented organism tech n organic being techno organic being and techno organism Unlike bionics bio robotics or androids a cyborg is an organism that has restored function or especially enhanced abilities due to the integration of some artificial component or technology that relies on some sort of feedback for example prostheses artificial organs implants or in some cases wearable technology 3 Cyborg technologies may enable or support collective intelligence 4 A related idea is the augmented human 3 5 6 While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals including humans the term can apply to any organism D S Ha lacy's Cyborg Evolution of the Superman 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a new frontier that was not merely space but more profoundly the relationship between ' inner space ' to ' outer space ' a bridge between mind and matter 7 In A Cyborg Manifesto Donna Hara way rejects the notion of rigid boundaries between humanity and technology arguing that as humans depend on more technology over time humanity and technology have become too interwoven to draw lines between them She believes that since we have allowed and created machines and technology to be so advanced there should be no reason to fear what we have created and cyborgs should be embraced because they are part of human identities 8 However Hara way has also expressed concern over the contradictions of scientific objectivity and the ethics of technological evolution and has argued that There are political consequences to scientific accounts of the world 9 According to some definitions of the term the physical attachments that humans have with even the most basic technologies have already made them cyborgs 10 In a typical example a human with an artificial cardiac pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator would be considered a cyborg since these devices measure voltage potentials in the body perform signal processing and can deliver electrical stimuli using a synthetic feedback mechanism to keep that person alive Implants especially cochlea r implants that combine mechanical modification with any kind of feedback response are also cybernetic enhancements Some theorists who cite such modifications as contact lenses hearing aids smartphones 11 or intraocular lenses as examples of fitting humans with technology to enhance their biological capabilities The emerging trend of implanting microchips inside the body mainly the hands to make financial operations like a contactless payment or basic tasks like opening a door has been erroneously marketed as more recent examples of cybernetic enhancement The latter has not yet seen significant traction outside niche areas in Scandinavia and in actual function is little more than a pre programmed Radio frequency identification RFID microchip encased in glass that does not interact with the human body it is the same technology used in the microchips injected into animals for ease of identification thus not fitting the definition of a cybernetic implant As cyborgs currently are on the rise some theorists who argue there is a need to develop new definitions of aging For instance a bio techno social definition of aging has been suggested 12 The term is also used to address human technology mixtures in the abstract This includes not only commonly used pieces of technology such as phones computers the Internet and so on but also artifacts that are not usually considered technology for example pen and paper and speech and language When augmented with these technologies and connected in communication with people in other times and places a person becomes capable of more than they were before An example is a computer which gains power by using Internet protocols to connect with other computers Another example is a social media bot either a bot assisted human or a human assisted bot used to target social media with likes and shares 13 Cybernetic technologies thus include highways pipes electrical wiring buildings electrical plants libraries and other infra structural constructs Bruce Sterling in his Shape r Mecha nist universe suggested an idea of an alternative cyborg called ' Lobster ' which is made not by using internal implants but by using an external shell e g a powered exoskeleton 14 The computer game Deus Ex Invisible War prominently features cyborgs called Omar Russian for ' lobster ' citation needed In 1994 Hans Has s formulated a scientific view of the human machine hybrids he called hyper cells 15 They can expand their biological cell body with artificial artifacts and thus expand their performance body The theory of hyper cells or Homo proteus as Has s called the human machine hybrid to distinguish Homo sapiens extends Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and deals with the course of evolution beyond humans In his 2019 book Nova cene James Love lock used the term cyborgs to refer to the next generation of beings who will become the understand ers of the future and lead the cosmos to self knowledge While acknowledging the organic component in Clyne s ' and Kline's definition he proposed that these cyborgs will have designed and built themselves from the artificial intelligence systems we have already constructed and used the term cyborg to emphasize that the new intelligent beings will have arisen like us from Darwinian evolution 16 The concept of a man machine mixture was widespread in science fiction before World War II As early as 1843 Edgar Allan Poe described a man with extensive prostheses in the short story The Man That Was Used Up In 1911 Jean de La Hire introduced the Nyc ta lope a science fiction hero who was perhaps the first literary cyborg in Le Myst re des XV later translated as The Nyc ta lope on Mars 17 18 19 Nearly two decades later Edmond Hamilton presented space explorers with a mixture of organic and machine parts in his 1928 novel The Comet Doom He later featured the talking living brain of an old scientist Simon Wright floating in a transparent case and in all the adventures of his famous hero Captain Future In 1944 in the short story No Woman Born C L Moore wrote of Deir dre a dancer whose body was burned completely and whose brain was placed in a faceless but beautiful and supple mechanical body In 1960 the term cyborg was coined by Manfred E Clyne s and Nathan S Kline to refer to their conception of an enhanced human being who could survive in extraterrestrial environments 1 For the exogenous ly extended organizational complex functioning as an integrated homeostatic system unconsciously we propose the term ' Cyborg ' Their concept was the outcome of thinking about the need for an intimate relationship between human and machine as the new frontier of space exploration was beginning to develop A designer of physiological instrumentation and electronic data processing systems Clyne s was the chief research scientist in the Dynamic Simulation Laboratory at Rockland State Hospital in New York The term first appears in print 5 months earlier when The New York Times reported on the Psycho physiological Aspects of Space Flight Symposium where Clyne s and Kline first presented their paper A cyborg is essentially a man machine system in which the control mechanisms of the human portion are modified externally by drugs or regulatory devices so that the being can live in an environment different from the normal one 20 Thereafter Hamilton would first use the term cyborg explicitly in the 1962 short story After a Judgment Day to describe the mechanical analogs called Charlie s explaining that c y borg s they had been called from the first one in the 1960 s cybernetic organisms In 2001 a book titled Cyborg Digital Destiny and Human Possibility in the Age of the Wearable computer was published by Doubleday 21 Some of the ideas in the book were incorporated into the documentary film Cyberman that same year Cyborg tissues structured with carbon nanotubes and plant or fungal cells have been used in artificial tissue engineering to produce new materials for mechanical and electrical uses Such work was presented by Raffaele Di Giacomo Bruno Mares ca and others at the Materials Research Society's spring conference on 3 April 2013 22 The cyborg obtained was inexpensive light and had unique mechanical properties It could also be shaped in the desired forms Cells combined with multi walled carbon nanotubes MW CNT s co precipitated as a specific aggregate of cells and nanotubes that formed a viscous material Likewise dried cells still acted as as table matrix for the MW CNT network When observed by optical microscopy the material resembled an artificial tissue composed of highly packed cells The effect of cell drying was manifested by their ghost cell appearance A rather specific physical interaction between MW CNT s and cells was observed by electron microscopy suggesting that the cell wall the outermost part of fungal and plant cells may play a major active role in establishing a carbon nanotube's network and its stabilization This novel material can be used in a wide range of electronic applications from heating to sensing For instance using Candida albicans cells a species of yeast that often lives inside the human gastrointestinal tract cyborg tissue materials with temperature sensing properties have been reported 23 In current prosthetic applications the C Leg system developed by Otto Bock HealthCare is used to replace a human leg that has been amputated because of injury or illness The use of sensors in the artificial C Leg aids in walking significantly by attempting to replicate the user's natural gait as it would be prior to amputation 24 A similar system is being developed by the Swedish orthopedic company In te g rum the OPR A Implant System which is surgically anchored and integrated by means of os seo integration into the skeleton of the remainder of the amputated limb 25 The same company has developed e OPR A a will powered upper limb prosthesis system that is being evaluated in a clinical trial to allow sensory input to the central nervous system using pressure and temperature sensors in the prosthesis ' finger tips 26 27 Prostheses like the C Leg the e OPR A Implant System and the i Limb are considered by some to be the first real steps towards the next generation of real world cyborg applications citation needed Additionally cochlea r implants and magnetic implants which provide people with a sense that they would not otherwise have had can additionally be thought of as creating cyborgs citation needed In vision science direct brain implants have been used to treat non congenital acquired blindness One of the first scientists to come up with a working brain interface to restore sight was private researcher William Do belle Do belle's first prototype was implanted into Jerry a man blinded in adulthood in 1978 A single array BCI containing 68 electrodes was implanted on to Jerry's visual cortex and succeeded in producing ph os phe nes the sensation of seeing light The system included cameras mounted on glasses to send signals to the implant Initially the implant allowed Jerry to see shades of grey in a limited field of vision at a low frame rate This also required him to be hooked up to a two ton mainframe but shrinking electronics and faster computers made his artificial eye more portable and now enable him to perform simple tasks unassisted 28 In 1997 Philip Kennedy a scientist and physician created the world's first human cyborg from Johnny Ray a Vietnam War veteran who suffered a stroke Ray's body as doctors called it was locked in Ray wanted his old life back so he agreed to Kennedy's experiment Kennedy embedded an implant he designed and named a neuro troph ic electrode near the injured part of Ray's brain so that Ray would be able to have some movement back in his body The surgery went successfully but in 2002 Ray died 29 In 2002 Canadian Jens Naumann also blinded in adulthood became the first in a series of 16 paying patients to receive Do belle's second generation implant marking one of the earliest commercial uses of BC Is The second generation device used a more sophisticated implant enabling better mapping of ph os phe nes into coherent vision Ph os phe nes are spread out across the visual field in what researchers call the starry night effect Immediately after his implant Naumann was able to use his imperfectly restored vision to drive slowly around the parking area of the research institute 30 In contrast to replacement technologies in 2002 under the heading Project Cyborg a British scientist Kevin Warwick had an array of 100 electrodes fired into his nervous system to link his nervous system into the internet to investigate enhancement possibilities With this in place Warwick successfully carried out a series of experiments including extending his nervous system over the internet to control a robotic hand also receiving feedback from the fingertips to control the hand's grip This was a form of extended sensory input Subsequently he investigated ultrasonic input to remotely detect the distance to objects Finally with electrodes also implanted into his wife's nervous system they conducted the first direct electronic communication experiment between the nervous systems of two humans 31 32 Since 2004 British artist Neil Harb is son has had a cyborg antenna implanted in his head that allows him to extend his perception of colors beyond the human visual spectrum through vibrations in his skull 33 His antenna was included within his 2004 passport photograph which has been said to confirm his cyborg status 34 In 2012 at TED Global 35 Harb is son explained that he started to feel like a cyborg when he noticed that the software and his brain had united and given him an extra sense 35 Harb is son is a co founder of the Cyborg Foundation 2004 36 and co founded the Tr an species Society in 2017 which is an association that empowers individuals with non human identities and supports them in their decisions to develop unique senses and new organs 37 Neil Harb is son is a global advocate for the rights of cyborgs Rob Spence a Toronto based filmmaker who titles himself a real life Eyeborg severely damaged his right eye in a shooting accident on his grandfather's farm as a child 38 Many years later in 2005 he decided to have his ever deteriorating and now technically blind eye surgically removed 39 where after he wore an eye patch for some time before he later after having played for some time with the idea of installing a camera instead contacted professor Steve Mann at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology an expert in wearable computing and cyborg technology 39 Under Mann's guidance Spence at age 36 created a prototype in the form of the miniature camera which could be fitted inside his prosthetic eye an invention that would come to be named by Time magazine as one of the best inventions of 2009 The bionic eye records everything he sees and contains a 1 5 mm 2 low resolution video camera a small round printed circuit board a wireless video transmitter which allows him to transmit what he is seeing in real time to a computer and a 3 volt rechargeable VARTA micro battery The eye is not connected to his brain and has not restored his sense of vision Additionally Spence has also installed a laser like LED light in one version of the prototype 40 Furthermore many people with multi functional radio frequency identification RFID microchips injected into a hand are known to exist With the chips they are able to swipe cards open or unlock doors operate devices such as printers or with some using crypto currency buy products such as drinks with a wave of the hand 41 42 43 44 45 body NET is an application of human electronic interaction currently when in development by researchers from Stanford University 46 The technology is based on stretch able semiconductor materials El as tronic According to their article in Nature the technology is composed of smart devices screens and a network of sensors that can be implanted into the body woven into the skin or worn as clothes It has been suggested that this platform can potentially replace the smartphone in the future 47 In medicine there are two important and different types of cyborgs the restorative and the enhanced Restorative technologies restore lost function organs and limbs 48 The key aspect of restorative cyborg iz ation is the repair of broken or missing processes to revert to a healthy or average level of function There is no enhancement to the original faculties and processes that were lost On the contrary the enhanced cyborg follows a principle and it is the principle of optimal performance maxim ising output the information or modifications obtained and minim ising input the energy expended in the process 49 Thus the enhanced cyborg intends to exceed normal processes or even gain new functions that were not originally present Although prostheses in general supplement lost or damaged body parts with the integration of a mechanical artifice bionic implants in medicine allow model organs or body parts to mimic the original function more closely Michael Choros t wrote a memoir of his experience with cochlea r implants or bionic ears titled Rebuilt How Becoming Part Computer Made Me More Human 50 Jesse Sullivan became one of the first people to operate a fully robotic limb through a nerve muscle graft enabling him a complex range of motions beyond that of previous prosthetics 51 By 2004 a fully functioning artificial heart was developed 52 The continued technological development of bionic and bio nano technologies begins to raise the question of enhancement and of the future possibilities for cyborgs which surpass the original functionality of the biological model The ethics and desirability of enhancement prosthetics have been debated their proponents include the trans humanist movement with its belief that new technologies can assist the human race in developing beyond its present normative limitations such as aging and disease as well as other more general inabilities such as limitations on speed strength endurance and intelligence Opponents of the concept describe what they believe to be biases which propel the development and acceptance of such technologies namely a bias towards functionality and efficiency that may compel assent to a view of human people which de emphasizes as defining characteristics actual manifestations of humanity and person hood in favor of definition in terms of upgrades versions and utility 53 54 Retinal implants are another form of cyborg iz ation in medicine The theory behind retinal stimulation to restore vision for those suffering from ret in it is pigment osa and vision loss due to aging conditions in which people have an abnormally low number of retinal ganglion cells is that the retinal implant and electrical stimulation would act as a substitute for the missing ganglion cells cells which connect the eye to the brain While the work to perfect this technology is still being done there have already been major advances in the use of electronic stimulation of the retina to allow the eye to sense patterns of light A specialized camera is worn by the subject such as on the frames of their glasses which converts the image into a pattern of electrical stimulation A chip located in the user's eye would then electrically stimulate the retina with this pattern by exciting certain nerve endings which transmit the image to the optic centers of the brain and the image would then appear to the user If technological advances proceed as planned this technology may be used by thousands of blind people and restore vision to most of them A similar process has been created to aid people who have lost their vocal cords This experimental device would do away with previously used robotic sounding voice simulators The transmission of sound would start with a surgery to redirect the nerve that controls the voice and sound production to a muscle in the neck where a nearby sensor would be able to pick up its electrical signals The signals would then move to a processor which would control the timing and pitch of a voice simulator That simulator would then vibrate producing a multi tonal sound that could be shaped into words by the mouth 55 An article published in Nature Materials in 2012 reported research on cyborg tissues engineered human tissues with embedded three dimensional mesh of nano scale wires with possible medical implications 56 In 2014 researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign and Washington University in St Louis had developed a device that could keep a heart beating endlessly By using 3 D printing and computer modeling these scientists developed an electronic membrane that could successfully replace pacemakers The device uses a spider web like network of sensors and electrodes to monitor and maintain a normal heart rate with electrical stimuli Unlike traditional pacemakers that are similar from patient to patient the elastic heart glove is made custom by using high resolution imaging technology The first prototype was created to fit a rabbit's heart operating the organ in an oxygen and nutrient rich solution The stretch able material and circuits of the apparatus were first constructed by Professor John A Rogers in which the electrodes are arranged in an s shape design to allow them to expand and bend without breaking Although the device is only currently used as a research tool to study changes in heart rate in the future the membrane may serve as a safeguard against heart attacks 57 A brain computer interface or BCI provides a direct path of communication from the brain to an external device effectively creating a cyborg Research into invasive BC Is which use electrodes implanted directly into the grey matter of the brain has focused on restoring damaged eyesight in the blind and providing functionality to paralyzed people most notably those with severe cases such as locked in syndrome This technology could enable people who are missing a limb or are in a wheelchair the power to control the devices that aid them through neural signals sent from the brain implants directly to computers or the devices It is possible that this technology will also eventually be used with healthy people 58 Deep brain stimulation is a neurological surgical procedure used for therapeutic purposes This process has aided in treating patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease Tourette syndrome epilepsy chronic headaches and mental disorders After the patient is unconscious through anesthesia brain pacemakers or electrodes are implanted into the region of the brain where the cause of the disease is present The region of the brain is then stimulated by bursts of electric current to disrupt the oncoming surge of seizures Like all invasive procedures deep brain stimulation may put the patient at a higher risk However there have been more improvements in recent years with deep brain stimulation than any available drug treatment 59 Automated insulin delivery systems colloquially also known as the artificial pancreas are a substitute for the lack of natural insulin production by the body most notably in Type 1 Diabetes Currently available systems combine a continuous glucose monitor with an insulin pump that can be remote controlled forming a control loop that automatically adjusts the insulin dosage depending on the current blood glucose level Examples of commercial systems that implement such a control loop are the MiniMe d 670 G from Med tronic 60 and the t slim x 2 from Tandem Diabetes Care 61 Do it yourself artificial pancreas technologies also exist though these are not verified or approved by any regulatory agency 62 Upcoming next generation artificial pancreas technologies include automatic glucagon infusion in addition to insulin to help prevent hypoglycemia and improve efficiency One example of such a bi hormonal system is the Beta Bionics i Let 63 Military organizations ' research has recently focused on the use of cyborg animals for the purposes of a supposed tactical advantage DARPA has announced its interest in developing cyborg insects to transmit data from sensors implanted into the insect during the pupa stage The insect's motion would be controlled from a micro electromechanical system MEM S and could conceivably survey an environment or detect explosives and gas 64 Similarly DARPA is developing a neural implant to remotely control the movement of sharks The shark's unique senses would then be exploited to provide data feedback in relation to enemy ship movement or underwater explosives 65 In 2006 researchers at Cornell University invented 66 a new surgical procedure to implant artificial structures into insects during their metamorphic development 67 68 The first insect cyborgs moths with integrated electronics in their thorax were demonstrated by the same researchers 69 70 The initial success of the techniques has resulted in increased research and the creation of a program called Hybrid Insect MEM S HI MEM S Its goal according to DARPA's Microsystems Technology Office is to develop tightly coupled machine insect interfaces by placing micro mechanical systems inside the insects during the early stages of metamorphosis 71 The use of neural implants has recently been attempted with success on cockroaches Surgically applied electrodes were put on the insect which was remotely controlled by a human The results although sometimes different basically showed that the cockroach could be controlled by the impulses it received through the electrodes DARPA is now funding this research because of its obvious beneficial applications to the military and other areas 72 In 2009 at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE MEM S conference in Italy researchers demonstrated the first wireless flying beetle cyborg 73 Engineers at the University of California Berkeley have pioneered the design of a remote controlled beetle funded by the DARPA HI MEM S Program 74 This was followed later that year by the demonstration of wireless control of a lift assisted moth cyborg 75 Eventually researchers plan to develop HI MEM S for dragonflies bees rats and pigeons 76 77 For the HI MEM S cybernetic bug to be considered a success it must fly 100 metres 330 ft from a starting point guided via computer into a controlled landing within 5 metres 16 ft of a specific end point Once landed the cybernetic bug must remain in place 76 In 2020 an article published in Science Robotics 78 by researchers at the University of Washington reported a mechanically steerable wireless camera attached to beetles 79 Miniature cameras weighing 248 mg were attached to live beetles of the Ten e brion id genera As bolus an dEleo des The camera wirelessly streamed video to a smartphone via Bluetooth for up to 6 hours and the user could remotely steer the camera to achieve a bug's eye view 80 In 2016 Cy b athlon became the first cyborg ' Olympics ' celebrated in Zurich Switzerland it was the first worldwide and official celebration of cyborg sports In this event 16 teams of people with disabilities used technological developments to turn themselves into cyborg athletes There were 6 different events and its competitors used and controlled advanced technologies such as powered prosthetic legs and arms robotic exoskeletons bikes and motorized wheelchairs 81 This was already a remarkable improvement as it allowed disabled people to compete and showed the several technological enhancements that are already making a difference however it showed that there is still a long way to go For instance the exoskeleton race still required its participants to stand up from a chair and s it down navigate a slalom and other simple activities such as walking over stepping stones and climbing up and down stairs Despite the simplicity of these activities 8 of the 16 teams that participated in the event drop off before the start 82 Nonetheless one of the main goals of this event and such simple activities is to show how technological enhancements and advanced prosthetics can make a difference in people's lives The next Cy b athlon that was expected to occur in 2020 was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic The concept of the cyborg is often associated with science fiction However many artists have incorporated and re appropriated the idea of cybernetic organisms into their work using disparate aesthetics and often realising actual cyborg constructs their works range from performances to paintings and installations Some of the pioneering artists who created such works are H R G iger S tel arc Orl an Shu Lea Che ang Lee Bul Tim Hawkins on Steve Mann Patricia Pic c in in i More recently this type of artistic practice has been expanded upon by artists such as Marco Donna rum ma Waf a a Bilal Neil Harb is son Moon Ribas Man el De A guas and Quim era Rosa S tel arc is a performance artist who has visually probed and acoustically amplified his body He uses medical instruments prosthetics robotics virtual reality systems the Internet and biotechnology to explore alternate intimate and involuntary interfaces with the body He has made three films of the inside of his body and has performed with a third hand and a virtual arm Between 1976 and 1988 he completed 25 body suspension performances with hooks into the skin For ' Third Ear ' he surgically constructed an extra ear within his arm that was internet enabled making it a publicly accessible acoustical organ for people in other places 83 He is presently performing as his avatar from his second life site 84 Tim Hawkins on promotes the idea that bodies and machines are coming together as one where human features are combined with technology to create the Cyborg Hawkins on's piece Emote r presented how society is now dependent on technology 85 Marco Donna rum ma is a performance artist and new media artist In his work the body becomes a morphin g language to speak critically of ritual power and technology For his 7 Configurations cycle between 2014 and 2019 he engineered and created six A I prostheses each embodying an uncanny configuration of the machi nic with the organic 86 The prostheses designed together with a team of artists and scientists are useless prostheses paradoxical objects designed for the body but not to enhance it rather to subtract functions from it a skin cutting robot with a steel metal knife a facial prosthesis which blocks the wearer's gaze with a mechanical arm and two robotic spines that function as additional limbs without a body The prostheses have been created to act as performers with their own agency that is to interact with their human partners without being controlled externally The machines are embedded with biomimetic neural networks information processing algorithms inspired by the biological nervous system of mammals Developed by Donna rum ma in collaboration with the Neuro robotics Research Laboratory DE these neural networks endow the machines with artificial cognitive and sensor i motor skills 87 Waf a a Bilal is an Iraqi American performance artist who had a small 10 megapixel digital camera surgically implanted into the back of his head part of a project entitled 3 rd I 88 For one year beginning 15 December 2010 an image was captured once per minute 24 hours a day and streamed live to www 3 rdi me and the Math af Arab Museum of Modern Art The site also displays Bilal's location via GPS Bilal says that the reason why he put the camera in the back of the head was to make an allegorical statement about the things we don't see and leave behind 89 As a professor at NYU this project raised privacy issues and so Bilal was asked to ensure that his camera did not take photographs in NYU buildings 89 Machines are becoming more ubiquitous in the artistic process itself with computerized drawing pads replacing pen and paper and drum machines becoming nearly as popular as human drummers Composers such as Brian Eno have developed and used software that can build entire musical scores from a few basic mathematical parameters 90 Scott Drave s is a generative artist whose work is explicitly described as a cyborg mind His Electric Sheep project generates abstract art by combining the work of many computers and people over the internet 91 Artists have explored the term cyborg from a perspective involving imagination Some work to make an abstract idea of technological and human bodily union apparent to reality in an art form using varying mediums from sculptures and drawings to digital renderings Artists who seek to make cyborg based fantasies a reality often call themselves cyborg artists or may consider their artwork cyborg How an artist or their work may be considered cyborg will vary depending upon the interpreter's flexibility with the term Scholars that rely upon a strict technical description of a cyborg often going by Norbert Wiener's cybernetic theory and Manfred E Clyne s and Nathan S Kline's first use of the term would likely argue that most cyborg artists do not qualify to be considered cyborgs 92 Scholars considering a more flexible description of cyborgs may argue it incorporates more than cybernetics 93 Others may speak of defining subcategories or specialized cyborg types that qualify different levels of cyborg at which technology influences an individual This may range from technological instruments being external temporary and removable to being fully integrated and permanent 94 Nonetheless cyborg artists are artists Being so it can be expected for them to incorporate the cyborg idea rather than a strict technical representation of the term 95 seeing how their work will sometimes revolve around other purposes outside of cyborg is m 92 As medical technology becomes more advanced some techniques and innovations are adopted by the body modification community While not yet cyborgs in the strict definition of Manfred Clyne s and Nathan Kline technological developments like implantable silicon silk electronics 96 augmented reality 97 and QR codes 98 are bridging the disconnect between technology and the body Hypothetical technologies such as digital tattoo interfaces 99 100 would blend body modification aesthetics with interactivity and functionality bringing a trans humanist way of life into present day reality In addition it is quite plausible for anxiety expression to manifest Individuals may experience pre implantation feelings of fear and nervousness To this end individuals may also embody feelings of uneasiness particularly in a socialized setting due to their post operative technologically augmented bodies and mutual unfamiliarity with the mechanical insertion Anxieties may be linked to notions of other ness or a cyborg ed identity 101 Sending humans to space is a dangerous task in which the implementation of various cyborg technologies could be used in the future for risk mitigation 102 Stephen Hawking a renowned physicist stated Life on Earth is at the ever increasing risk of being wiped out by a disaster such as sudden global warming nuclear war I think the human race has no future if it doesn't go into space The difficulties associated with space travel could mean it might be centuries before humans ever become a multi planet species citation needed There are many effects of spaceflight on the human body One major issue of space exploration is the biological need for oxygen If this necessity was taken out of the equation space exploration would be revolutionized A theory proposed by Manfred E Clyne s and Nathan S Kline is aimed at tackling this problem The two scientists theorized that the use of an inverse fuel cell that is capable of reducing CO 2 to its components with the removal of the carbon and re circulation of the oxygen 103 could make breathing unnecessary Another prominent issue is radiation exposure Yearly the average human on earth is exposed to approximately 0 30 rem of radiation while an astronaut aboard the International Space Station for 90 days is exposed to 9 rem 104 To tackle the issue Clyne s and Kline theorized a cyborg containing a sensor that would detect radiation levels and a Rose osmotic pump which would automatically inject protective pharmaceuticals in appropriate doses Experiments injecting these protective pharmaceuticals into monkeys have shown positive results in increasing radiation resistance 103 Although the effects of spaceflight on our bodies are an important issue the advancement of propulsion technology is just as important With our current technology it would take us about 260 days to get to Mars 105 A study backed by NASA proposes an interesting way to tackle this issue through deep sleep or torpor With this technique it would reduce astronauts ' metabolic functions with existing medical procedures 106 So far experiments have only resulted in patients being in torpor state for one week Advancements to allow for longer states of deep sleep would lower the cost of the trip to Mars as a result of reduced astronaut resource consumption Theorists such a sAndy Clark suggest that interactions between humans and technology result in the creation of a cyborg system In this model cyborg is defined as a part biological part mechanical system that results in the augmentation of the biological component and the creation of a more complex whole Clark argues that this broadened definition is necessary to an understanding of human cognition He suggests that any tool which is used to offload part of a cognitive process may be considered the mechanical component of a cyborg system Examples of this human and technology cyborg system can be very low tech and simplistic such as using a calculator to perform basic mathematical operations or pen and paper to make notes or as high tech as using a personal computer or phone According to Clark these interactions between a person and a form of technology integrate that technology into the cognitive process in a way that is analogous to the way that a technology that would fit the traditional concept of cyborg augmentation becomes integrated with its biological host Because all humans in some way use technology to augment their cognitive processes Clark comes to the conclusion that we are natural born cyborgs 107 Professor Donna Hara way also theorizes that people metaphorically or literally have been cyborgs since the late twentieth century If one considers the mind and body as one much of humanity is aided with technology in almost every way which hybridizes humans with technology 108 Given the technical scope of current and future implantable sensory tele metric devices such devices will be greatly proliferated and will have connections to commercial medical and governmental networks For example in the medical sector patients will be able to log in to their home computer and thus visit virtual doctor's offices medical databases and receive medical prognoses from the comfort of their own home from the data collected through their implanted tele metric devices 109 However this online network presents large security concerns because it has been proven by several U S universities that hackers could get on to these networks and shut down peoples ' electronic prosthetics 109 Cyborg data mining refers to the collection of data produced by implantable devices These sorts of technologies are already present in the U S workforce as a firm in River Falls Wisconsin called Three Square Market partnered with a Swedish firm Bio hacks Technology to implant RFID microchips which are about the size of a grain of rice in the hands of its employees that allow employees to access offices computers and even vending machines More than 50 of the firm's 85 employees were chipped It was confirmed that the American Food and Drug Administration approved of these implantation s 110 If these devices are to be proliferated within society then the question that begs to be answered is what regulatory agency will oversee the operations monitoring and security of these devices According to this case study of Three Square Market it seems that the FDA is assuming a role in regulating and monitoring these devices It has been argued that a new regulatory framework needs to be developed so that the law keeps up with developments in implantable technologies 111 In 2010 the Cyborg Foundation became the world's first international organization dedicated to help humans become cyborgs 112 The foundation was created by cyborg Neil Harb is son and Moon Ribas as a response to the growing number of letters and emails received from people around the world interested in becoming cyborgs 113 The foundation's main aims are to extend human senses and abilities by creating and applying cybernetic extensions to the body 114 to promote the use of cybernetics in cultural events and to defend cyborg rights 115 In 2010 the foundation based in Mata r Barcelona was the overall winner of the C re tic Awards organized by Tec no campus Mata r 116 In 2012 Spanish film director Rafe l Duran Torrent created a short film about the Cyborg Foundation In 2013 the film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival's Focus Forward Filmmakers Competition and was awarded US 100 000 117 Cyborgs are a recurring feature of science fiction literature and other media 118 119 The US based company Backyard Brains released what they refer to as the world's first commercially available cyborg called the Rob o Roach The project started as a senior design project for a University of Michigan biomedical engineering student in 2010 121 and was launched as an available beta product on 25 February 2011 122 The Rob o Roach was officially released into production via a TED talk at the TED Global conference 123 and via the crowd funding website Kickstart erin 2013 124 the kit allows students to use micro stimulation to momentarily control the movements of a walking cockroach left and right using a Bluetooth enabled smartphone as the controller Other groups have developed cyborg insects including researchers at North Carolina State University 125 126 UC Berkeley 127 128 and Nanyang Technological University Singapore 129 130 131 132 133 but the Rob o Roach was the first kit available to the general public and was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health as a device to serve as a teaching aid to promote an interest in neuroscience 123 Several animal welfare organizations including the RSPCA 134 and PETA 135 have expressed concerns about the ethics and welfare of animals in this project In 2022 remote controlled cyborg cockroaches functional if moving or moved to sunlight for recharging were presented They could be used e g for purposes of inspecting hazardous areas or quickly finding humans underneath hard to access rubble s at disaster sites 136 137 120 138 In the late 2010 s scientists created cyborg jellyfish using a micro electronic prosthetic that propels the animal to swim almost three times faster while using just twice the metabolic energy of their unmodified peers The prosthetics can be removed without harming the jellyfish 139 140 A combination of synthetic biology nanotechnology and materials science approaches have been used to create a few different iterations of bacterial cyborg cells 141 142 143 These different types of mechanically enhanced bacteria are created with so called bionic manufacturing principles that combine natural cells with abiotic materials In 2005 researchers from the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Nebraska Lincoln created a super sensitive humidity sensor by coating the bacteria Bacillus ce reus with gold nanoparticles being the first to use a microorganism to make an electronic device and presumably the first cyborg bacteria or cell borg circuit 144 Researchers from the Department of Chemistry at the University of California Berkeley published a series of articles in 2016 describing the development of cyborg bacteria capable to harvest sunlight more efficiently than plants 145 In the first study the researchers induced the self photo sensitization of a non photosynthetic bacterium Moor ella thermo acetic a with cadmium sulfide nanoparticles enabling the photosynthesis of acetic acid from carbon dioxide 146 A follow up article described the elucidation of the mechanism of semiconductor to bacterium electron transfer that allows the transformation of carbon dioxide and sunlight into acetic acid 147 Scientists of the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of California Davis and Academia Sinica in Taiwan developed a different approach to create cyborg cells by assembling a synthetic hydro gel inside the bacterial cytoplasm of Escherichia coli cells rendering them incapable of dividing and making them resistant to environmental factors antibiotics and high oxidative stress 148 The intracellular infusion of synthetic hydro gel provides these cyborg cells with an artificial cytoskeleton and their acquired tolerance makes them well placed to become a new class of drug delivery systems positioned between classical synthetic materials and cell based systems Reference entries",
