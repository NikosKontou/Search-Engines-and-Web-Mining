Yuko Yamaguchi and owned by the Japanese company Sanrio 7 8 9 Sanrio depicts Hello Kitty as a British anthropomorphized white cat with a red bow and no visible mouth 10 11 According to her backstory she lives in a London suburb with her family and is close to her twin sister Mim my who is depicted with a yellow bow 6 12 Hello Kitty was created in 1974 and the first item a vinyl coin purse was introduced in 1975 13 14 Originally Hello Kitty was only marketed towards pre teenage girls but beginning in the 1990 s the brand found commercial success among teenage and adult consumers as well 15 Hello Kitty's popularity also grew with the emergence of kawai i cute culture 16 The brand went into decline in Japan after the 1990 s but continued to grow in the international market 17 By 2010 the character was worth 5 billion a year and The New York Times called her a global marketing phenomenon 17 She did about 8 billion at retail in 2013 18 UNICEF has appointed Hello Kitty children's ambassador and the Japanese government appointed her ambassador of tourism 15 There are Sanrio theme parks based on Hello Kitty Harmony land in Hi ji it a Japan 19 Sanrio Puroland in Tama New Town Tokyo Japan and Hello Kitty Shanghai Times in Shanghai China 20 The Hello Kitty media franchise has grown to include a number of animated series targeted towards children as well as several comics animated films video games books music albums and other media productions A variety of products have featured the character over the years like school supplies clothing accessories and toys along with other items In 2008 there were over 50 000 different Hello Kitty branded products 15 In 1962 Shintaro Tsuji founder of Sanrio began selling rubber sandals with flowers painted on them 21 Tsuji noted the profits gained by adding a cute design to the shoes and hired cartoonists to design cute characters for his merchandise 21 Hello Kitty was designed by Yuko Shimizu and was added to the lineup of early Sanrio characters in 1974 8 Hello Kitty was initially known only as the white kitten with no name 11 Shimizu got the name Kitty from Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass during a scene early in the book Alice plays with a cat she calls Kitty 22 Sanrio's motto is social communication and Tsuji wanted the brand name to reflect that by including a greeting He first considered Hi Kitty before finally settling on Hello Kitty her current name 23 Sanrio decided to make Hello Kitty British because foreign countries in particular Britain were trendy in Japan at the time of Hello Kitty's creation Sanrio already had several characters set in the US and it wanted Hello Kitty to be different 9 15 In 1976 Sets uk o Yone kubo temporarily took over as lead designer for Hello Kitty after Shimizu left Sanrio In 1980 Yuko Yamaguchi became lead designer and has remained in charge since 24 Yamaguchi has said that fashion movies and TV inspire her in creating new designs New series involving Hello Kitty with different themed designs are released regularly following current trends 9 17 Spokespeople for Sanrio have said that Hello Kitty has no mouth as they want people to project their feelings on to the character and be happy or sad together with Hello Kitty 9 25 Another explanation Sanrio has given for Hello Kitty's lack of a mouth is that she speaks from the heart She's Sanrio's ambassador to the world and isn't bound to any particular language 15 However Yuko Yamaguchi has also said that Kitty has a mouth that is hidden in the fur 26 Representatives for Sanrio have said that they see Hello Kitty as a symbol of friendship which they hope she will foster between people across the world 9 There has been speculation that Hello Kitty has her origins in Man eki Neko a traditional Japanese cat figurine The name Hello Kitty is a back translation of Man eki Neko meaning beckoning cat in English Despite this no definitive statement supports that speculation 27 Hello Kitty has also instead been put forth as an early example of mu koku seki a Japanese term meaning stateless or nation less in reference to characters lacking any identifiable national background 28 The character's first appearance on an item was in March 1975 on a vinyl coin purse sold in Japan where she was pictured sitting between a bottle of milk and a goldfish bowl 13 14 29 She first appeared in the United States in 1976 when Sanrio opened a Gift Gate store in San Jose California 30 31 Hello Kitty sold well immediately after her 1975 launch and Sanrio's sales increased sevenfold 17 Due to Japan's growing economy many Japanese children could afford to buy Hello Kitty products 32 Her popularity also grew with the emergence of kawai i culture which embraces cuteness 16 UNICEF named Hello Kitty as children's ambassador to the United States in 1983 children's ambassador in Japan in 1994 and gave her the title of UNICEF Special Friend of Children in 2004 a title unique to her 33 34 35 Originally Hello Kitty was only marketed towards a child and preteen audience In the 1990 s the target market for Hello Kitty was broadened to include teenagers and adults as a retro brand 9 15 Marketing to those who could not get Hello Kitty merchandise as children and those who fondly remember items they had Sanrio began selling Hello Kitty branded products such as purses and laptops 9 15 17 The 1994 1996 Face series was the first to be designed specifically for mature consumers 9 The Hello Kitty brand rose to greater prominence internationally during the late 1990 s At that time several celebrities such as Mariah Carey had adopted Hello Kitty as a fashion statement 15 New products featuring the character were made available in a large variety of American department stores Hello Kitty's popularity in Japan peaked in the late 1990 s when she was the country's top grossing character In 2002 Hello Kitty lost her place as the top grossing character in Japan in the Character Databank popularity chart In a 2010 survey she was in third place behind An pan man and Pikachu from Pok mon 17 In 2010 The New York Times attributed the character's relative decline in Japan to her biography not being compelling enough to draw many fans The newspaper later wrote that analysts called the characterization weak 17 and that Hello Kitty not having a mouth has dampened her success as an animated TV character 17 According to Character Databank Hello Kitty was the third highest grossing character in Japan as of 2013 36 In 2019 and 2020 Character Databank ranked her fifth and as of 2021 she was out of the top five 37 38 39 Overseas her global popularity has increased over the years 17 According to Sanrio Hello Kitty was appearing on 12 000 new products each year as of 1999 23 Beginning in 2007 following trends in Japan Sanrio began using darker designs for Hello Kitty with more black and less pink and pulled away from kawai i styles 17 By 2008 Hello Kitty was responsible for half of Sanrio's 1 billion net income and there were over 50 000 different Hello Kitty branded products in more than 60 countries 15 By 2010 the character was worth 5 billion a year and The New York Times called her a global marketing phenomenon 17 Worldwide annual sales reached 8 billion in 2013 18 In July 2008 the Dutch artist Dick Bruna creator of M iffy alleged that Hello Kitty is a copy of M iffy being rendered in a similar style He stated disapprovingly in an interview for the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph That is a copy of M iffy I think I don't like that at all I always think ' No don't do that Try to make something that you think of yourself ' 40 Mer c is the firm that managed copyrights for Bruna took Sanrio to court over their Hello Kitty associated character Cathy a rabbit which made her first appearance in 1976 and which Mer c is argued infringed the copyright for M iffy A court in Amsterdam ruled in favour of Mer c is in November 2010 and ordered Sanrio to stop the production and sale of merchandise featuring Cathy in the Benelux countries However in June 2011 the two companies announced that they had reached a settlement agreement to end their legal dispute Sanrio stopped using the Cathy character and the two firms jointly donated 150 000 for reconstruction after the 2011 T hoku earthquake and tsunami 41 As of 2014 90 of the profits from Hello Kitty came from licensing of products for the international market 42 She has been particularly popular in other Asian countries for decades such as in China where her cultural impact is comparable to that of Barbie in the Western world 43 In 2008 Japan named Hello Kitty the ambassador of Japanese tourism in both China and Hong Kong marking the first time Japan's tourism ministry had appointed a fictional character to the role 44 Sharon Kin sell a a lecturer at Oxford University on Japanese sociology called the selection of Hello Kitty a bit farcical as if a dumb ed down cultural icon can somehow do something significant to alter the gnarly and difficult state of China Japan relations 15 In the United States Hello Kitty is recognized by more than 80 of young adults in the 18 23 age group as of 2016 update 45 In 2014 a four day convention Hello Kitty Con in Los Angeles attracted over 25 000 visitors The convention was held in celebration of Hello Kitty's 40 th anniversary 46 Sanrio's Puroland Tokyo theme park also held a celebration spanning several days in November 2014 47 Hello Kitty is a gij inka an anthropomorphism or personification of a Japanese Bobtail cat 48 11 49

several spinoff characters have been created Hello Kitty's boyfriend Dear Daniel in 1999 Charm my Kitty Hello Kitty's pet cat and Sugar her pet hamster both in 2004 and her superhero alter ego Ichigo man in 2011 29 52 SF GATE said in 2004 that in light of the level of success of Hello Kitty her fictional biography seems almost too modest or irrelevant and doesn't seem to have played much of a part in the success 16 In 2014 an anthropologist was told by Sanrio that Kitty White was not simply a cat i e depicted on all four s describing her as a little English girl called Kitty White from outside London 10 Following reports that interpreted this to mean she was human a Sanrio PR representative said that the organization had never said she was a human explaining an thro po morph iz ation by comparing the character to Mickey Mouse No one would mistake the Disney character for a human but at the same time he's not quite a mouse Just like Hello Kitty isn't a human she's not quite a cat either 48 Sanrio stated further Hello Kitty was done in the motif of a cat It's going too far to say that Hello Kitty is not a cat 11 There have been several different animated series starring Hello
