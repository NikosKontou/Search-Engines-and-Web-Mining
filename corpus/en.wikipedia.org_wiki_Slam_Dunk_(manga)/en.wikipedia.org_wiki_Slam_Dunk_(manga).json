    "transformers_text": "Slam Dunk stylized in all caps is a Japanese sports manga series written and illustrated by Take hi ko Inoue It was serialized in Shueisha's sh nen manga magazine Weekly Sh nen Jump from October 1990 to June 1996 with the chapters collected into 31 tank bon volumes The story follows Hanami chi Sakura gi a brash and impulsive high school student who joins a basketball team at Sho hoku High School located in the Sh nan area of Japan The manga was adapted into an anime television series by Toei Animation which aired from October 1993 to March 1996 The series has been broadcast worldwide gaining popularity especially in Japan Europe and several other Asian countries In December 2022 an anime feature film titled The First Slam Dunk was released in Japan Slam Dunk has 185 million copies in circulation making it one of the best selling manga series in history In 1994 it received the 40 th Sho gaku kan Manga Award for the sh nen category In Japan Slam Dunk has been regarded as one of the greatest sports manga series of all time and has been cited as a contributor in popularizing basketball among Japanese youth during the 1990 s In 2010 Inoue received special commendations from the Japan Basketball Association for helping popularize basketball in Japan Hanami chi Sakura gi is a high school delinquent and gang leader He is very unpopular among girls having been rejected fifty times In his first year at Sho hoku High School Sakura gi meets Haru ko A kagi the girl of his dreams and is overjoyed when she is not repulsed or frightened of him like other girls Haru ko recognizes Sakura gi's athletic is m and introduces him to the Sho hoku basketball team Sakura gi is reluctant to play basketball due to his in experience with sports and his belief that basketball is a game for losers This belief came about because the most recent girl to reject him had favored a basketball player Despite his immaturity and temper he joins the team to impress Haru ko and proves to be a natural athlete Sakura gi later develops a genuine love for the sport despite initially playing because of his crush Around this time the star rookie and girl magnet Kaede Ru kawa joins the team Sakura gi views him as a bitter rival in basketball and romance as Haru ko has an unrequited crush on Ru kawa Shortly after two additional members rejoin the team Hisashi Mi tsui a skilled three point shooter and ex junior high school MVP and Ryota Miyagi a short but fast point guard The four players work together to fulfill team captain Takenori A kagi's dream of winning the national championship After defeating one of the powerhouse teams at the national high school championship the misfits gain publicity and the once little known Sho hoku basketball team becomes an all star contender in Japan Take hi ko Inoue was inspired to create Slam Dunk from his love of basketball which he has had since high school 4 Before starting Slam Dunk he created a one shot manga titled Aka ga Suki which was published in Weekly Sh nen Jump Summer Special in 1990 The one shot featured an early prototype of Hanami chi Sakura gi and Haru ko A kagi with a story and character dynamics that laid the groundwork for Slam Dunk 5 After he began working on the series Inoue was surprised to receive letters from readers who had begun playing the sport due to his manga His editor told him basketball was a taboo in this world Due to these letters Inoue decided he wanted to draw better basketball games in the series 4 With the series the author wanted to demonstrate the feelings and thoughts that some athletes might have when they win lose or improve at their sport When he began work on Vagabond Inoue noted that his work on Slam Dunk had a simpler perspective on life as he focused more on victories and success 6 With the series Inoue wanted readers to feel achievements and love for the sport 7 Thinking that his success as a manga artist was largely due to basketball Inoue organized aSlam Dunk scholarship for Japanese students as he wanted to give back to the sport by increasing its popularity in Japan 8 However when asked about the response from readers to basketball Inoue commented that although Slam Dunk is technically a basketball manga its story could have been told with other sports such as football 9 He added that the manga's artwork was more manga like compared to his newer works such as Real His experiences with basketball also influenced the story of Slam Dunk As a youth Inoue began playing basketball to become popular with girls but later developed an interest in the sport itself This experience is mirrored in the character Hanami chi Sakura gi who began playing basketball to impress a girl only to later grow truly fond of the game 10 Inoue attended the NBA Finals in the United States and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona as research for the manga 11 Written and illustrated by Take hi ko Inoue Slam Dunk was

the third best selling manga series in the first half of 2023 period between November 2022 and May 2023 with 4 2 million copies sold 96 Carlo Santos of Anime News Network wrote that With solid characters eye popping action and a classic underdog story Slam Dunk is what all manga series and basketball players should aspire to be the complete package 97 Based on the first volume however his colleague Carl Kimlinger said it came off as more of a romantic comedy than a sports manga as it focused on establishing the cast 98 Santos opined that its the stuff that happens off the court that really makes up the manga's heart and soul as each character has a story to tell and a goal to reach with the court simply providing a stage for them to act out these universal struggles 97 Similarly Kris K osaka of The Japan Times wrote that Slam Dunk is not your typical sports story dominated by on the court heroics but Inoue's love of basketball is evident on every page 99 Sports Illustrated's Ben S in wrote that there are many reasons why Slam Dunk is so beloved including a hilarious rivalry between the main character and his teammate a handsome star player with a large female fanbase and many other characters and subplots which have since become a crucial part of manga lore 100 S in also proclaimed Inoue to have the greatest mix of serious and goofy toned artwork in the history of comics Inoue can draw a stunningly detailed and emotional portrait of a human being in one panel and then do a 180 on that character's facial features the next 100 Kimlinger called Sakura gi an inspired choice for a lead character as he is a thug with a hair trigger temper and all the wrong motivations but said he does the seemingly impossible and balances likeability and extreme hubris thanks to humorous scenes 98 Santos wrote that while Sakura gi may not have the mind blowing superhuman skills we normally associate with sh nen protagonists watching him grow into a sportsman and decent human being is just as exciting 97 Despite having some school punk character designs that are generally considered comedic nowadays Santos called the art solid for its visual flow and sense of motion 97 The anime adaptation has also been very popular in Japan In TV Asahi's 2005 Top 100 Anime survey of multiple age groups Slam Dunk ranked as the eighth most popular anime 101 In another poll from TV Asahi but developed by a website the series ranked tenth 102 The home video release of the anime also had good sales having appeared on Oricon's Japanese Animation DVD and Blu ray rankings 103 104 105 The anime films performed well at the box office The first three films released between 1994 and 1995 grossed 2 47 billion 1 9 billion and 2 16 billion in Japan respectively for a combined 6 53 billion 69 42 million grossed in Japan by 1995 106 The First Slam Dunk released in 2022 grossed over 281 million worldwide as of August 2024 update 107 becoming one of the top ten highest grossing anime films of all time 108 Slam Dunk is often considered as one of the most influential manga series in Japan and one of the greatest sports manga series of all time Its success is cited as a cause for the increased popularity of basketball among the Japanese youth during the 1990 s 109 Alex Wong of Yahoo Sports wrote that the work inspired an entire generation of basketball players in Japan 110 In a dissertation PhD student Dexter Thomas of Cornell University stated The first wave of basketball in Japan was pushed forward by Slam Dunk 111 Professional basketball players Rui Hachi mura and Yuta Watanabe have cited Slam Dunk as inspiring them 110 When he became a naturalized Japanese citizen J R Sakura gi partially took his surname from the Hanami chi Sakura gi character 112 Az usa Takahashi of the Japanese website Real Sound wrote that the appeal of Slam Dunk and the impact it had on the popularity of the sport is rooted in how realistic it is It not only has flashy game scenes but also includes scenes of steady practice 113 The Slam Dunk Scholarship program was created in 2006 by Inoue and Shueisha The winning 17 to 18 year old recipient receives a fully paid academic and athletic scholarship to a university preparatory school in America if they pass the school's admission interview 114 Past recipients of the scholarship include Nari to Nami za to and D aichi Taniguchi 115 In 2010 Inoue received special commendations from the Japan Basketball Association for helping popularize basketball in Japan and the scholarship program 116 According to Wong as of 2019 Slam Dunk has never crossed into the mainstream in North America and Viz editor Michael Montes a stated that in general manga related to sports have not sold as well in the United States 110 The Kamakura k k mae No 1 railroad crossing on the Enoshima Electric Railway has become a popular tourist attraction or se ichi jun rei for fans of Slam Dunk due to being depicted in the opening credits of the manga's anime adaptation 117 118 The resulting over tourism has caused the local government to assign security guards to the location in order to curb troublesome behavior 117 118 Many of the visitors are
