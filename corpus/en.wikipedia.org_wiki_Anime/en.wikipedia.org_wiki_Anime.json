    "transformers_text": "Anime Japanese IPA a ime a derived from a shortening of the English word animation is animation originating from Japan Outside Japan and in English anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan 1 However anime in Japan and in Japanese describes all animated works regardless of style or origin Many works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are also produced outside Japan Video games sometimes also feature themes and art styles that may be labelled as anime The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917 A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960 s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in the following decades developing a large domestic audience Anime is distributed theatrically through television broadcasts directly to home media and over the Internet In addition to original works anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics manga light novels or video games It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences 2 Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies Predominantly hand drawn even into the modern day anime combines graphic art characterization cinematography and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques 3 Compared to Western animation anime production generally focuses less on movement and more on the detail of settings and use of camera effects such as panning zooming and angle shots 3 Diverse art styles are used and character proportions and features can be quite varied with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes 4 The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies including major studios such as Studio Ghibli Kyoto Animation Sunrise Bones Ufo table MAPPA Wit Studio Co Mix Wave Films Madhouse Inc TMS Entertainment Studio Pierrot Production I G Nippon Animation and Toei Animation Since the 1980 s the medium has also seen widespread international success with the rise of foreign dubbed and subtitled programming and since the 2010 s due to the rise of streaming services and a widening demographic embrace of anime culture both within Japan and worldwide 5 6 As of 2016 update Japanese animation accounted for 60 of the world's animated television shows 7 By 2022 anime had become one of the fastest growing genres of content globally 8 The medium is currently characterised by increased globalisation expansive cross cultural collaboration and significant brand integration as Japanese produced animation continues to influence and shape media and popular culture on a global scale 9 As a type of animation anime is an art form that comprises many genres found in other mediums it is sometimes mistakenly classified as a genre itself 10 In Japanese the term anime is used to refer to all animated works regardless of style or origin 11 English language dictionaries typically define anime n me 12 as a style of Japanese animation 13 or as a style of animation originating in Japan 14 Other definitions are based on origin making production in Japan a requisite for a work to be considered anime 15 The etymology of the word anime is disputed The English word animation is written in Japanese katakana as anim shon and as anime pronounced a i me in its shortened form 15 Some sources claim that the term is derived from the French term for animation des s in anim cartoon literally ' animated drawing ' 16 but others believe this to be a myth derived from the popularity of anime in France in the late 1970 s and 1980 s 15 In English anime when used as a common noun normally functions as a mass noun For example Do you watch anime or How much anime have you watched 17 18 As with a few other Japanese words such as sak and Pok mon English texts sometimes spell anime as anim as in French with an acute accent over the finale to cue the reader to pronounce the letter not to leave it silent as English orthography may suggest Prior to the widespread use of anime the term Japan imation a portmanteau of Japan and animation was prevalent throughout the 1970 s and 1980 s In the mid 1980 s the term anime began to supplant Japan imation 19 in general the latter term now only appears in period works where it is used to distinguish and identify Japanese animation 20 Ema kimono and shadow plays k age e are considered precursors to Japanese animation 21 Ema kimono was a common form of entertainment in the 11 th century Traveling storytellers narrated legends and anecdotes while the ema kimono was unrolled from the right to left in chronological order as a moving panorama 21 K age e was popular during the Edo period and originated from the shadow plays of China 21 Magic lanterns from the Netherlands were also popular in the 18 th century 21 The paper play called kami shibai surged in the 12 th century and remained popular in street theater until the 1930 s 21 Puppets of the Bunraku theater and ukiyo e prints are considered ancestors of characters of most Japanese animation 21 Finally manga was a heavy inspiration for anime Cartoonists K itza wa Rak u ten and Okamoto Ippei used film elements in their strips 21 Animation in Japan began in the early 20 th century when filmmakers started to experiment with techniques pioneered in France Germany the United States and Russia 22 A claim for the earliest Japanese animation is Kat sud S hash in c 1907 23 a private work by an unknown creator 24 In 1917 the first professional and publicly displayed works began to appear animators such as ten Shimokawa Sei tar Kita yama and Jun ' ichi K uchi known as the fathers of anime produced numerous films with the oldest surviving one being K uchi's Nama kura Ga tana 25 Many early works were lost in the destruction of Shimokawa's warehouse during the 1923 Great Kant earthquake 26 By the mid 1930 s animation was well established in Japan as an alternative format to live action works It suffered competition from foreign producers such as Disney and many animators including No bur fujian dYas uji Murata continued to work with cheaper cut out animation rather than cel animation 27 Other creators including Kenz Masaoka and M its u yo Seo nevertheless made great strides in technique benefiting from the patronage of the government which employed animators to produce educational shorts and propaganda 28 In 1940 the government dissolved several artists ' organizations to form the Shin Nippon Mangaka Ky kai b 29 The first talk ie anime was Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka 1933 a short film produced by Masaoka 30 31 The first feature length anime film was Momotar o Sacred Sailors 1945 produced by Seo with a sponsorship from the Imperial Japanese Navy 32 The 1950 s saw a proliferation of short animated advertisements created for television 33 In the 1960 s manga artist and animator Osamu Tezuka adapted and simplified Disney animation techniques to reduce costs and limit frame counts in his productions 34 Originally intended as temporary measures to allow him to produce material on a tight schedule with inexperienced staff many of his limited animation practices came to define the medium's style 35 Three Tales 1960 was the first anime film broadcast on television 36 the first anime television series was Instant History 1961 64 37 An early and influential success was Astro Boy 1963 66 a television series directed by Tezuka based on his manga of the same name Many animators at Tezuka's Mush i Production later established major anime studios among those being Madhouse Sunrise and Studio Pierrot The 1970 s saw growth in the popularity of manga many of which later received animated adaptations Tezuka's work and that of other pioneers in the field inspired characteristics and genres that remain fundamental elements of anime today The giant robot genre also known as mecha for instance took shape under Tezuka developed into the super robot genre underGo Nagai and others and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by Yoshiyuki To mino who developed the real robot genre 38 Robot anime series such as Gundam Space Runaway Ide on 39 and Super Dimension Fortress Macross were influential classics in the 1980 s and the genre remained one of the most popular in the following decades 40 The bubble economy of the 1980 s spurred a new era of high budget and experimental anime films including Nausica of the Valley of the Wind 1984 Royal Space Force The Wings of Hon n a mise 1987 and Akira 1988 41 Experimental anime titles continued to draw attention in the 1990 s as Neon Genesis Evangelion 1995 Ghost in the Shell 1995 and Cowboy Bebop 1998 garnered international popularity During this period anime began attracting greater interest in Western countries other international successes include Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball Z both of which were dubbed into more than a dozen languages worldwide In 2003 Spirited Away a Studio Ghibli feature film directed by Hayao Miyazaki won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75 th Academy Awards It later became the highest grossing anime film c grossing more than 355 million worldwide Since the 2000 s an increased number of anime works have been adaptations of light novels and visual novels successful examples include The Melancholy of Haruhi Su zu miya and Fate stay night both 2006 Demon Slayer Kim e tsu no Yai ba the Movie Mugen Train became the highest grossing Japanese film and one of the world's highest grossing films of 2020 42 43 It also became the fastest grossing film in Japanese cinema history earning 10 billion yen 95 3 m 72 m in 10 days 43 It beat the previous record holder Spirited Away which took 25 days to gross the same amount 43 44 45 46 47 In 2021 the anime adaptations of Jujutsu Kai sen Demon Slayer Kim e tsu no Yai ba and Tokyo Revenge rs were among the top 10 most discussed TV shows worldwide on Twitter 48 49 In 2022 Attack on Titan won the award of Most In Demand TV Series in the World 2021 at the Global TV Demand Awards Attack on Titan became the first ever non English language series to earn the title of World's Most In Demand TV Show previously held by only The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones 50 In 2024 Jujutsu Kai sen broke the Guinness World Record for the Most in demand animated TV show with a global demand rating 71 2 times than that of the average TV show previously held by Attack on Titan 51 52 Anime differs from other forms of animation with its art styles methods of animation production and process Visually anime works exhibit a wide variety of art styles differing between creators artists and studios 53 While no single art style predominates anime as a whole they do share some similar attributes in terms of animation technique and character design Anime is fundamentally characterized by the use of limited animation flat expression the suspension of time its thematic range the presence of historical figures its complex narrative line and above all a peculiar drawing style with characters characterized by large and oval eyes with very defined lines bright colors and reduced movement of the lips 54 55 Modern anime follows a typical animation production process involving storyboarding voice acting character design and cel production Since the 1990 s animators have increasingly used computer animation to improve the efficiency of the production process Early anime works were experimental and consisted of images drawn on blackboards stop motion animation of paper cutouts and silhouette animation 56 57 Cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium In the 21 st century the use of other animation techniques is mostly limited to independent short films 58 including the stop motion puppet animation work produced by Tada hito Mochi naga Ki hachi r Kawamoto and Tomoyasu Murata 59 60 Computers were integrated into the animation process in the 1990 s with works such as Ghost in the Shell 1995 and Princess Mon on oke 1997 mixing cel animation with computer generated imagery 61 Fuji Film a major cel production company announced it would cease cel production causing an industry panic to procure cel imports and hastening the switch to digital processes 61 Prior to the digital era anime was produced with traditional animation methods using a pose to pose approach 56 The majority of mainstream anime uses fewer expressive key frames and more in between animation 62 Japanese animation studios were pioneers of many limited animation techniques and have given anime a distinct set of conventions Unlike Disney animation where the emphasis is on the movement anime emphasizes the art quality and lets limited animation techniques make up for the lack of time spent on movement Such techniques are often used not only to meet deadlines but also as artistic devices 63 Anime scenes often place emphasis on achieving three dimensional views and backgrounds are instrumental in creating the atmosphere of the work 22 The backgrounds are not always purely fictional and are occasionally based on real locations as exemplified in Howl's Moving Castle and The Melancholy of Haruhi Su zu miya 64 better source needed John Opp liger stated that anime is one of the rare mediums where putting together an all star cast usually comes out looking tremendously impressive 65 The cinematic effects of anime differentiates itself from the stage plays found in American animation Anime is cinematic ally shot as if by camera including panning zooming and distance and angle shots to more complex dynamic shots that would be difficult to produce in reality 66 67 68 In anime the animation is almost always produced before the voice acting contrary to American animation where the voice acting typically comes first 69 The body proportions of human anime characters tend to accurately reflect the proportions of the human body in reality The height of the head is usually considered by the artist as the base unit of proportion Head to height ratios vary drastically by art style with most anime characters falling between 5 and 8 heads tall Anime artists occasionally make deliberate modifications to body proportions to produce chibi characters that feature a disproportionately small body compared to the head many chibi characters are two to four heads tall Some anime works like Crayon Shin chan completely disregard these proportions in such a way that they resemble caricatured Western cartoons A common anime character design convention is exaggerated eye size The animation of characters with large eyes in anime can be traced back to Osamu Tezuka who was deeply influenced by such early animation characters such as the ones by Walt Disney and Betty Boo p who were drawn with disproportionately large eyes 70 Tezuka is a central figure in anime and manga history whose iconic art style and character designs allowed for the entire range of human emotions to be depicted solely through the eyes 71 The artist may add variable color shading to the eyes and particularly to the cornea to give them greater depth Generally a mixture of a light shade the tone color and a dark shade is used 72 73 However not all anime characters have large eyes For example the works of Hayao Miyazaki are known for having realistically proportioned eyes as well as realistic hair colors on their characters 74 Hair in anime is often unnaturally lively and colorful or uniquely styled The movement of hair in anime is exaggerated and hair actions are used to emphasize the action and emotions of characters for added visual effect 75 Artist Gilles Po it ras traces hairstyle color to cover illustrations on manga where eye catching artwork and colorful tones are considered appealing for children's manga 75 Some anime will depict non Japanese characters with specific ethnic features such as a pronounced nose and jutting jaw for European characters 76 In other cases anime feature characters whose ethnicity or nationality is not always defined and this is often a deliberate decision such as in the Pok mon animated series 77 Anime and manga artists often draw from a common canon of iconic facial expression illustrations to denote particular moods and thoughts 78 These techniques are often different in form than their counterparts in Western animation and they include a fixed iconography that is used as shorthand for certain emotions and moods 79 For example a male character may develop a nosebleed when sexually aroused 79 A variety of visual symbols are employed including sweat drops to depict nervousness symbolized red veins for anger visible blushing for embarrassment or glowing eyes for an intense glare 80 Another recurring sight gag is the use of chibi deformed simplified character designs figures to co medically punctuate emotions like confusion or embarrassment 79 The opening and credits sequences of most anime television series are accompanied by J pop or J rock songs often by reputed bands as written with the series in mind but are also aimed at the general music market therefore they often allude only vaguely or not at all to the thematic settings or plot of the series Also they are often used as incidental music insert songs in an episode in order to highlight particularly important scenes 81 better source needed Future funk a musical micro genre that evolved in the early 2010 s from vapor wave with a French house and Euro disco influence heavily uses anime visuals and samples along with Japanese city pop to build an aesthetic 82 Since the 2020 s anime songs have experienced a rapid growth in global online popularity due to their widened availability on music streaming services such as Spot if y and promotion by fans and artists on social media 83 In 2023 the opening theme Idol by Yo as obi of the anime serie sO shi no Ko topped the Billboard Global 200 Ex cl U S charts with 45 7 million streams and 24 000 copies sold outside the U S Idol has become the first Japanese song and anime song to top the Billboard Global chart as well as to take the top spot on Apple Music's Top 100 Global chart 84 85 Anime are often classified by target demographic including children's kod omo girls ' sh jo boys ' sh nen young men seinen young women josei and a diverse range of genres targeting an adult audience Sh jo and sh nen anime sometimes contain elements popular with children of all genders in an attempt to gain crossover appeal Adult anime may feature a slower pace or greater plot complexity that younger audiences may typically find unappealing as well as adult themes and situations 86 A subset of adult anime works featuring pornographic elements are labeled R 18 in Japan and are internationally known as hentai originating from the Japanese word for pervert hentai By contrast some anime subgenres incorporate ecchi sexual themes or undertones without depictions of sexual intercourse as typified in the comedic or harem genres due to its popularity among adolescent and adult anime enthusiasts the inclusion of such elements is considered a form of fan service 87 88 Some genres explore homosexual romances such as yaoi male homosexuality and yuri female homosexuality While often used in a pornographic context the terms yaoi and yuri can also be used broadly in a wider context to describe or focus on the themes or the development of the relationships themselves 89 Anime's genre classification differs from other types of animation and does not lend itself to simple classification 90 Gilles Po it ras compared the labeling of Gundam 0080 and its complex depiction of war as a giant robot anime akin to simply labeling War and Peace a war novel 90 Science fiction is a major anime genre and includes important historical works like Tezuka's Astro Boy and Yokoyama's Tetsu j in 28 go A major subgenre of science fiction is mecha with the Gundam meta series being iconic 91 The diverse fantasy genre includes works based on Asian and Western traditions and folklore examples include the Japanese feudal fairytale Inuyasha and the depiction of Scandinavian goddesses who move to Japan to maintain a computer called Yggdrasil in Ah My Goddess 92 Genre crossing in anime is also prevalent such as the blend of fantasy and comedy in Dragon Half and the incorporation of slapstick humor in the crime anime film Castle of C agli ostr o 93 Other subgenres found in anime include magical girl harem sports martial arts literary adaptations medieval is m 94 and war 95 Early anime works were made for theatrical viewing and required played musical components before sound and vocal components were added to the production In 1958 Nippon Television aired M ogura no A ban ch ru Mole's Adventure both the first televised and first color anime to debut 96 It was not until the 1960 s when the first televised series were broadcast and it has remained a popular medium since 97 Works released in a direct to video format are known as original video animations OVAs or original animation videos O A Vs and are typically not released theatrically or televised prior to home media release 98 99 better source needed The emergence of the Internet has led some animators to distribute works online in a format called original net animation ON A 100 better source needed The home distribution of anime releases was popularized in the 1980 s with the VHS and LaserDisc formats 98 The VHS NTSC video format used in both Japan and the United States is credited with aiding the rising popularity of anime in the 1990 s 98 The LaserDisc and VHS formats were transcended by the DVD format which offered unique advantages including multiple subtitling and dubbing tracks on the same disc 101 The DVD format also had its drawbacks in its usage of region coding adopted by the industry to combat licensing piracy and exporting as well as usage in restricted regions indicated on the DVD player 101 The Video CD VCD format was popular in Hong Kong and Taiwan but became only a minor format in the United States that was closely associated with bootleg copies 101 Whereas many American television series had an episodic format with each episode typically consisting of a self contained story anime series such as Dragon Ball Z had a serialization format where continuous story arcs stretch over multiple episodes or seasons thus distinguishing them from traditional American shows serialization has since also become a common characteristic of American streaming television shows during the Golden Age of Television era 102 The animation industry consists of more than 430 production companies with some of the major and most prominent studios including Toei Animation Madhouse Gonzo Sunrise Bones TMS Entertainment Nippon Animation P A Works Studio Pierrot Production I G Ufo table and Studio Ghibli 103 Many of the studios are organized into a trade association The Association of Japanese Animations There is also a labor union for workers in the industry the Japanese Animation Creators Association Studios will often work together to produce more complex and costly projects as done with Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away 103 An anime episode can cost between US 100 000 and US 300 000 to produce 104 In 2001 animation accounted for 7 of the Japanese film market above the 4 6 market share for live action works 103 The popularity and success of anime is seen through the profitability of the DVD market contributing nearly 70 of total sales 103 According to a 2016 article on Nik kei Asian Review Japanese television stations have bought over 60 billion worth of anime from production companies over the past few years compared with under 20 billion from overseas 105 There has been a rise in sales of shows to television stations in Japan caused by late night anime with adults as the target demographic 105 This type of anime is less popular outside Japan being considered more of a niche product 105 Spirited Away 2001 was the all time highest grossing film in Japan until it was overtaken by Demon Slayer Kim e tsu no Yai ba The Movie Mugen Train in 2020 106 107 108 It was also the highest grossing anime film worldwide until it was overtaken by Makoto Shin kai's 2016 film Your Name 109 Anime films represent a large part of the highest grossing Japanese films yearly in Japan with 6 out of the top 10 in 2014 2015 and 2016 Anime has to be licensed by companies in other countries in order to be legally released While anime has been licensed by its Japanese owners for use outside Japan since at least the 1960 s the practice became well established in the United States in the late 1970 s to early 1980 s when such TV series as Gat chaman and Captain Har lock were licensed from their Japanese parent companies for distribution in the American market The trend towards American distribution of anime continued into the 1980 s with the licensing of titles such as Volt ron and the ' creation ' of new series such as Robot ech through the use of source material from several original series 110 In the early 1990 s several companies began to experiment with the licensing of less child oriented material Some such as A D Vision and Central Park Media and its imprints achieved fairly substantial commercial success and went on to become major players in the now very lucrative American anime market Others such as AnimE igo achieved limited success Many companies created directly by Japanese parent companies did not do as well most releasing only one or two titles before completing their American operations citation needed Licenses are expensive often costing hundreds of thousands of dollars for one series and tens of thousands for one movie 111 The prices vary widely for example J in ki Extend costed only 91 000 to license while Kura u Phantom Memory costed 960 000 111 Simulcast Internet streaming rights can be cheaper with prices around 1 000 2 000 an episode 112 but can also be more expensive with some series costing more than US 200 000 per episode 113 The anime market for the United States was worth approximately 2 74 billion in 2009 114 Dubbed animation began airing in the United States in 2000 on networks like The WB and Cartoon Network's Adult Swim 115 In 2005 this resulted in five of the top ten anime titles having previously aired on Cartoon Network 115 As a part of localization some editing of cultural references may occur to better follow the references of the non Japanese culture 116 The cost of English localization averages US 10 000 per episode 117 The industry has been subject to both praise and condemnation for fan subs the addition of unlicensed and unauthorized subtitled translations of anime series or films 118 Fan subs which were originally distributed on bootlegged VHS cassettes in the 1980 s have been freely available and disseminated online since the 1990 s 118 Since this practice raises concerns for copyright and piracy issues fans ubbe rs tend to adhere to an unwritten moral code to destroy or no longer distribute an anime once an officially translated or subtitled version becomes licensed They also try to encourage viewers to buy an official copy of the release once it comes out in English although fan subs typically continue to circulate through file sharing networks 119 Even so the laid back regulations of the Japanese animation industry tend to overlook these issues allowing it to grow underground and thus increasing its popularity until there is a demand for official high quality releases for animation companies This has led to an increase in global popularity of Japanese animation reaching 40 million in sales in 2004 120 Fan sub practices have rapidly declined since the early 2010 s due to the advent of legal streaming services which simulcast new anime series often within a few hours of their domestic release 121 Since the 2010 s anime has become a global multi billion dollar industry setting a sales record in 2017 of 2 15 trillion 19 8 billion driven largely by demand from overseas audiences 122 In 2019 Japan's anime industry was valued at 24 billion a year with 48 of that revenue coming from overseas which is now its largest industry sector 123 By 2025 the anime industry is expected to reach a value of 30 billion with over 60 of that revenue coming from overseas 124 The Japan External Trade Organization JET RO valued the domestic anime market in Japan at 2 4 trillion 24 billion including 2 trillion from licensed products in 2005 125 JET RO reported sales of overseas anime exports in 2004 to be 2 trillion 18 billion 126 JET RO valued the anime market in the United States at 520 billion 5 2 billion 125 including 500 million in home video sales and over 4 billion from licensed products in 2005 127 JET RO projected in 2005 that the worldwide anime market including sales of licensed products would grow to 10 trillion 100 billion 125 127 The anime market in China was valued at 21 billion in 2017 128 and was projected to reach 31 billion by 2020 129 In Europe the anime merchandising market was valued at about 950 million with the figurine segment accounting for most of the share and is expected to reach a value of over 2 billion by 2030 130 The global anime market size was valued at 26 055 billion in 2021 with 29 of the revenue coming from merchandise It is expected that the global anime market will reach a value of 47 14 billion by 2028 131 132 In 2023 the anime industry generated 19 8 billion in total global revenue including 5 5 billion from streaming and 14 3 billion from merchandise sales North America and Asia contributed a combined 14 3 billion in total revenue accounting for over 72 of anime's global impact 133 134 By 2030 the global anime market is expected to reach a value of 48 3 billion with the largest contributors to this growth being North America Europe Asia Pacific and the Middle East 135 The global anime market size was valued at 25 8 billion in 2022 and is expected to increase to 62 7 billion by 2032 with aC AGR of 9 4 136 137 138 In 2019 the annual overseas exports of Japanese animation exceeded 10 billion for the first time in history 139 According to Dents u s 2025 Global Research Report Anime A Growing Opportunity for Brands data collected between October 2024 and March 2025 from 8 600 consumers across 10 countries the United States United Kingdom Poland Spain France Italy Japan China Indonesia and Thailand showed

Animation Kobe Awards the Japan Media Arts Festival animation awards the Seiy u Awards for voice actors the Tokyo Anime Award and the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year Internationally anime TV series and films compete in shows such as the Crunchy roll Anime Awards and The Astra Awards There were also the American Anime Awards which were designed to recognize excellence in anime titles nominated by the industry though it was held only once in 2006 141 Anime productions have also been nominated and won awards not exclusively for anime like the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature or the Golden Bear In recent years the anime industry has been accused by both Japanese and foreign media of overworking and underpaying its animators 142 143 144 In response Japanese Prime Minister Fu mio K ishida promised to improve the working conditions and salary of all animators and creators working in the industry 145 A few anime studios such as MAPPA have taken actions to improve the working conditions of their employees 146 There was a slight increase in production costs and animator salaries during the C OVID 19 pandemic 147 Throughout 2020 and 2021 the American streaming service Netflix announced that it would greatly invest and fund the anime industry as well as support training programs for new animators 148 149 150 On April 27 2023 the Nippon Anime Film Culture Association N AFC A was officially founded The association aims to address and solve problems in the industry including the improvement of working conditions for animators 151 152 The Japanese government is actively working to improve the working conditions within the anime industry as part of its broader initiative to support and further expand the sector in order to sustain its growing global demand 153 Anime has become commercially profitable in the Western world 155 156 157 as demonstrated by early commercially successful Western adaptations of anime such as Astro Boy and Speed Racer Early American adaptions in the 1960 s made Japan expand into the continental European market first with productions aimed at European and Japanese children such as Heidi Vicky the Viking and Barb a papa which aired in various countries Italy Spain and France 158 159 developed a particular interest in Japan's output due to its cheap selling price and productive output As of 2014 Italy imported the most anime outside Japan 160 Anime and manga were introduced to France in the late 1970 s and became massively popular in spite of amoral panic led by French politicians in the 1980 s and 1990 s 161 These mass imports influenced anime's popularity in East Asian 162 163 164 Southeast Asian 165 South Asian 166 167 Latin American 168 169 Arabic 170 171 Israeli 172 and German markets 173 The beginning of 1980 saw the introduction of Japanese anime series into the American market 174 In the 1990 s Japanese animation slowly gained popularity in the United States as media companies such as Viz and Mix x began publishing and releasing animated works into the American market 175 The 1988 film Akira is largely credited with popularizing anime in the Western world during the early 1990 s before anime was further popularized by television shows such as Pok mon and Dragon Ball Z in the latter part of the decade 176 177 By 1997 Japanese anime was the fastest growing genre in the American video industry 178 The growth of the Internet later provided international audiences with an easy way to access Japanese content 120 Early on online piracy played a major role in this through over time legal alternatives appeared which significantly reduced illegal practices 179 Since the 2010 s streaming services have become increasingly involved in the production licensing and distribution of anime for international markets 180 181 This is especially the case with net services such as Netflix Crunchy roll and others which have large catalogs in many countries although until 2020 anime fans in multiple developing countries had fewer options for obtaining access to legal content and therefore would still turn to online piracy 182 183 However beginning with the 2020 s anime has been experiencing yet another boom in global popularity and demand due to the C OVID 19 pandemic and streaming services like Netflix Amazon Prime Video HBO Max Disney Hul u and anime only services like Crunchy roll and Hi dive increasing the international availability of the amount of newly licensed anime shows as well as the size of their catalogs 184 185 186 187 188 Netflix reported that between

the Japanese language 197 The word anime alongside other Japanese pop cultural terms like shonen sho jo and is eka i have been added to the Oxford English Dictionary 198 199 Various anime and manga series have influenced Hollywood in the making of numerous famous movies and characters 200 Hollywood itself has produced live action adaptations of various anime series such as Ghost in the Shell Death Note Dragon Ball and Cowboy Bebop However most of these adaptations have been received negatively by both critics and audiences and became box office bombs The primary reasons for the unsuccessful ness of Hollywood's adaptions of anime are due to change of plot and characters from the original source material and the limited capabilities a live action movie or series has in comparison to an animated counterpart 201 202 One of the few particular exceptions to this trend is A lita Battle Angel which became a moderate commercial success and received generally positive reviews from both critics and audiences for its visual effects and faithfulness to the source material The movie grossed 404 million worldwide making it director Robert Rodriguez's highest grossing film 203 204 Anime has significantly influenced fashion by blending bold visual storytelling with distinctive character aesthetics inspiring everything from street wear and cosplay culture to high fashion collaborations 205 Anime and manga alongside many other imports of Japanese pop culture have helped build a positive worldwide image toward Japan and improve its relations with other countries 206 207 208 In 2015 during remarks welcoming Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo A be to the White House President Barack Obama thanked Japan for its cultural contributions to the United States by saying This visit is a celebration of the ties of friendship and family that bind our peoples I first felt it when I was 6 years old when my mother took me to Japan I felt it growing up in Hawaii like communities across our country home to so many proud Japanese Americans Today is also a chance for Americans especially our young people to say thank you for all the things we love from Japan Like karate and karaoke Manga and anime And of course emo j is 209 In July 2020 after the approval of a Chilean government project in which citizens of Chile would be allowed to withdraw up to 10 of their privately held retirement savings journalist Pamela Ji les celebrated by running through Congress with her arms spread out behind her imitating the move of many characters of the manga and anime series Naruto 210 211 In April 2021 Peruvian politicians Jorge Hugo Romero of the PPC and Milagro s Ju rez of the UP P cos played as anime characters to get the otaku vote 212 On October 28 2024 the Vatican unveiled its own anime styled mascot Luce in order to connect with Catholic youth through pop culture 213 In April 2023 the Japan Business Federation laid out a proposal aiming to spur the economic growth of Japan by further promoting the contents industry abroad primarily anime manga and video games for measures to invite industry experts from abroad to come to Japan to work and to link with the tourism sector to help foreign fans of manga and anime visit sites across the country associated with particular manga stories The federation seeks on quadrupling the sales of Japanese content in overseas markets within the upcoming 10 years 214 215 A 2018 survey conducted in 20 countries and territories using a sample consisting of 6 600 respondents held by Dents u revealed that 34 of all surveyed people found excellency in anime and manga more than other Japanese cultural or technological aspects which makes this mass Japanese media the third most liked Japanese thing below Japanese cuisine 34 6 and Japanese robotics 35 1 The advertisement company views anime as a profitable tool for marketing campaigns in foreign countries due to its popularity and reception 216 Anime plays a role in driving tourism to Japan In surveys held by Statist a between 2019 and 2020 24 2 of tourists from the United States 7 7 of tourists from China and 6 1 of tourists from South Korea said they were motivated to visit Japan because of Japanese popular culture 217 In a 2021 survey held by Crunchy roll market research 94 of Gen Zand 73 of the general population said that they were familiar with anime 218 219 Anime clubs gave rise to anime conventions in the 1990 s with the anime boom a period marked by anime's increased global popularity 220 These conventions are dedicated to anime and manga and include elements like cosplay contests and industry talk panels 221 Cosplay a portmanteau of costume play is not unique to anime and has become popular in contests and masquerades at anime conventions 222 Japanese culture and words have entered English usage through the popularity of the medium including otaku an unflattering Japanese term commonly used in English to denote an obsessive fan of anime or manga 223 Another word that has arisen describing obsessive fans in the United States is wa panes e referring to white individuals who want to be Japanese or later known as wee a boo or we eb individuals who demonstrate an obsession with Japanese anime a term that originated from abusive content posted on the website 4 chan org 224 While originally derogatory the terms otaku and we eb have been re appropriated by the anime fandom overtime and today are used by some fans to refer to themselves in a comedic and more positive way 225 Anime enthusiasts have produced fan fiction and fan art including computer wallpapers and anime music videos AM Vs 226 Many fans visit sites depicted in anime games manga and other forms of otaku culture This behavior is known as anime pilgrimage 227 By the 2020 s anime had firmly established itself as a major global cultural force resonating with audiences far beyond its origins in Japan Over half of Generation Z worldwide identified as anime fans reflecting the medium s widespread appeal across cultures and languages The growing international enthusiasm for anime has been attributed to its emotional depth distinctive visual style and ability to explore universal themes such as identity friendship and perseverance Its influence can be seen in global entertainment fashion and online communities demonstrating how anime has evolved from a regional art form into a defining element of modern pop culture 228 229 As of the 2020 s many anime fans and followers use social media platforms and other sites like YouTube Bil ibi li 230 Twitch 231 Fandom 232 Facebook Insta gram Reddit Discord 233 Tumblr 234 4 chan Tik Tok and Twitter 49 with online communities and databases such as IMDb and My Anime List to discuss anime manga and track their progress watching respective series as well as using news outlets such as Anime News Network 235 236 According to Crunchy roll's research data from 2023 to 2024 provided by its President Rah ul Par in i there are approximately 800 million people globally outside of China and Japan who are either highly aware of anime show interest in anime or currently watch anime and identify as fans 237 238 239 According to a 2024 survey conducted on anime fans by Polygon 65 of the surveyed anime fans said that they find anime more emotionally compelling than other forms of media and more than 3 in 4 of millennial and Gen Z fans use the medium as a form of escapism Almost two thirds of the anime watching Gen Z audience said they emotionally connect better with anime than they do with traditional media Over 50 of surveyed Gen Z anime fans said that anime influences their identity fashion and social understanding 240 Due to anime's increased popularity in the 21 st century a large number of celebrities such as El on Musk BTS and Ariana Grande have stated that they are anime fans 241 One of the key points that differentiated anime from a handful of Western cartoons is the potential for visceral content Once the expectation that the aspects of visual intrigue or animation are just for children is put aside the audience can realize that themes involving violence suffering sexuality pain and death can all be storytelling elements utilized in anime just as much as other media 242 Japanese animation is so different from what airs here It's far edgier more adult and violent However as anime itself became increasingly popular its styling has been inevitably the subject of both satire and serious creative productions 15 South Park's Chin pok om on and Good Times with Weapons episodes Adult Swim's Perfect Hair Forever and Nickelodeon's Kappa Mikey are examples of Western satirical depictions of Japanese culture and anime but anime tropes have also been satirized by some anime such as Kono Suba Traditionally only Japanese works have been considered anime but some works have sparked debate about blurring the lines between anime and cartoons such as the American anime style productions Avatar The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra 244 These anime styled works have become defined as anime influenced animation in an attempt to classify all anime styled works of non Japanese origin 245 Some creators of these works cite anime as a source of inspiration for example the French production team for ban Star Racers moved to Tokyo to collaborate with a Japanese production team 246 247 248 When anime is defined as a style rather than as a national product it leaves open the possibility of anime being produced in other countries 244 but this has been contentious amongst fans with John Opp liger stating The insistence on referring to original American art as Japanese anime or manga robs the work of its cultural identity 15 249 While some anime will depict non Japanese characters with specific ethnic features such as a pronounced nose and jutting jaw for European characters 76 there are some styles that deliberately for go any identification of its characters with real world ethnicities or nationalities termed in criticism as mu koku seki stateless ness Mu koku seki characters can significantly impact the reception of a property outside of Japan 250 251 AU A E Filipino produced TV series called Tor kaizer is dubbed as the Middle East's First Anime Show and is currently in production 252 and looking for funding 253 needs update Netflix has produced multiple anime series in collaboration with Japanese animation studios 254 and in doing so has offered a more accessible channel for distribution to Western markets 255 Similar initiatives have been enacted by the US based streaming service Crunchy roll 256 producing titles such as High Guardian Spice and an adaptation of Tower of God The web based series RW BY produced by Texas based company Rooster Teeth is produced using an anime art style and the series has been described as anime by multiple sources For example Ad week in the headline to one of its articles described the series as American made anime 257 and in another headline The Huffington Post described it as simply anime without referencing its country of origin 258 In 2013 Monty Ou m the creator of RW BY said Some believe just like Scotch needs to be made in Scotland an American company can't make anime I think that's a narrow way of seeing it Anime is an art form and to say only one country can make this art is wrong 259 RW BY has been released in Japan with a Japanese dub 260 the CEO of Rooster Teeth Matt Hull um commented This is the first time any American made anime has been marketed to Japan It definitely usually works the other way around and we're really pleased about that 257 In Japanese culture and entertainment the term media mix refers to a strategy to disperse content across multiple representations different broadcast media gaming platforms cell phones toys amusement parks and other methods 261 It is the Japanese term for a trans media franchise 262 263 The term gained circulation in the late 1980 s but the origins of the strategy can be traced back to the 1960 s with the proliferation of anime with its interconnection of media and commodity goods 264 A number of anime and manga media franchises such as Demon Slayer Kim e tsu no Yai ba Dragon Ball Fate stay night Yu Gi Oh Neon Genesis Evangelion and Gundam have gained considerable global popularity and are among the world's highest grossing media franchises Pok mon in particular is estimated to be the highest grossing media franchise of all time 265",
