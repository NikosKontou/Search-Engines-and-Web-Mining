Jump magazines Kodansha's Sh nen Magazine Comics Sho gaku kan's Sh nen Sunday Comics and Akita Shot en sSh nen Champion Comics Increasingly after 1959 citation needed manga came to be published in thick phone book sized weekly or monthly anthology manga magazines such as Weekly Sh nen Magazine or Weekly Sh nen Jump These anthologies often have hundreds of pages and dozens of individual series by multiple authors They are printed on cheap newsprint and are considered disposable Since the 1930 s though comic strips had been compiled into tank bon collecting multiple installments from a single series and reprinting them in a roughly paperback sized volume on higher quality paper than in the original magazine printing 1 Strips in manga magazines and tank ob on are typically printed in black and white but sometimes certain sections may be printed in colour or using colored inks or paper In English while a tank bon translation is usually marketed as a graphic novel or trade paperback the transliterated terms tank o ubon and tank bon are sometimes used amongst online communities Japanese speakers frequently refer to manga tank bon by the English loanword comics kom ikk usu 2 although it is more widespread for being used in place of the word manga as they are the same thing The term also refers to the format itself a comic collection in a trade paperback sized roughly 13 cm 18 cm 5 in 7 in book as opposed to the larger 18 cm 25 cm 7 in 10 in format used by traditional American graphic novels 3 Although Japanese manga tank ob on may be in various sizes the most common are Japanese B 6 12 8 cm 18 2 cm 5 04 in 7 17 in and ISO A 5 14 8 cm 21 0 cm 5 83 in 8 27 in The tank bon format has made inroads in the American comics market with several major publishers opting to release some of their titles in this smaller format which is sometimes also called digest format or digest size In the United States many manga are released in the so called Tokyopop trim or Tokyopop size approximately 13 cm 19 cm 5 in 7 5 in 4 An aiz ban lit cherished edition is a collector's edition volume These volumes are generally more expensive and lavished with special features such as a special cover created specifically for the edition a special paper used for the cover higher quality paper a special slip case etc Aiz ban are generally printed in a limited run there by increasing the value and collect ability of those few copies made The aiz ban format has begun to make inroads into the US market with titles such as Fruits Basket and Mobile Suit Gundam The Origin being reissued in a similar format A bunk oban lit paperback edition edition refers to a tank bon printed in bunk o format or a typical Japanese novel sized volume Bunk oban are generally A 6 size 105 mm 148 mm 4 1 in 5 8 in and thicker than tank bon and in the case of manga usually have a new cover designed specifically for the release In the case of manga a bunk oban tends to contain considerably more pages than a tank bon and usually is a re publication of tank bon of the same title which may or may not have been out of print 5 Thus the bunk o edition of a given manga will consist of fewer volumes For example Please Save My Earth was published in 21 tank bon volumes and then re released in 12 bunk o volumes 6 If the original manga was a wide ban release the bunk oban release will generally have the same number of volumes Ag ka aiz ban lit luxury collector's edition is another term occasionally used to designate a type of special release 7 The kan zen ban lit complete edition is yet another term sometimes used to denote a type of special release Aka nzen ban release is generally A 5 size 148 mm 210 mm 5 8 in 8 3 in and will typically reproduce individual chapter covers colour pages and side stories from its original magazine run features that are often omitted or converted to grayscale in standard tank bon releases While the aiz ban appellation emphasizes the value of the volumes the term kan zen ban emphasizes their completeness Similar to a wide ban a shins ban lit redecorated edition or toku s ban lit specially bound edition is a special edition released usually with a new cover The volumes in such a release usually have new colour pages and other extras For example in 2003 Sailor Moon was re edited some pages were completely redrawn and most dialogues were rewritten by the author The chapters were re divided to fit into 12 volumes instead of 18 8 The s sh hen lit compilation is a format published by Shueisha beginning in 2008 As sh hen edition is B 5 size 176 mm 250 mm 6 9 in 9 8 in larger than aka nzen ban and similarly reproduces chapter covers and colour pages while also including a variety of bonus features such as posters and interviews The majority of s sh hen releases are for popular manga with ongoing serialization s They contain far more pages than a standard tank bon and feature more chapters in fewer volumes Naruto Part I was originally published in 27 tank bon volumes but was completed in just eights sh hen volumes 9 A wide ban or wai do ban lit wide edition edition is larger A 5 size than a regular tank bon Many manga particularly seinen and josei manga are published in wide ban editions after magazine serial is ation and are never released in the tank bon format that is common in sh nen manga and sh jo manga When a series originally published in tank bon format is re released in wide ban format each volume will contain more pages than in the original edition and therefore the series will consist of
