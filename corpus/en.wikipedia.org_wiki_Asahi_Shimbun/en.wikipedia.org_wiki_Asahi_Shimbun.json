considered a newspaper of record for Japan The Asahi S him bun is one of the five largest newspapers in Japan along with the Yomiuri S him bun the Mainichi S him bun the Nihon Keizai S him bun and Chun ichi S him bun 14 The newspaper's circulation which was 4 57 million for its morning edition and 1 33 million for its evening edition as of July 2021 15 was second behind that of the Yomiuri S him bun By print circulation it is the second largest newspaper in the world behind the Yomiuri though its digital size trails that of many global newspapers including The New York Times 16 Its publisher The Asahi S him bun Company 17 is a media conglomerate with its registered headquarters in Osaka It is a privately held family business with ownership and control remaining with the founding Mura yama and Ueno families According to the Reuters Institute Digital Report 2018 public trust in the Asahi S him bun is the lowest among Japan's major dailies though confidence is declining in all the major newspapers 18 One of Japan's oldest and largest national daily newspapers the Asahi S him bun began publication in Osaka on 25 January 1879 as a small print four page illustrated paper that sold for one sen a hundredth of a yen a copy and had a circulation of approximately 3 000 copies The three founding officers of a staff of twenty were Kimura Noboru company president Mura yama Ry he i j a owner and Tsuda Tei managing editor The company's first premises were at Minami d ri Edo bor i in Osaka On 13 September of the same year Asahi printed its first editorial In 1881 the Asahi adopted an all news format and enlisted Ueno Ri ichi as co owner From 1882 Asahi began to receive financial support from the Government and Mi tsui and hardened the management base Then under the leadership of Ueno whose brother was one of the Mi tsui managers and Mura yama the Asahi began its steady ascent to national prominence On 10 July 1888 the first issue of the Tokyo Asahi S him bun was published from the Tokyo office at Mo tosu kiya ch Ky bash i The first issue was numbered No 1 076 as it was a continuation of three small papers J iy no To moshi bi To moshi bi S him bun and Mesa mash i S him bun 19 On 1 April 1907 the renowned writer Natsume S seki then 41 resigned his teaching positions at Tokyo Imperial University now Tokyo University to join the Tokyo Asahi S him bun This was soon after the publication of his novels Wagah a i wa Neko de Aru I Am a Cat and Botch an which made him the center of literary attention 19 On 1 October 1908 Osaka Asahi S him bun and Tokyo Asahi S him bun were merged into a single unified corporation Asahi S him bun G shi K aisha with a capitalization of approximately 600 000 yen 20 In 1918 because of its critical stance towards Terauchi Masa take's cabinet during the Rice Riots government authorities suppressed an article in the Osaka Asahi leading to a softening of its liberal views and the resignation of many of its staff reporters in protest 21 22 Indeed the newspaper's liberal position led to its vandal iz ation during the February 26 Incident of 1936 as well as repeated attacks from ultra nationalists throughout this period and for that matter throughout its history From the latter half of the 1930 s Asahi ardently supported Prime Minister Fu mi maro Konoe's wartime government called Konoe Shin Taisei or Konoe's New Political Order and criticized capitalism harshly underTake tora Og at a the Editor in Chief of Asahi S him bun Influential editorial writers of Asahi such as Shin tar Ry Hiro o Sass a and Hot sumi

attempted assassination of Prime Minister Hideki T j one of the leaders of T s eih a or Control Group which conflicted with K d hain the Japanese Army On 9 April 1937 the Kamikaze a Mitsubishi aircraft sponsored by the Asahi S him bun company and flown by Masaaki Ii numa arrived in London to the astonishment of the Western world It was the first Japanese built aircraft to fly to Europe On 1 September 1940 the Osaka Asahi S him bun and the Tokyo Asahi S him bun unified their names into the Asahi S him bun On 1 January 1943 the publication of the Asahi S him bun was stopped by the government after the newspaper published a critical essay contributed by Sei g Nakano who was also one of the leading members of the Gen y sha and Og at a's best friend On 27 December 1943 Nagata ka Mura yama j a a son in law of Mura yama Ry he i and the President of Asahi removed Og at a from the Editor in Chief and relegated him to the Vice President to hold absolute power in Asahi On 22 July 1944 Og at a Vice President of Asahi became a Minister without Portfolio and the President of Cabinet Intelligence Agency in Kuni aki Koi so's cabinet On 7 April 1945 Hiroshi Shimomura former Vice President of Asahi became the Minister without Portfolio and the President of Cabinet Intelligence Agency in Kant ar Suzuki's cabinet On 17 August 1945 Og at a became the Minister without Portfolio and the Chief Cabinet Secretary and the President of Cabinet Intelligence Agency in Prince Higashi kuni's cabinet On 5 November 1945 as a way of assuming responsibility for compromising the newspaper's principles during the war the Asahi S him bun's president and senior executives resigned en masse On 21 November 1946 the newspaper adopted the modern kana usage system shin kana zu kai On 30 November 1949 the Asahi S him bun started to publish the serialized cartoon stripS aza e san by Machi ko Hasegawa This was a landmark cartoon in Japan's postwar era Between 1954 and 1971 Asahi S him b unpublished a glossy large format annual in English entitled This is Japan Between April and May 1989 the paper reported that a coral reef near Okinawa was defaced by a man with a Japanese dissolute mind It later turned to be a report in which the reporter himself defaced the coral reef This incident was called j a the Asahi S him bun coral article hoax incident 24 citation needed and the president resigned to take responsibility for it 25 On 26 June 2007 Yoichi Fun abash i was named the third editor in chief of Asahi S him bun Sh ichi Ueno the newspaper's co owner since 1997 died on 29 February 2016 26 While Shin ichi Ha kojima was CEO a partnership with the International Herald Tribune led to the publication of an English language newspaper the International Herald Tribune Asahi S him bun It continued from April 2001 until February 2011 27 It replaced Asahi's previous English language daily the Asahi Evening News In 2010 this partnership was dissolved due to un profitability and the Asahi S him bun now operates the Asia Japan Watch online portal for English readers 27 The Tribune now known as The International New York Times cooperates with Asahi on Aera English a glossy magazine for English learners 28 The Asahi S him bun is considered left leaning 29 30 31 and has been called the intellectual flagship of Japan's political left 32 with a long tradition of reporting on big political scandals more often than its conservative counterparts 33 The paper is considered a newspaper of record in Japan 34 35 36 The Asahi S him bun is critical of right wing Japanese nationalism and shows progressive tendencies in cultural and diplomatic issues but has a neoliberal tendency economically The latter contrasts with Mainichi S him bun's relatively Keynesian economic viewpoint 37 However in general evaluation the Asahi S him bun seems to have a tone representing Japanese social liberals left liberals 3 4 The Asahi has called for the upholding of Japan's postwar Constitution and particularly Article 9 which bars the use of war to resolve disputes The newspaper has also opposed changes in interpretation of the anti war provision including one made in 2014 that allowed the Japan Self Defense Forces to come to the aid of an ally under attack the so called right of collective self defense 38 While the Asahi retracted articles based on the discredited testimony of Seiji Yoshida its editorial position still recognizes the existence of the comfort women as Korean and other women from Japan's conquered territories during World War II who were coerced into prostitution to serve the Japanese military 39 According to the Digital News Report from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism in 2018 the Asahi earned the lowest trust among the five largest newspapers in Japan 5 35 compared to 5 68 of San kei S him bun Further analysis from the institute indicated the low trust against the Asahi is due to high distrust because of strong criticism from political right in Japan 40 41 In August 2014 the newspaper retracted the discredited testimonies of Seiji Yoshida about the forcible recruitment of comfort women that were cited in several articles published by the Asahi and other major Japanese newspapers in the 1980 s and 1990 s The paper drew ire from conservative media who along with A be's government criticized it for damaging Japan's reputation abroad 42 43 some leveraging on this episode to imply that sexual slavery itself was a fabrication The Asahi newspaper reaffirmed in its retracting article that the fact that women were coerced into being sexual partners for Japanese soldiers cannot be erased but also confirmed No official documents were found that directly showed forcible taking away by the military on the Korean Peninsula and Taiwan where the people living there were made ' subjects ' of the Japanese Empire under Japanese colonial rule Prostitution agents were prevalent due to the poverty and patriarchal family system For that reason even if the military was not directly involved it is said it was possible to gather many women through such methods as work related scams and human trafficking 44 45 Following the March 2011 Fukushima Dai ichi nuclear disaster the Asahi and other newspapers faced growing public criticism for adhering too closely to the government narrative during their reporting of the disaster 46 47 In response the Asahi strengthened its investigative reporting unit called the Tokubetsu Ho do bu or Special Reports Section to take a more independent approach to its coverage The section won many awards including the Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association Award in 2012 and again in 2013 48 In May 2014 the section published what it hoped would be its biggest scoop yet a copy of the firsthand account of the disaster given by Masao Yoshida who was the manager of the Fukushima Dai ichi power plant when the triple meltdown occurred the testimony recorded by government investigators had been kept hidden from public view In the testimony Yoshida said that 90 of the plant's employees had left the plant at the height of the crisis despite him having given instructions for them to remain He also testified that he believed his instructions had simply not reached the employees in the chaos of the disaster However controversy erupted over the As a history and particularly the headline which stated Workers Evacuated Violating Plant Manager Orders 49 The newspaper came under intense criticism for slandering the workers by implying that they had fled the plant due to cowardice when many in Japan had come to see Yoshida and plant workers as heroes who had prevented a worse disaster at the plant 50 Japanese journalist Ryu sho Ka dota who have previously interviewed Yoshida and plant workers was one of the first to criticize the Asahi for mis characterizing the evacuation 51 The Asahi at first defended its story demanding that Ka dota's publisher apologize and issue a correction 52 However in August the Yomiuri S him bun San kei S him bun Kyodo News and NHK all acquired the same testimony apparently from the government and used it not to shed light on the disaster but to attack the Asahi 53 54 In mid September facing intense criticism from other media and the government of Prime Minister Shinzo A be for its Fukushima coverage and also its retractions of the comfort women stories the Asahi suddenly announced that the Yoshida story had been mistaken and retracted it The president of the Asahi Tada kaz u Kimura a supporter of the investigative section resigned to take responsibility 55 56 57 The reporters and editors responsible for the story were punished and the Special Reports Section reduced in size with many of its members reassigned elsewhere in the paper Two of the top reporters later quit to found an on profit journalism organization that is one of the first in Japan dedicated to investigative journalism the Waseda Chronicle later renamed to Tokyo Investigative Newsroom Tans a The Asahi's investigative section was told to avoid coverage of the Fukushima disaster and has largely faded from view 49 58 In the evening edition of April 20 1989 an article described how the world's largest Azam i coral in a sea area designated as a natural environment conservation area in Okinawa was damaged with the initial KY scratched on the coral Along with a color photograph of the scratched coral the article lamented the decline in Japanese morals Later investigations by local divers who had doubts about the article proved that the Asahi photographer himself made the scratches to forge a newspaper article Taking responsibility the president at that time To ichiro Hito tsu yana gi was forced to resign 59 This was also known as the KY case On 27 September 1950 a solo interview with a Japanese Communist Party executive in hiding R its u I to was posted Later it was revealed that this was forged by the Asahi reporter in charge The Asahi S him bun Asia Network A AN is a think tank that aims to promote information exchange in Asia and provide opportunities for scholars researchers and journalists to share their ideas on pressing themes in Asia It was established in 1999 60 Their work includes annual international symposia and the publication of research reports 61 In 2003 Gong Ro

available in three major forms as CD ROMs as microfilm and as shu kusatsu ban literally reduced sized print editions Shu kusatsu ban is a technology popularized by Asahi S him bun in the 1930 s as a

ching Library at Harvard University which notably includes advertisements in its index Researchers using other university libraries would probably have to first use the CD ROM index and then look into
