    "transformers_text": "Science fiction often shortened to sci fi or abbreviated SF is the genre of speculative fiction that imagines advanced and futuristic scientific or technological progress The elements of science fiction have evolved over time from space exploration extraterrestrial life time travel and robotics to parallel universes dystopian societies and biological manipulations and most lately to information technology transhumanism and post humanism and environmental challenges Science fiction often specifically explores human responses to the consequences of these types of projected or imagined scientific advances The precise definition of science fiction has long been disputed among authors critics scholars and readers It contains many subgenres including hard science fiction which emphasizes scientific accuracy and soft science fiction which focuses on social sciences Other notable subgenres are cyberpunk which explores the interface between technology and society climate fiction which addresses environmental issues and space opera which emphasizes pure adventure in a universe in which space travel is common Precedents for science fiction are claimed to exist as far back as antiquity Some books written in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment Age were considered early science fantasy stories The modern genre arose primarily in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries when popular writers began looking to technological progress for inspiration and speculation Mary Shelley's Frankenstein written in 1818 is often credited as the first true science fiction novel Jules Verne and H G Wells are pivotal figures in the genre's development In the 20 th century the genre grew during the Golden Age of Science Fiction it expanded with the introduction of space operas dystopian literature and pulp magazines Science fiction has come to influence not only literature but also film television and culture at large Science fiction can criticize present day society and explore alternatives as well as provide entertainment and inspire a sense of wonder The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction edited by John Clute and Peter Nicholls in 1993 contains an extensive discussion of the problem of defining the genre 1 2 further explanation needed American writer and professor of biochemistry Isaac Asimov wrote Science fiction can be defined as that branch of literature which deals with the reaction of human beings to changes in science and technology 3 Science fiction writer Robert A Heinlein wrote A handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read realistic speculation about possible future events based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world past and present and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method 4 American science fiction author and editor Lester del Rey wrote Even the devoted aficionado or fan has a hard time trying to explain what science fiction is and no full satisfactory definition exists because there are no easily delineated limits to science fiction 5 Another definition is provided in The Literature Book by the publisher DK scenarios that are at the time of writing technologically impossible extrapolating from present day science or that deal with some form of speculative science based conceit such as a society on Earth or another planet that has developed in wholly different ways from our own 6 There is a tendency among science fiction enthusiasts to be their own arbiters in deciding what constitutes science fiction 7 David Seed says that it may be more useful to talk about science fiction as the intersection of other more concrete subgenres 8 American science fiction author editor and critic Damon Knight summed up the difficulty saying Science fiction is what we point to when we say it 9 American magazine editor science fiction writer and literary agent Forrest J Ackerman has been credited with first using the term sci fi

popular culture writers and fans in the field came to associate the term with low quality pulp science fiction and with low budget low tech B movies 12 13 14 By the 1970 s critics in the field such as Damon Knight and Terry Carr were using sci fi to distinguish hack work from serious science fiction 15 Australian literary scholar and critic Peter Nicholls writes that SF or sf is the preferred abbreviation within the community of sf writers and readers 16 Robert Heinlein found the term science fiction insufficient to describe certain types of works in this genre and he suggested that the term speculative fiction be used instead for works that are more serious or thoughtful 17 Some scholars assert that science fiction had its beginnings in ancient times when the distinction between myth and fact was blurred 18 Written in the 2 nd century CE by the satirist Lucian the novel A True Story contains many themes and tropes that are characteristic of modern science fiction including

aired through Amazon Prime Video Science fiction's rapid increase in popularity during the first half of the 20 th century was closely tied to public respect for science during that era as well as the rapid pace of technological innovation and new inventions 181 Science fiction has often predicted scientific and technological progress 182 183 Some works imagine that this progress will tend to improve human life and society for instance the stories of Arthur C Clarke and Star Trek 184 Other works such asH G Wells's The Time Machine and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World warn of possible negative consequences 185 186 In 2001 the National Science Foundation conducted a survey of Public Attitudes and Public Understanding Science Fiction and Pseudoscience 187 The survey found that people

civilizations 187 188 Carl Sagan wrote that Many scientists deeply involved in the exploration of the solar system myself among them were first turned in that direction by science fiction 189 Science fiction has predicted several existing inventions such as the atomic bomb 190 robots 191 and bora zon 192 In the 2020 TV series Away astronauts use a Mars rover called InSight to listen for a landing

future social relationships with the other Science fiction offers a medium for and a representation of alter it y and differences in social identity 194 Brian Al diss described science fiction as cultural wallpaper 195 This broad influence can be seen in the trend for writers to use science fiction as a tool for advocacy and generating cultural insights as well as for educators who teach across a range of academic disciplines beyond the natural sciences 196 Scholar and science fiction critic George Edgar S lus ser said that science fiction is the one real international literary form we have today and as such has branched out to visual media interactive media and on to whatever new media the world will invent in the 21 st century Crossover issues between the sciences and the humanities are crucial for the century to come 197 Science fiction has sometimes been used as a means of social protest George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty Four 1949 is an important work of dystopian science fiction 198 199 The novel is often invoked in protests against governments and leaders who are seen as totalitarian 200 201 James Cameron's film Avatar 2009 was intended as a protest against imperialism specifically the European colonization of the Americas 202 Science fiction in Latin America and Spain explores the concept of authoritarianism 203 Robots artificial humans human clones intelligent computers and their possible conflicts with human society have all been major themes of science fiction since the publication of Shelly's novel Frankenstein or earlier Some critics have seen this tendency as reflecting authors ' concerns over the social alienation seen in modern society 204 Feminist science fiction poses questions about social issues such as how society constructs gender roles the role reproduction plays in defining gender and the inequitable political or personal power of one gender over others Some works have illustrated these themes using utopias in which gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist or dystopia s in which gender inequalities are intensified thus asserting a need for feminist work to continue 205 206 Climate fiction or cli fi deals with issues of climate change and global warming 207 208 University courses on literature and environmental issues may include climate change fiction in their syllabi 209 and these issues are often discussed by other media beyond science fiction fandom 210 Libertarian science fiction focuses on the politics and social order implied by right libertarian philosophies with an emphasis on individualism and private property and in some cases anti statism 211 Robert A Heinlein is one of the most popular authors of this subgenre including his novels The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Stranger in a Strange Land 212 Science fiction comedy often satirizes and criticizes present day society and it sometimes makes fun of the conventions and clich s of more serious science fiction 213 214 Science fiction is often said to inspire a sense of wonder Science fiction editor publisher and critic David Hartwell wrote that Science fiction's appeal lies in combination of the rational the believable with the miraculous It is an appeal to the sense of wonder 215 Carl Sagan wrote about growing up with science fiction 189 One of the great benefits of science fiction is that it can convey bits and pieces hints and phrases of knowledge unknown or inaccessible to the reader works you ponder over as the water is running out of the bathtub or as you walk through the woods in an early winter snowfall In 1967 Isaac Asimov commented on changes occurring in the science fiction community 216 And because today's real life so resembles day before yesterday's fantasy the old time fans are restless Deep within whether they admit it or not is a feeling of disappointment and even outrage that the outer world has invaded their private domain They feel the loss of a ' sense of wonder ' because what was once truly confined to ' wonder ' has now become prosaic and mundane The field of science fiction studies involves the critical assessment interpretation and discussion of science fiction literature film TV shows new media fandom and fan fiction 217 Science fiction scholars study the genre to better understand it and its relationship to science technology politics other genres and culture at large 218 Science fiction studies began around the turn of the 20 th century but it was not until later that science fiction studies solidified as a discipline with the publication of the academic journals Extrapolation 1959 Foundation The International Review of Science Fiction 1972 and Science Fiction Studies 1973 219 220 and the establishment of the oldest organizations devoted to the study of science fiction in 1970 the Science Fiction Research Association and the Science Fiction Foundation 221 222 The field has grown considerably since the 1970 s with the establishment of more journals organizations and conferences as well as science fiction degree granting programs such as those offered by the University of Liverpool 223 Science fiction has historically been subdivided into hard and soft categories with the division centering on the feasibility of the science 224 However this distinction has come under increased scrutiny in the 21 st century Some authors such a sTade Thompson and Jeff Van der Meer have observed that stories focusing explicitly on physics astronomy mathematics and engineering tend to be considered hard science fiction while stories focusing on botany mycology zoology and the social sciences tend to be considered soft science fiction regardless of the relative rigor of the science 225 Max Gladstone defined hard science fiction as stories where the math works but he pointed out that this definition identifies stories that often seem weirdly dated as scientific paradigms shift over time 226 Michael Swanwick dismissed the traditional definition of hard science fiction altogether instead stating that it was defined by characters striving to solve problems in the right way with determination a touch of stoicism and the consciousness that the universe is not on his or her side 225 Ursula K Le Guin also criticized the traditional contrast between hard and soft science fiction The ' hard ' science fiction writers dismiss everything except well physics astronomy and maybe chemistry Biology sociology anthropology that's not science to them that's soft stuff They're not that interested in what human beings do really But I am I draw on the social sciences a great deal 227 Many critics remain skeptical of the literary value of science fiction and other forms of genre fiction though some mainstream authors have written works claimed by opponents to be science fiction Mary Shelley wrote a number of scientific romance novels in the Gothic literature tradition including Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus 1818 229 Kurt Vonnegut was a respected American author whose works have been argued by some to contain science fiction premises or themes 230 231 Other science fiction authors whose works are widely considered to be serious literature include Ray Bradbury especially Fahrenheit 451 and The Martian Chronicles 232 Arthur C Clarke especially Childhood's End 233 234 and Paul Myron Anthony Line barge r using the pseudonym Cor dwaine r Smith 235 Doris Lessing who was later awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature wrote a series of five science fiction novels Canopus in Argos Archives 1979 1983 these novels depict the efforts of more advanced species and civilizations to influence less advanced ones including humans on Earth 236 237 238 239 David Barnett has indicated that some novels use recognizable science fiction tropes but they are not classified by their authors and publishers as science fiction such novels include The Road 2006 by Cor mac McCarthy Cloud Atlas 2004 by David Mitchell The Gone Away World 2008 by Nick Hark away The Stone Gods 2007 by Jeanette Winters on and Oryx and C rake 2003 by Margaret Atwood 240 Atwood in particular argued against categorizing works such as the Handmaid's Tale as science fiction instead she labeled this novel Oryx and C rake and The Testaments as speculative fiction 241 and she criticized science fiction as talking squids in outer space 242 In his book The Western Canon literary critic Harold Bloom includes the novels Brave New World Stanis aw Lem's Solaris Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle and The Left Hand of Darkness as culturally and aesthetically significant works of Western literature though Lem actively spurned the label science fiction 243 In her 1976 essay Science Fiction and Mrs Brown Ursula K Le Guin was asked Can a science fiction writer write a novel She answered that I believe that all novels deal with character The great novelists have brought us to see whatever they wish us to see through some character Otherwise they would not be novelists but poets historians or pamphleteers 244 Orson Scott Card is best known for his 1985 science fiction novel Ender's Game he has postulated that in science fiction the message and intellectual significance of the work are contained within the story itself therefore the genre can omit accepted literary devices and techniques that he characterized as gimmicks or literary games 245 246 In 1998 Jonathan Le them wrote an essay titled Close Encounters The Squandered Promise of Science Fiction in the Village Voice In this essay he recalled the time in 1973 when Thomas Pynchon's novel Gravity's Rainbow was nominated for the Nebula Award and was passed over in favor of Arthur C Clarke's novel Rendezvous with Rama Le them suggests that this point stands as a hidden tombstone marking the death of the hope that SF was about to merge with the mainstream 247 In the same year science fiction author and physicist Gregory Benford wrote that SF is perhaps the defining genre of the twentieth century although its conquering armies are still camped outside the Rome of the literary citadels 248 Science fiction has been written by authors from diverse cultural and geographical backgrounds Among submissions to the science fiction publisher Tor Books men account for 78 and women account for 22 according to 2013 statistics from the publisher 249 A controversy about voting slates for the 2015 Hugo Awards highlighted a tension in the science fiction community between two things a trend toward increasingly diverse works and authors being honored by awards and a reaction by groups of authors and fans who preferred more traditional science fiction 250 Among the most significant and well known awards for science fiction are the Hugo Award for literature presented by the World Science Fiction Society at Worldcon and voted on by fans 251 the Nebula Award for literature presented by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America and voted on by the community of authors 252 the John W Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel presented by a jury of writers 253 and the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award

organize reader polls notably the Locus Award 260 Conventions often abbreviated by fans as cons such as Comic con are held in cities around the world these cater to a local regional national or international membership 261 50 262 General interest conventions cover all aspects of science fiction while others focus on a particular interest such as media fandom or fil k music 263 264 Most science fiction conventions are organized by volunteers in non profit groups though most media oriented events are organized by commercial promoters 265 Science fiction fandom emerged from the letters column in Amazing Stories magazine Fans began writing letters to each other and then assembling their comments in informal publications that became known as fanzines 266 Once in regular communication these fans wanted to meet in person so they organized local clubs 266 267 During the 1930 s the first science fiction conventions gathered fans from a larger area 267 The earliest organized online
