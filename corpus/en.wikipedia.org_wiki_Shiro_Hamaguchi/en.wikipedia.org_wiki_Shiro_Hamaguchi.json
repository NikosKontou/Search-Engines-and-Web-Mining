He is best known for composing music to the anime franchises Girls und Panzer , One Piece , and Oh My Goddess! and arranging/orchestrating music in the Final Fantasy series. He frequently collaborates with fellow composers Kohei Tanaka and Akifumi Tada on anime scores.\n\nBorn in Fukuoka , Japan, Shiro Hamaguchi graduated with a music degree from Tokyo University of the Arts , where he befriended fellow video game musician Masashi Hamauzu . After graduation, he was hired as a department project manager at Victor Entertainment from 1994 to 1996. In 1996, he joined the anime and video game music production company Imagine, where he worked alongside famed composers Hayato Matsuo , Kohei Tanaka , and Kow Otani . [ 1 ] His debut role was the anime series Violinist of Hameln (1996), where he arranged Tanaka's works. His music impressed Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu , who chose Hamaguchi as the arranger for the Final Fantasy VII Reunion Tracks album.

[ 1 ]\n\nHamaguchi scored the pirate-based anime One Piece in 1999 with Tanaka, later returning to compose four of its movies. He also worked as an arranger for the Sakura Wars series. The success of his Final Fantasy VII arrangements led Uematsu to hire him to orchestrate four pieces for the 1999 title Final Fantasy VIII , including the opening theme \"Liberi Fatali\" and the theme song \" Eyes on Me \". These pieces and nine new arrangements appeared in the orchestral album Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec Final Fantasy VIII .

My Goddess: The Movie and the 2001 anime series Final Fantasy: Unlimited , which also featured compositions by Tada.\n\nFor Final Fantasy X , he orchestrated the ending theme and the two versions of the theme song \" Suteki da ne \". He also produced the arrangements for the 2002 concert 20020220 Music from Final Fantasy , the first Final Fantasy concert since 1989. [ 1 ] It mixed his older arrangements with new ones such as \"Vamo' Alla Flamenco\", \"Theme of Love\", \"Tina\", \"Dear Friends\", \"Final Fantasy\", and an eight-minute medley of music from Final Fantasy I , II , and III . [ 7 ] The concert and its CD release set a precedent for many future concerts. [ 1 ] Also in 2002, Hamaguchi scored the anime series Kiddy Grade . His contribution to Final Fantasy XI (2003) was arranging the opening theme. [ 8 ] He also orchestrated three themes for Unlimited Saga on behalf of his university friend Hamauzu. [ 9 ]\n\nAt the end of 2003, Hamaguchi produced the Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII . [ 10 ] He also made new arrangements of \"Opening ~ Bombing Mission\", \"To Zanarkand\", \"Ronfaure\", \"You're Not Alone\", and \"Opera 'Maria and Draco'\" for the concert series Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy in 2004. The concert also featured his arrangement of \"Cloud Smiles\" from the 2005 film Final Fantasy VII Advent Children ; [ 11 ] the remaining contributions to the film by Hamaguchi were old orchestral and piano arrangements. [ 12 ] A handful of Hamaguchi's orchestral arrangements were added to Tour de Japon's American successor Dear Friends - Music from Final Fantasy , which made its debut in May 2004 in Los Angeles. [ 13 ] His arrangements have also been performed at the events More Friends: Music from Final Fantasy , Voices - Music from Final Fantasy , and Play! A Video Game Symphony . [ 1 ]\n\nIn 2005, Hamaguchi scored the anime series Oh! My Goddess and contributed arrangements to the third Symphonic Game Music Concert . [ 14 ] The same year, Hamaguchi decided to enroll at the Berklee College of Music in a one-year jazz composition course to further his opportunities as an anime composer. He has since scored One Piece Movie: The Desert Princess and the Pirates: Adventures in Alabasta , Big Windup! , Ah! My Goddess: Fighting Wings , and Rosario + Vampire .
