    "transformers_text": "Stone Ocean ( Japanese : ストーンオーシャン , Hepburn : Sutōn Ōshan ) is the sixth main story arc of the Japanese manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure , written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki . Set near Port St. Lucie, Florida in 2011, the story follows Jotaro Kujo 's estranged daughter Jolyne Cujoh as she serves a 15-year sentence at Green Dolphin Street Prison. When her father's Stand ability and memories are stolen by a follower of Dio , Jolyne takes it upon herself to save her father, break out of prison, and put an end to the thief's grand machinations.\n\nIt was serialized in Shueisha 's Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 7, 1999, to April 8, 2003, [ a ] and was collected into 17 tankōbon volumes. In its original publication, it was known as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 6 Jolyne Cujoh: Stone Ocean . ( ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 第6部 空条徐倫 ―『 石作りの海 』 , JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken Dai Roku Bu Kūjō Jorīn: Sutōn Ōshan ) . It was preceded by Golden Wind and followed by Steel Ball Run . Viz Media digitally released the manga in English through its Shonen Jump service from January 2022 to December 2024, and released the series in nine hardcover volumes from November 2023 to March 2025. [ 5 ] [ 1 ] [ 6 ]\n\nA 38-episode anime adaptation, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean , was released on Netflix from December 2021 to December 2022.\n\nJotaro Kujo 's daughter, Jolyne Cujoh , is convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 15 years in Green Dolphin Street Prison, unknowingly taking the fall for her boyfriend. Prior to her incarceration, Jolyne pricks her finger on a pendant given to her by her estranged father, which is revealed to contain a fragment of a Stand-bestowing Arrow . This causes Jolyne to manifest her Stand, Stone Free, before being visited by Jotaro, who attempts to break his daughter out while revealing that she was framed by a follower of Dio , but it is revealed to be a trap set for Jotaro as a Stand named Whitesnake extracts Jotaro's memories and Star Platinum in the form of two discs , leaving him in a coma. Jolyne realizes the extent of her father's love for her and resolves to recover his discs from Whitesnake's user. She is joined by Emporio Alniño, a boy born in prison after his mother was murdered by Whitesnake; Ermes Costello, who entered prison seeking revenge for her sister’s death; and Foo Fighters, a sentient plankton colony created by Whitesnake to protect his stolen Stand discs, which later inhabits the corpse of a dead inmate. They are soon joined by two inmates: a weather-controlling amnesiac, named Weather Report, and Narciso Anasui, who has an unrequited love for Jolyne.\n\nWhitesnake's user is eventually revealed to be a prison chaplain named Enrico Pucci. Pucci sought Jotaro's memories to learn the details of Dio's written plan to establish heaven on Earth, which Jotaro had destroyed twenty-two years earlier after killing Dio . After retrieving Jotaro's Stand disc and sending it to the Speedwagon Foundation, Jolyne discovers that Whitesnake has used a subordinate to revive one of Dio's bones, which eventually absorbs the souls of several prisoners and forms a homunculus named the Green Baby. Jolyne's group seizes the Green Baby as bait for Whitesnake's user, but Foo Fighters and Anasui are mortally wounded in the ensuing battle, with Foo Fighters using the last of her strength to save Anasui's life and retrieve Jotaro's memory disc. Pucci successfully fuses with the Green Baby and leaves the prison for Cape Canaveral , where the new moon is expected to bring about the heaven Pucci seeks.\n\nJolyne and her allies escape from prison to pursue Pucci to Orlando, Florida , arranging to give Jotaro's memory disc to the Speedwagon Foundation to revive him while dealing with Pucci's final subordinates, three illegitimate sons of Dio. Weather Report eventually regains his own memory disc and remembers his tragic past as Wes Bluemarine, Pucci's long-lost twin brother. Weather Report unleashes his ability's full extent on Orlando before dying in a confrontation with Pucci, using his final moments to extract his Stand disc for his allies to use. As Pucci reaches Kennedy Space Center , Whitesnake undergoes an evolution into the gravity-manipulating C-Moon and overpowers Jolyne's group. Though Jotaro arrives in time to save his daughter, Pucci realizes that he can use C-Moon to replicate the new moon's gravity, allowing him to complete his Stand's evolution into Made in Heaven, which gives him superhuman speed and exponentially accelerates time (except for living beings). The group makes a desperate stand against Pucci, but most of the group is soon killed. Jolyne sacrifices herself to allow Emporio to escape as the sole survivor.\n\nPucci's Stand accelerates time until a new cycle of time occurs, where people have subconscious precognition of their fate . Emporio awakens to find himself back at the Green Dolphin Street Prison. Pucci attempts to kill Emporio to tie up loose ends, only to inadvertently insert Weather Report's Stand disc into the child's head, changing his fate. Pucci reactivates Made in Heaven in order to counter Weather Report, but Emporio uses Weather Report to increase the concentration of the surrounding oxygen to a lethal amount . Poisoned, paralyzed, and unable to deactivate Made in Heaven's ability, Pucci pleads with Emporio to spare him until he can make Made in Heaven's effect permanent. Emporio refuses and declares that fate follows the path of justice as Weather Report obliterates Pucci's head into the floor.\n\nFollowing the undoing of Made in Heaven's effect, erasing Pucci and his universe from existence, Emporio finds himself at a gas station near Green Dolphin Street Prison where he encounters a hitchhiker named Eldis who bears an uncanny resemblance to Ermes. As it begins to rain, the two are offered a ride by a couple named Irene and Anakiss, resembling Jolyne and Anasui, who are on their way to meet Irene's father for his marital blessing. Emporio, recognizing the reincarnations of his former friends, tearfully reintroduces himself to Irene. The group departs in Anakiss's car, picking up another hitchhiker resembling Weather Report before driving off in the rain.\n\nThe anime adaptation of Stone Ocean was personally announced by series creator Hirohiko Araki on the \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure the Animation Special Event: JOESTAR Inherited Soul\" live stream in April 2021. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] The first twelve episodes premiered on Netflix worldwide on December 1, 2021; episodes 13–24 were released on September 1, 2022, [ 45 ] and episodes 25–38 were released on December 1, 2022. [ 46 ]\n\nFujiko no Kimyō na Shoseijutsu: Whitesnake no Gosan ( フジコの奇妙な処世術 -ホワイトスネイクの誤算- ; \"Fujiko's Bizarre Wisdom: Whitesnake's Miscalculation\") , a one-shot spin-off manga by Shō Aimoto, the creator of Kemono Jihen , was published by Shueisha in their seinen manga magazine Ultra Jump on December 18, 2021. [ 47 ]\n\nKono Manga ga Sugoi! recommended the series, and called Jolyne a distinctive character within the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure franchise.
