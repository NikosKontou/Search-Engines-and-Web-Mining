2015 almost 34 million French people watched this channel which is nearly 9 million daily in average As a rolling news channel BF MTV has been criticized for acc el erat ing reality and cr eat ing pressure for instant solutions as well as being conf latin g what it means to be popular and populist due to its pursuit of audiences Thus other media institutions have insinuated that BF MTV has furthered the cause of Marine Le Pen the head of the nationalist Front national political party For example BF MTV star interviewer Jean Jacques Bou rd in has been ridiculed for rejoicing at the prospect of a President Le Pen such insinuations tend to arouse fury in the BF MTV newsroom In March 2014 French media regulator Conseil sup rieur de l ' audio vis uel CSA examined BF MTV's distribution of airtime for election candidates stating that the channel gave UMP and Socialist Party candidates limited access while allowing the Front National persistent over representation 3 Daniel Schneidermann a media commentator writing for the left wing Lib ration thinks that BF MTV may not set out to be right wing but it ends up that way de facto claiming that BF MTV over cover s her because they need good ratings and Le Pen always gets a good audience Similarly Schneidermann notes that they prioritize coverage of sensational issues such as crime stories to the detriment of social stories Indeed Bou rd in and another TV host Christophe Hon de latte have been described as a duo of shock 4 For example Hon de latte revealed that his pay is tied to the size of the audience he attracts 5 The French media regulator Conseil sup rieur de l ' audio vis uel CSA has stated in 2014 that BF MTV allowed the Front National persistent over representation during the 2014 French
