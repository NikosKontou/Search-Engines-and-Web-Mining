satellite and in most of the world via its website on YouTube and on various mobile devices and digital media players The network began broadcasting on New Year's Day 1993 and covers world news from a European perspective Euro news is currently majority owned by Al pac Capital In 1992 following the Persian Gulf War during which CNN's position as the preeminent source of 24 hour news programming was cemented the European Broadcasting Union EBU proposed a channel to present information from a counterpart European perspective 2 Euro news was founded by a consortium of ten EBU members national public broadcasters titled SO CE MIE French Soci t d it rice de la cha ne europ enne multi ling ue d ' information Euro news 3 The Swiss public broadcasterS RG SSR was admitted later as a non founding member The BBC and German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF opted not to join 4 5 The French city of Lyon was chosen to host the broadcaster's headquarters out of a variety of candidates also including Munich Bologna and Valencia 5 At launch language services were provided via sound multiplex 6 The inaugural Euro news broadcast was on 1 January 1993 from cully Lyon In 1996 an additional broadcast studio was set up in London In late 1997 the British news broadcaster IT N purchased a 49 share of Euro news for 5 1 million from Alca tel Lucent 7 IT N supplied the content of the channel along with the remaining shareholders A part time Arabic language service was briefly operated from April 1997 with a two year grant from the European Commission comprising eight journalists and freelancers After the tender expired it ceased broadcasting on 15 April 1999 8 In 1999 the broadcast switched from solely analogue to mainly digital transmission The same year a Portuguese audio track was added In 2001 the All Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company VG TR K acquired a 1 8 stake in SO CE MIE A Russian language service was launched later in the year 9 In April 2003 IT N sold its stake in Euro news as part of its drive to streamline operations and focus on news gathering rather than channel management 10 11 On 6 February 2006 Ukrainian public broadcaster Nats ional na Telekom p any a Ukr a ny purchased a one percent interest in SO CE MIE 12 In 2007 Euro news won the European Commission's tender for an Arabic language news channel with a service agreement being signed on 6 December A new Arabic service would eventually be launched in July 2008 13 On 27 May 2008 Spanish public broadcaster RTVE decided to withdraw from the Euro news consortium citing legal requirements to maintain low debt levels through careful spending and prior it is ation of its existing international channel as a factor influencing its decision to leave 14 In February 2009 Turkish public broadcaster TR T purchased 15 70 of the channel's shares and became the fourth main partner after France T l visions 23 93 RAI 21 54 and VG TR K 16 94 while also joining its supervisory board 15 New language services included Turkish in January 2010 Persian in October 2010 and Ukrainian in August 2011 16 17 A short lived Polish service was launched in mid 2011 to mark Poland's assumption of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union although only some selected evening broadcasts were translated It was discontinued in January 2012 18 The service was briefly reestablished in September 2012 in the form of a 15 minute programme broadcast on private television channel T TV three times a day during weekdays The Polish service survived in this form until the end of 2013 19 The channel began broadcasting in widescreen in January 2011 in concert with France 24 17 In February 2015 the channel's executive board approved a bid by Media Globe Networks owned by Egyptian telecom magnate Naguib Saw iris to acquire a 53 controlling stake in the media outlet The deal raised questions over Euro news's future editorial posture and independence 20 21 22 On 13 March 2015 it was announced that Inter Media Group owned by pro Russian Ukrainian oligarch D my tro Fir t ash had purchased the Ukrainian service In response the government of Ukraine citing suspected bias revoked its broadcasting license and dropped its funding 23 Fir t ash later abandoned the project resulting in the department shutting down and leaving 17 journalists redundant The Russian service which was financed by the government of Russia refused to provide jobs to the journalists violating French labour legislation The management explained that not hiring any Ukrainian journalists was a specific instruction from VG TR K 24 25 In October 2015 Euro news moved to a new headquarters complex in the Lyon district of La Confluence fr designed by Paris based architecture firm Jakob MacFarlane and covering a floor area of 10 000 m 2 21 2 acres 26 27 The decision to move was announced in 2011 prior to the Media Globe Networks purchase 28 In 2016 Euro news S A was co owned by Media Globe Networks regional authorities Lyon Metropolis Rh ne Auvergne Rh ne Alpes and the following broadcasters 29 In November 2016 the channel's executive board was in talks with NBC Universal the parent company of NBC News for a strategic partnership NBC U would acquire 15 to 30 ownership of the Euro news network would contribute to Euro news content and facilitate NBC News ' expanded operations in Europe 30 After successful negotiations with the European Commission who feared that the partnership would result in an American iz ation of Euro news the NBC Universal News Group finalised its purchase of a 25 stake in Euro news in February 2017 for 25 million 30 million NBC News president Deborah Turn ess was appointed to head up international operations and incumbent Euro news CEO Michael Peters who had led it since 2004 became CEO of the new partnership Both reported directly to NBC News chairman Andrew Lack The resulting partnership became known as Euro news NBC 31 32 Although Naguib Saw iris and NBC News had the largest stakes in Euro news editorial control by SO CE MIE members was assured with the broadcasters having seven slots in the editorial board as opposed to Saw iris ' company which has three slots and NBC News which only has one there by reducing rumors of an American iz ation of Euro news ' values Editorial control is fully handled by Euro news ' teams with NBC only focusing on planning and coordinating tasks 33 After the formation of the partnership video reports from NBC News ' properties and correspondents began to appear frequently on the TV channel and reports from NBC News com began to be distributed on its digital platforms On 9 May 2017 Euro news began a process of splitting its services into twelve separate editions for each language of which nine have a linear TV channel retaining their respective voiceover but now including the on screen ticker and most lower thirds in the local language The g local strategy allows the language editorial teams to personalize the content and presentation of their channel not only by sharing own produced content with other languages but by producing content that is relevant to local audiences and allowing local reporters and presenters to appear on camera in all its language editions The splitting process finished on 24 May 2017 34 The language split resulted in the discontinuation of satellite distribution for the newly created German Spanish Portuguese and Turkish channels now being only available via fiber optic IP uplink 34 The discontinuation of the German language channel on satellite in particular generated outcry from many German satellite TV owners resulting in its restoration on the Astra 1 L satellite on 25 July 2017 via an unencrypted SD feed sitting alongside the French language channel 35 Additionally the Arabic and Persian language editions were relegated to an online only distribution on Euro news ' website and apps and major social media networks with TV broadcasting being discontinued 36 This later also applied for the Turkish language edition following discontinued support from TR T who wanted to prior it is e its own international news channel TR T World 37 36 Furthermore the Ukrainian edition was discontinued outright due to lack of funding from the Ukrainian government as well as due to the controversy surrounding the ownership of its broadcasting licence 38 Finally the Euro news channel in English would become known as the World edition and distribution to premises in the American continent via fiber optic IP uplink was set to begin later in 2018 34 These changes caused the elimination of 43 staff positions mainly from the Ukrainian edition causing major layoffs and leading to production staff having more flexible roles 39 In 2018 Euro news ' English language channel began to gradually revamp its programming schedule with the roll out of a new slate of presenter led programming to complement its already existing shows a move that was reported earlier in the year after the success of its presenter led special reports and weekly programming introduced in recent years 40 Alongside conventional rolling news shows with newsreader s debate programming talk shows and new presenter led long form shows began to be offered during the weekly schedule and throughout programs Euro news reporters from different nationalities will be offering context on stories close to their respective home nationalities 41 The roll out began on 22 May when Euro news debuted the first of these new shows Good Morning Europe a five hour morning show which airs every weekday morning from 7 am It was first anchored by former RT correspondent and TVB Pearl news presenter Tes a Ar cilla who anchored it on a temporary basis Some weeks later former France 24 presenter Belle Donati began presenting the show alternating with Ar cilla after she moved to Brussels in September she became the main anchor of the slot Two months later on 17 July Euro news debuted a six hour breaking news show Euro news Now anchored by To kun bo Salak o covering the day side and afternoon slots On 3 September the new evening program lineup was launched starting with a politics focused show Raw Politics hosted from Brussels by Tes a Ar cilla and featuring former Sky News reporter Darren Mc Caf frey It also spawned a weekly spin off Raw Politics Your Call a phone in show which featured European Parliament members answering viewers ' questions by phone or social media The show was dropped over a year later in October 2019 due to low viewership with its content being integrated into the rolling news programming Two weeks after the launch of Raw Politics on 17 September the full roll out was completed with the introduction of a 5 hour evening rolling news show Euro news Tonight initially presented by former Sky News and BBC News presenterS am Naz and later by Euro news veteran Isabelle Kumar who has worked with the channel since 2003 42 43 The traditional pre produced blocks of video content still remained on some late nights and weekends Most overnights by this point repeated the previous day's edition either full or half length of Euro news Now New weekly programming was also produced including the weekly interview series Uncut which feature conversations from political leaders and news makers worldwide with minimum to no editing The first episodes featured Franco German politician Daniel Cohn Bend it interviewing former UKIP leader Nigel Farage and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair about Br exit Additionally a new social media unit was created with journalists with a background on digital news verification leading it The newly created team helped to produce The Cube a social media segment during rolling news shows focusing on analysis on treatment and reactions about news headlines on social media with special attention at the major stories of the day No Comment a long standing element of Euro news ' programming remains on the channels ' schedule and it was gradually integrated into the rolling news shows on the English language channel 42 Additionally a major investment in mobile reporting via iPhone devices helped Euro news gain a major scoop becoming the only TV news outlet worldwide to broadcast live coverage from the MV Aquarius with Paris correspondent Anne lise Borges formerly with France 24 on assignment Borges broadcast live for 10 days as the Italian government denied the Aquarius access to Italian ports The coverage made headlines on many news outlets worldwide and helped Euro news augment its credibility and its audience 42 The new Euro news also hired new correspondents in London Berlin Moscow Rome Madrid and Washington D C and gained access to NBC News ' large network of correspondents worldwide As of September 2018 the other language editions were unaffected with the pre produced blocks of video content remaining at all times Programming day parts were later named with proper translations of the existing day part programming of the World edition i e the evening day part being named Euro news am A bend Euro news No it e Euro news So ir There were plans to introduce presenter led programming during the morning slots on these other channels eventually the evening day part in most of the language specific channels became presenter led by late 2018 all of these editions were pre recorded and pre produced before broadcast and eventually looped through the night 40 By 2019 several of the newly launched anchored programmes including Raw Politics had been cancelled and the network began facing a liquidity crisis with its estimated value having fallen to 3 7 million from its previous worth of 67 million in 2015 according to the French magazine Capital 44 32 On 20 April 2020 it was reported that NBC Universal had sold its stake in Euro news to Media Globe Networks for 3 million giving the latter an overall majority share of 88 NBC Universal's parent company Comcast had recently acquired pan European satellite service Sky Group and was prioritizing a collaboration between NBC News and Sky News on a new international news channel The proposed service was scrapped in August during the C OVID 19 pandemic in Europe with the project no longer considered commercially viable 45 46 32 In November 2020 French newspaper Lib ration stated in an online article that Euro news had been producing an increasing amount of magazine content focusing on Dubai and sponsored by the Dubai tourism board which had allegedly caused staff discontent 47 Segments dedicated to Dubai were found to only have a brief sentence in small print indicating their sponsorship which a Euro news spokesperson argued met French broadcast standards rather than using the logo of the relevant institution as with other sponsored content 47 The article noted that this was likely a result of continued private di vestment leading to influence from the International Media Investments IMI corporation owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the ruling royal family of Abu Dhabi which discreetly became a shareholder in 2017 and then signed a memorandum with Euro news the following year 47 The network would later conduct similar partnerships with Media City Qatar and the Saudi Tourism Authority both state owned to produce relevant sponsored segments 48 As part of Euro news ' digital growth post NBC the broadcaster has launched a series of online verticals dedicated to specific areas These include Euro news Green Euro news Travel Euro news Next and Euro news Culture 49 50 51 In December 2021 reports surfaced that Lisbon based Al pac Capital would buy an 88 controlling stake in Euro news from Egyptian telecom s magnate Naguib Saw iris 52 53 54 The sale was met with scrutiny as Al pac is allegedly linked to Prime Minister Viktor Orb n of Hungary through M rio David the father of Al pac Capital's CEO Pedro Vargas David who is a long time associate advisor and friend to Orb n The acquisition was partly financed by funds from the Hungarian state which asserted that the purchase would counter the media's left wing bias According to gne s Ur b n director of the think tank Mer tek Media Monitor Euro news risked being exploited as a pseudo independent media outpost of the government of Hungary where it maintains a semblance of independence but takes a far less critical stance with regard to Hungary and other so called illiberal democracies Euro news CEO Michael Peters and several of the network's employees subsequently affirmed that the new partnership would not encroach on its editorial independence 55 56 57 58 59 The purchase was finalised in July 2022 following approval from the French government 60 61 Guillaume Dubois a former broadcasting director a tLC I took over as CEO in June 2022 prior to the purchase's completion 62 By the end of 2022 weekday news bulletins had gradually phased out all remaining in vision presenting reverting to the traditional voiceover format some cancelled shows were reportedly still cited in programme guides 63 Four veteran shareholders within the network founding public broadcasters France T l visions RT BF and RAI as well as S RG SSR had withdrawn from its capital by September 2022 64 65 As of July 2023 Euro news now lists only four shareholders on its About us page with Al pac Capital's share at 97 6 In early 2023 the channel's on air identity and schedule was refreshed to mark the network's thirtieth anniversary with less emphasis on in vision presenting introduced in 2018 The on screen branding tailored to be optimised for mobile viewing now includes a side strip of tweets sourced from different news outlets 66 63 On 2 March 2023 the network announced it would begin relocating its principal and editorial headquarters to Brussels creating one hundred new positions there including 70 reserved for journalists and eliminating 198 staff positions in Lyon in the process 142 jobs would remain based in Lyon including those of the Russian and Persian language editorial teams In addition the previous headquarters complex in Lyon would be closed and sold 67 68 63 The French National Syndicate of Journalists fr union said the move would lead to Euro news becoming a half empty shell and a weakening of the pluralism of information 69 In October 2024 Dubois was fired from his position as CEO and replaced by former Axel Springer Managing Director Claus St runz with employees raising concerns over St runz's pro Israel and anti immigrant stance on Twitter 70 71 59 At the end of 2024 Euro news relaunched its Polish language website announcing the launch of a local service on 15 January 2025 72 Unlike the previous incarnation the new Polish service is to be a permanent addition as the 18 th language which in turn is to confirm the involvement of well known Polish journalists in the project The launch of the service again coincided with Poland taking over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union 73 On 10 June 2025 Euro news relaunched its Persian language linear television service on online platforms with broadcasting via satellite providers to be offered at a later date 74 On 2 October 2012 Euro news launched Euro news Radio The service was available for download on the App Store and Google Play in addition to being available on Tune In and was designed for viewers for whom watching news is not an option by providing a direct simulcast to the TV channel To

by a holding corporation known as Euro news S A which also holds the broadcasting licence As of July 2023 the Portuguese investment management firm Al pac Capital has a 97 6 stake in Euro news S A 52

87 Initially based in Pointe Noire its website debuted on 4 January 2016 with the Africa news TV channel eventually launching on 20 April broadcasting in English and French 88 In January 2016 Euro news was accused of plagiarism by the Congolese media group Africa News 89 because the Lyon based channel used the name Africa news for its African subsidiary However Africa News in the Democratic Republic of Congo has existed since 2005 and can be found on the Internet Its employees sent letters to DRC authorities and managing director of Euro news Michael Peters to change the related name and to avoid using it for the African subsidiary of Euro news 90 91 89 In 2020 Euro news originally planned to sell Africa news to a group known as Sip roma d but the deal eventually fell through and the two parties entered litigation As a result Africa news would remain under the ownership of its sister channel but its production would move from Pointe Noire to Euro news's headquarters in Lyon by the end of July 2020 with a reduction in costs of at least 30 92 As of 2023 Euro news primarily broadcasts from its headquarters in Lyon but also maintains international bureaux for editorial or marketing

A Minsk based expert assessed that the move deprived Belarusians of an alternative to state run news outlets 109 In May 2016 Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova accused Euro news of disinformation after an online article mistakenly embedded a tweet from a parody account claiming to be foreign minister Sergey L avro v 111 112 Pyotr Fedorov a member of the Euro news supervisory board representing the Russian state broadcaster VG TR K referred to the incident as an unconscious Russo phobia characteristic of English language journalists 113 An October 2016 report broadcast on Russia 1 and produced by correspondent and propagandist Evgeni y Pod dub ny accused Euro news of producing an anti Russian fake about Syria in the context of the Syrian army offensive during the Battle of Aleppo 114 non primary source needed Access to Euro news in Russia including its online services was restricted by Ros kom n adz or in late March 2022 following the Russian invasion of
