an increasingly major part of the Japanese publishing industry 8 By 1995 the manga market in Japan was valued at 586 4 billion US 6 7 billion 9 with annual sales of 1 9 billion manga books and manga magazines also known as manga anthologies in Japan equivalent to 15 issues per person 10 The domestic manga market in Japan remained in the 400 billion range annually from 2014 to 2019 In 2020 as the C OVID 19 pandemic led to increased time spent at home the market rapidly expanded to 612 6 billion Growth continued even after the end of lockdown s reaching a record high of 704 3 billion in 2024 Alongside this rapid expansion the print manga market has continued to shrink as of 2024 digital manga accounts for approximately 500 billion while print manga makes up about 200 billion 11 Manga have also gained a significant worldwide readership 12 13 14 15 Beginning with the late 2010 s manga started massively outselling American comics 16 As of 2021 the top four comics publishers in the world are manga publishers Shueisha Kodansha Kadokawa and Sho gaku kan 17 In 2020 the North American manga market was valued at almost 250 million 18 According to NPD BookS can manga made up 76 of overall comics and graphic novel sales in the US in 2021 19 The fast growth of the North American manga market is attributed to manga's wide availability on digital reading apps book retailer chains such as Barnes Noble and online retailers such as Amazonas well as the increased streaming of anime 20 21 22 Manga represented 38 of the French comics market in 2005 23 This is equivalent to approximately three times that of the United States and was valued at about 460 million 640 million 24 In Europe and the Middle East the market was valued at 250 million in 2012 25 Manga stories are typically printed in black and white due to time constraints artistic reasons as coloring could lessen the impact of the artwork 26 and to keep printing costs low 27 although some full color manga exist e g Colorful In Japan manga are usually serialized in large manga magazines often containing many stories each presented in a single episode to be continued in the next issue A single manga story is almost always longer than a single issue from a Western comic 28 Collected chapters are usually republished in tank bon volumes frequently but not exclusively paperback books 29 A manga artist mangaka in Japanese typically works with a few assistants in a small studio and is associated with a creative editor from a commercial publishing company 30 If a manga series is popular enough it may be animated after or during its run 31 Sometimes manga are based on previous live action or animated films 32 Manga influenced comics among original works exist in other parts of the world particularly in those places that speak Chinese man hua Korean man hwa English O EL manga and French man fra as well as in the nation of Algeria DZ manga 33 34 The word manga comes from the Japanese word 35 katakana hiragana composed of the two kanji man meaning ' whimsical or impromptu ' and ga meaning ' pictures ' 36 37 The same term is the root of the Korean word for comics man hwa and the Chinese word man hua 38 The word first came into common usage in the late 18 th century 39 with the publication of such works as Sant Ky den's picture book Shiji no yuki kai 1798 40 36 and in the early 19 th century with such works as Aikawa Mi nwa's Manga hy aku jo 1814 and the celebrated Hokusai Manga books 1814 1834 41 containing assorted drawings from the sketchbooks of the famous ukiyo e artist Hokusai 42 Rak u ten Kitazawa 1876 1955 first used the word manga in the modern sense 43 In Japanese manga refers to all kinds of cartooning comics and animation Among English speakers manga has the stricter meaning of Japanese comics in parallel to the usage of anime in and outside Japan The term ani manga is used to describe comics produced from animation cels 44 Manga originated from ema kimono scrolls Ch j j in butsu giga dating back to the 12 th century 45 46 During the Edo period 1603 1867 a book of drawings titled Toba Eh on further developed what would later be called manga 45 46 The word itself first came into common usage in 1798 39 with the publication of works such as Sant Ky den's picture book Shiji no yuki kai 1798 40 36 and in the early 19 th century with such works as Aikawa Mi nwa's Manga hy aku jo 1814 and the Hokusai Manga books 1814 1834 42 47 Adam L Kern has suggested that ki by shi picture books from the late 18 th century may have been the world's first comic books These graphical narratives share with modern manga humorous satirical and romantic themes 48 Some works were mass produced as serials using woodblock printing 10 However Eastern comics are generally held separate from the evolution of Western comics Western comic art probably originated in 17 th century Italy 49 Writers on manga history have described two broad and complementary processes shaping modern manga One view represented by other writers such as Frederik L S chod t Kink o I to and Adam L Kern stress continuity of Japanese cultural and aesthetic traditions including pre war Meiji and pre Meiji culture and art 50 The other view emphasizes events occurring during and after the Allied occupation of Japan 1945 1952 and stresses U S cultural influences including U S comics brought to Japan by the G Is and images and themes from U S television film and cartoons especially Disney 51 Regardless of its source an explosion of artistic creativity occurred in the post war period 52 involving manga artists such as Osamu Tezuka Astro Boy and Machi ko Hasegawa S aza e san Astro Boy quickly became and remains immensely popular in Japan and elsewhere 53 and the anime adaptation of S aza e s andrew more viewers than any other anime on Japanese television in 2011 45 Tezuka and Hasegawa both made stylistic innovations In Tezuka's cinema to graphic technique the panels are like a motion picture that reveals details of action bordering on slow motion as well as rapid zooms from distance to close up shots This kind of visual dynamism was widely adopted by later manga artists 54 Hasegawa's focus on daily life and women's experience also came to characterize later sh jo manga 55 Between 1950 and 1969 an increasingly large readership for manga emerged in Japan with the solidification of its two main marketing genres sh nen manga aimed at boys and sh jo manga aimed at girls 56 In 1969 a group of female manga artists later called the Year 24 Group also known as Magnificent 24 s made their sh jo manga debut year 24 comes from the Japanese name for the year 1949 the birth year of many of these artists 57 The group included Moto Hag io Ri yoko Ikeda Yumi ko shima Keik o Take miya andR yoko Yamagishi 29 Thereafter primarily female manga artists would draws h j of or a readership of girls and young women 58 In the following decades 1975 present sh jo manga continued to develop stylistically while simultaneously evolving different but overlapping subgenres 59 Major subgenres include romance superheroine s and Ladies Comics in Japanese red is u redi komi and josei 60 Modern sh jo manga romance features love as a major theme set into emotionally intense narratives of self realization 61 With the superheroine s sh jo manga saw releases such as Pink Hana mori's Mermaid Melody P ichi P ichi Pitch Rei ko Yoshida's Tokyo Mew Mew and Naoko Takeuchi's Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon which became internationally popular in both manga and anime formats 62 Groups or sentai of girls working together have also been popular within this genre Like Lucia Han on and Rina singing together and Sailor Moon Sailor Mercury Sailor Mars Sailor Jupiter and Sailor Venus working together 63 Manga for male readers sub divides according to the age of its intended readership boys up to 18 years old sh nen manga and young men 18 to 30 years old seinen manga 64 as well as by content including action adventure often involving male heroes slapstick humor themes of honor and sometimes explicit sex 65 The Japanese use different kanji for two closely allied meanings of seinen for youth young man and for adult majority the second referring to pornographic manga aimed at grown men and also called seijin ' adult ' manga 66 Sh nen seinen and seijin manga share a number of features in common Boys and young men became some of the earliest readers of manga after World War II From the 1950 s on sh nen manga focused on topics thought to interest the archetypal boy including subjects like robots space travel and heroic action adventure 67 Popular themes include science fiction technology sports and supernatural settings Manga with solitary costumed superheroes like Superman Batman and Spider Man generally did not become as popular 68 The role of girls and women in manga produced for male readers has evolved considerably over time to include those featuring single pretty girls b ish jo 69 such as Bell dandy from Oh My Goddess stories where such girls and women surround the hero as in Negima and Hanau kyo Maid Team or groups of heavily armed female warriors sent b ish jo 70 By the turn of the 21 st century manga achieved worldwide popularity 7 With the relaxation of censorship in Japan in the 1990 s an assortment of explicit sexual material appeared in manga intended for male readers and correspondingly continued into the English translations 71 In 2010 the Tokyo Metropolitan Government considered a bill to restrict minors ' access to such content 72 needs update The g ekiga style of storytelling thematically somber adult oriented and sometimes deeply violent focuses on the day in day out grim realities of life often drawn in a gritty and unvarnished fashion 73 74 G ekiga such asSam pei S hira to's 1959 1962 Chronicles of a Ninja's Military Accomplishments Ninja Bug e ich arose in the late 1950 s and 1960 s partly from left wing student and working class political activism 75 and partly from the aesthetic dissatisfaction of young manga artists like Yoshihiro Tatsu mi with existing manga 76 In Japan manga constituted an annual 40 6 billion yen approximately US 395 million publication industry by 2007 78 In 2006 sales of manga books made up for about 27 of total book sales and sale of manga magazines for 20 of total magazine sales 79 The manga industry has expanded worldwide where distribution companies license and reprint manga into their native languages Market e ers primarily classify manga by the age and gender of the target readership 80 In particular books and magazines sold to boys sh nen and girls sh jo have distinctive cover art and most bookstores place them on different shelves Due to cross readership consumer response is not limited by demographics For example male readers may subscribe to a series intended for female readers and so on Japan has manga caf s or manga kiss a kiss a is an abbreviation of kiss aten At a manga kiss a people drink coffee read manga and sometimes stay overnight The Kyoto International Manga Museum maintains a very large website listing manga published in Japanese 81 E s him bun Nippon chi 1874 published by Kana gaki Rob un and Kaw an a be Kyo sai is credited as the first manga magazine ever made 82 Manga magazines or anthologies manga zasshi usually

strips Manga series can run for many years if they are successful Popular shonen magazines include Weekly Sh nen Jump Weekly Sh nen Magazine and Weekly Sh nen Sunday Popular sh jo manga include Ciao Naka yoshi and Rib on Manga artists sometimes start out with a few one shot manga projects just to try to get their name out If these are successful and receive good reviews they are continued Magazines often have a short life 83 After a series has run for a while publishers often collect the chapters and print them in dedicated book sized volumes called tank bon These can be hardcover or more usually soft cover books and are the equivalent of U S trade paperbacks or graphic novels These volumes often use higher quality paper and are useful to those who want to catch up with a series so they can follow it in the magazines or if they find the cost of the weeklies or monthlies to be prohibitive Deluxe versions have also been printed as readers have gotten older and the need for something special grew Old manga have also been reprinted using somewhat lesser quality paper and sold for 100 yen about 1 U S dollar each to compete with the used book market Kana gaki Rob un and Kaw an a be Ky sai created the first manga magazine in 1874 E shin bun Nippon chi The magazine was heavily influenced by Japan Punch founded in 1862 by Charles Wir g man a British cartoonist E shin bun Nippon chi had a very simple style of drawings and did not become popular with many people E shin bun Nippon chi ended after three issues The magazine Kish o S him bun in 1875 was inspired byE shin

of Japanese children's literature back then Sh nen Se kai had a strong focus on the First Sino Japanese War 85 In 1905 the manga magazine publishing boom started with the Russo Japanese War 86 Tokyo Pakku was created and became a huge hit 87 After Tokyo Pakku in 1905 a female version of Sh nen Se kai was created and named Sh jo Se kai considered the first sh jo magazine 88 Sh nen Pakku was made and is considered the first children's manga magazine The children's demographic was in an early stage of development in the Meiji period Sh nen Pakku was influenced from foreign children's magazines such as Puck which an employee of Jitsu gy no Nihon publisher of the magazine saw and decided to emulate In 1924 Kod omo Pakku was launched as another children's manga magazine after Sh nen Pakku 87 During the boom Po ten derived from the French pot in was published in 1908 All the pages were in full color with influences from Tokyo Pakku and Osaka Puck It is unknown if there were any more issues besides the first one 86 Kod omo Pakku was launched May 1924 by Tokyo sha and featured high quality art by many members of the manga artistry like Takei Takeo Take his a Yume ji and A so Yutaka Some of the manga featured speech balloons where other manga from the previous eras did not use speech balloons and were silent 87 Published from May 1935 to January 1941 Manga no Kuni coincided with the period of the Second Sino Japanese War 1937 1945 Manga no Kuni featured information on becoming a mangaka and on other comics industries around the world Manga no Kuni handed its title to Sash ie

d j in shi sales amounted to 27 73 billion yen US 245 million 78 In 2006 they represented about a tenth of manga books and magazines sales 79 Thanks to the advent of the internet there have been new ways for aspiring mangaka to upload and sell their manga online Before there were two main ways in which a mangaka's work could be published taking their manga drawn on paper to a publisher themselves or submitting their work to competitions run by magazines 90 In recent years there has been a rise in manga released digitally Web manga as it is known in Japan has seen an increase thanks in part to image hosting websites where anyone can upload pages from their works for free Although released digitally almost all web manga sticks to the conventional black and white format despite some never getting physical publication Pi xiv is the most popular site where amateur and professional work gets published on the site It has grown to be the most visited site for artwork in Japan 91 Twitter has also become a popular place for web manga with many artists releasing pages weekly on their accounts in the hope of their work getting picked up or published professionally One of the best examples of an amateur work becoming professional is One Punch Man which was released online and later received a professional remake released digitally and an anime adaptation soon thereafter 92 Many of the big print publishers have also released digital only magazines and websites where web manga get published alongside their serialized magazines Sho gaku kan for instance has two websites Sunday Web ry and Ura Sunday that release weekly chapters for web manga and even offer contests for mangaka to submit their work Both Sunday Web ry and Ura Sunday have become one of the top web manga sites in Japan 93 94 Some have even released apps that teach how to draw professional manga and learn how to create them Weekly Sh nen Jump released Jump Paint an app that guides users on how to make their own manga from making storyboard s to digitally in king lines It also offers more than 120 types of pen tips and more than 1 000 screen tones for artists to practice 90 Kodansha has also used the popularity of web manga to launch more series and also offer better distribution of their officially translated works under Kodansha Comics thanks in part to the titles being released digitally first before being published physically 95 The rise web manga has also been credited to smartphones and computers as more and more readers read manga on their phones rather than from a print publication While paper manga has seen a decrease over time digital manga have been growing in sales each year The Research Institute for Publications reports that sales of digital manga books excluding magazines jumped 27 1 percent to 146 billion in 2016 from the year before while sales of paper manga saw a record year on year decline of 7 4 percent to 194 7 billion They have also said that if the digital and paper keep the same growth and drop rates web manga would exceed their paper counterparts 96 In 2020 manga sales topped the 600 billion mark for the first time in history beating the 1995 peak due to a fast growth of the digital manga market which rose by 82 7 billion from a previous year surpassing print manga sales which have also increased 97 98 Of the total 704 3 billion domestic manga market in Japan in 2024 the digital segment accounted for 512 2 billion excluding print editions 11 While web toons have caught on in popularity as a new medium for comics in Asia Japan has been slow to adopt web toons as the traditional format and print publication still dominate the way manga is created and consumed although this is rapidly changing Despite this one of the biggest web to on publishers in the world Comic o has had success in the traditional Japanese manga market Comic o was launched by NHN Japan the Japanese subsidiary of Korean company NHN Entertainment As of now when there are only two web to on publishers that publish Japanese web toons Comic o and Naver Web to on under the name X OY in Japan Ka kao has also had success by offering licensed manga and translated Korean web toons with their service Pic coma All three companies credit their success to the web to on pay model where users can purchase each chapter individually instead of having to buy the whole book while also offering some chapters for free for a period of time allowing anyone to read a whole series for free if they wait long enough 99 The added benefit of having all of their titles in color and some with special animations and effects have also helped them succeed Some popular Japanese web toons have also gotten anime adaptations and print releases the most notable being Re LIFE and Recovery of an MMO Junkie 100 101 By 2007 the influence of manga on international comics had grown considerably over the past two decades 102 Influence is used here to refer to effects on the comics markets outside Japan and to aesthetic effects on comics artists internationally Traditionally manga stories flow from top to bottom and from right to left Some publishers of translated manga keep to this original format Other publishers mirror the pages horizontally before printing the translation changing the reading direction to a more Western left to right so as not to confuse foreign readers or traditional comics consumers This practice is known as flipping 103 For the most part criticism suggests that flipping goes against the original intentions of the creator for example if a person wears a shirt that reads MAY on it and gets flipped then the word is altered to YAM who may be ignorant of how awkward it is to read comics when the eyes must flow through the pages and text in opposite directions resulting in an experience that's quite distinct from reading something that flows homogeneously If the translation is not adapted to the flipped artwork carefully enough it is also possible for the text to go against the picture such as a person referring to something on their left in the text while pointing to their right in the graphic Characters shown writing with their right hands the majority of them would become left handed when a series is flipped Flipping may also cause oddities with familiar asymmetrical objects or layouts such as a car being depicted with the gas pedal on the left and the brake on the right or a shirt with the buttons on the wrong side however these issues are minor when compared to the unnatural reading flow and some of them could be solved with an adaptation work that goes beyond just translation and blind flipping 104 In April 2023 the Japan Business Federation laid out a proposal aiming to spur the economic growth of Japan by further promoting the contents industry abroad primarily anime manga and video games for measures to invite industry experts from abroad to come to Japan to work and to link with the tourism sector to help foreign fans of manga and anime visit sites across the country associated with particular manga stories The federation seeks to quadruple the sales of Japanese content in overseas markets within the upcoming 10 years 105 106 The increasing globalization of the manga industry has led to Japanese publishers inviting artists from other countries 107 Manga has highly influenced the art styles of man

independently 128 Some U S fans became aware of manga in the 1970 s and early 1980 s 129 However anime was initially more accessible than manga to U S fans 130 many of whom were college age young
