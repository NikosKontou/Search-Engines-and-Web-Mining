    "transformers_text": "Kabuki Japanese pronunciation ka b k i 1 is a classical form of Japanese theatre mixing dramatic performance with traditional dance Kabuki theatre is known for its heavily stylised performances its glamorous highly decorated costumes and for the elaborate kumadori make up worn by some of its performers Kabuki is thought to have originated in the early Edo period when the art's founder Izumo no O kuni formed a female dance troupe that performed dances and light sketches in Kyoto The art form later developed into its present all male theatrical form after women were banned from performing in kabuki theatre in 1629 Kabuki developed throughout the late 17 th century and reached its zenith in the mid 18 th century In 2005 kabuki theatre was proclaimed by UNESCO as an intangible heritage possessing outstanding universal value In 2008 it was inscribed in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity 2 The individual kanji that make up the word kabuki can be read as ' sing ' ' dance ' and 's kill ' Kabuki is therefore sometimes translated as ' the art of singing and dancing ' These are however ate ji characters which do not reflect actual etymology The kanji of 's kill ' generally refers to a performer in kabuki theatre Since the word kabuki is believed to derive from the verb kab uk u meaning ' to lean ' or ' to be out of the ordinary ' the word kabuki can also be interpreted as ' avant garde ' or ' bizarre ' theatre 3 The expression kabuki mono referred originally to those who were bizarrely dressed It is often translated into English as ' strange things ' or ' the crazy ones ' and referred to the style of dress worn by gangs of samurai Another explanation attributes the word kabuki to a verb that was used to describe young samurai patrons meaning being weird or offbeat 4 The history of kabuki began in 1603 during the Edo period when former shrine maiden Izumo no O kuni possibly a miko of Izumo taisha began performing with a troupe of young female dancers a new simple style of dance drama in pantomime on a makeshift stage in the dry bed of the Kamo River in Kyoto 5 6 7 8 In the earliest forms of kabuki female performers played both men and women in comic play lets about ordinary life It did not take long for the style to become popular and O kuni was asked to perform before the Imperial Court In the wake of such success rival troupes quickly formed and kabuki was born as ensemble dance and drama performed by women Much of the appeal of kabuki in this era was due to the ribald suggestive themes featured by many troupes this appeal was further augmented by the fact that many performers were also involved in prostitution 3 For this reason kabuki was also known as ' prostitute kabuki ' during this period Kabuki became a common form of entertainment in the red light districts of Japan especially in Yoshi war a 9 the registered red light district in Edo The widespread appeal of kabuki often meant that a diverse crowd of different social classes gathered to watch performances a unique occurrence that happened nowhere else in the city of Edo Kabuki theatres became well known as a place to both see and be seen in terms of fashion and style as the audience commonly comprising a number of socially low but economically wealthy merchants typically used a performance as a way to feature the fashion trends As an art form kabuki also provided inventive new forms of entertainment featuring new musical styles played on the shamisen clothes and fashion often dramatic in appearance famous actors and stories often intended to mirror current events Performances typically lasted from morning until sunset with surrounding teahouse s providing meals refreshments and place to social is e The area surrounding kabuki theatres also featured a number of shops selling kabuki souvenirs After performances women performers would offer sexual services for those who could afford it Since fights would usually erupt among the young samurai patrons shogun al authorities who wanted to maintain order banned women from performing on stage Following this ban O kuni replaced the women with boys in Kabuki performances During the early seventeenth century within a culture where pederasty was pervasive among samurai her decision didn't significantly harm the theater's popularity In fact it may have even benefited Kabuki as it caught the attention of the third shogun Iemitsu known for his interest in pederasty He even arranged special performances However after Iemitsu's death in 1651 and with samurai now fighting for the attention of boys rather than girls the shogunate imposed further restrictions allowing only males over 15 to perform on stage 5 Kabuki switched to adult male actors called yar o kabuki in the mid 1600 s 10 Adult male actors however continued to play both female and male characters and kabuki retained its popularity remaining a key element of the Edo period urban life style Although kabuki was performed widely across Japan the Nakamura za Ichimura za and Kawa razak i za theatres became the most widely known and popular kabuki theatres where some of the most successful kabuki performances were and still are held 8 During the time period of 1628 1673 the modern version of all male kabuki actors a style of kabuki known as yar kabuki lit young man kabuki was established following the ban on women and young boys Cross dressing male actors known as on nagata lit woman role or oyama took over previously female or waka shu acted roles Young adolescent men were still preferred for women's roles due to their less obviously masculine appearance and the higher pitch of their voices The roles of adolescent men in kabuki known as waka shu were also played by young men often selected for their attractiveness this became a common practice and waka shu were often presented in an erotic context 11 The focus of kabuki performances also increasingly began to emphasise drama alongside dance However the ribald nature of kabuki performances continued with male actors also engaging in sex work for both female and male customers Audiences frequently became rowdy and brawls occasionally broke out sometimes over the favors of a particularly popular or handsome actor leading the shogunate to ban first on nagata and the nwa kash roles for a short period of time both bans were rescinded by 1652 12 During the Genroku period kabuki thrived with the structure of kabuki plays formal ising into the structure they are performed in today alongside many other elements which eventually came to be recognised as a key aspect of kabuki tradition such as conventional character tropes Kabuki theater and n ingy j rur i an elaborate form of puppet theater later known as bunraku became closely associated with each other mutually influencing the other's further development The famous playwright Chi ka matsu Monza em on one of the first professional kabuki playwrights produced several influential works during this time though the piece usually acknowledged as his most significant S one zak i Shin j The Love Suicides at S one zak i was originally written for bunraku Like many bunraku plays it was adapted for kabuki eventually becoming popular enough to reportedly inspire a number of real life copycat suicides and leading to a government ban on shin ju mono plays about love suicides in 1723 Also during the Genroku period was the development of the mie style of posing credited to kabuki actor Ichikawa Dan j r I 13 alongside the development of the mask like kumadori makeup worn by kabuki actors in some plays 14 In the mid 18 th century kabuki fell out of favor for a time with bunraku taking its place as the premier form of stage entertainment among the lower social classes That occurred partly because of the emergence of several skilled bunraku playwrights in that time Little of note would occur in the further development of kabuki until the end of the century when it began to reemerge in popularity In the 1840 s repeated periods of drought led to a series of fires affecting Edo with kabuki theatres traditionally made of wood frequently burning down forcing many to relocate When the area that housed the Nakamura za was completely destroyed in 1841 the sh gun refused to allow the theatre to be rebuilt saying that it was against fire code 10 The shogunate mostly disapproving of the social is ation and trade that occurred in kabuki theatres between merchants actors and prostitutes took advantage of the fire crisis in the following year forcing the Nakamura za Ichimura za and Kawa razak i za out of the city limits and into Asakusa a northern suburb of Edo This was part of the larger Ten p Reforms that the shogunate instituted starting in 1842 to restrict the overindulgence of pleasures 15 Actors stagehands and others associated with the performances were also forced to move as a result of the death of their livelihood despite the move of everyone involved in kabuki performance and many in the surrounding areas to the new location of the theatres the inconvenience of the distance led to a reduction in attendance 8 These factors along with strict regulations pushed much of kabuki underground in Edo with performances changing locations to avoid the authorities The theatres ' new location was called S aru waka ch or S aru waka machi the last thirty years of the Tokugawa shogunate's rule is often referred to as the S aru waka machi period and is well known for having produced some of the most exaggerated kabuki in Japanese history 8 S aru waka machi became the new theatre district for the Nakamura za Ichimura za and Kawa razak i za theatres The district was located on the main street of Asakusa which ran through the middle of the small city The street was renamed after S aru waka Kanza bur o who initiated Edo kabuki in the Nakamura za in 1624 8 European artists began noticing Japanese theatrical performances and artwork and many artists such as Claude Monet were inspired by Japanese woodblock prints This Western interest prompted Japanese artists to increase their depictions of daily life including the depiction of theatres brothels main streets and so on One artist Utagawa Hiroshige produced a series of prints based on S aru waka from the S aru waka machi period in Asakusa 8 Despite the revival of kabuki in another location the relocation diminished the tradition's most abundant inspirations for costuming make up and storylines Ichikawa Koda nji IV was considered one of the most active and successful actors during the S aru waka machi period Deemed unattractive he mainly performed buy or dancing in dramas written by Kawa take M oku ami who also wrote during the Meiji era to follow 8 Kawa take M oku ami commonly wrote plays that depicted the common lives of the people of Edo He introduced sh ichigo cho seven and five syllable meter dialogue and music such as kiyo moto 8 His kabuki performances became quite popular once the S aru waka machi period ended and theatre returned to Edo many of his works are still performed In 1868 the Tokugawa ceased to exist with the restoration of the Emperor Emperor Meiji was restored to power and moved from Kyoto to the new capital of Edo or Tokyo beginning the Meiji period 10 Kabuki once again returned to the pleasure quarters of Edo and throughout the Meiji period became increasingly more radical as modern styles of kabuki plays and performances emerged Playwrights experimented with the introduction of new genres to kabuki and introduced twists on traditional stories Beginning in 1868 enormous cultural changes such as the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate the elimination of the samurai class and the opening of Japan to the West helped to spark kabuki's re emergence Both actors and playwrights strove to improve the reputation of kabuki in the face of new foreign influence and amongst the upper classes partially through adapting traditional styles to modern tastes This endeavour would prove successful with the Emperor sponsoring a kabuki performance on 21 April 1887 16 After World War II the occupying forces briefly banned kabuki which had formed a strong base of support for Japan's war efforts since 1931 17 This ban was in conjunction with broader restrictions on media and art forms that the American military occupation instituted after WWII 18 However by 1947 the ban on kabuki was rescinded but censorship rules lingered 19 The ensuing period of occupation following World War II posited a difficult time for kabuki besides the war's physical impact and devastation upon the country some schools of thought chose to reject both the styles and art forms of pre war Japan kabuki amongst them 20 Director Te tsuji Take chi's popular and innovative productions of kabuki classics at this time are credited with sparking new interest in kabuki in the Kansai region 21 Of the many popular young stars who performed with the Take chi Kabuki Nakamura Gan jiro III b 1931 was the leading figure first known as Nakamura Sen jaku before taking his current name It was this period of kabuki in Osaka that became known as the Age of Sen jaku in his honor 21 Today kabuki is the most popular of the traditional styles of Japanese drama with its star actors often appearing in television or film roles 22 Well known on nagata actor Band Tamas a bur V has appeared in several non kabuki plays and movies often in the role of a woman Kabuki also appears in works of Japanese popular culture such as anime In addition to the handful of major theatres in Tokyo and Kyoto there are many smaller theatres in Osaka and throughout the countryside 23 The shi ka Kabuki troupe based in shi ka Nagano Prefecture is one example 24 Some local kabuki troupes today use female actors in on nagata roles The Ichikawa Sh jo Kabuki Geki dan an all female troupe debuted in 1953 to significant acclaim though the majority of kabuki troupes have remained entirely male 25 The introduction of earphone guides in 1975 26 including an English version in 1982 26 helped broaden the art form's appeal As a result in 1991 the Kabuki za one of Tokyo's best known kabuki theaters began year round performances 26 and in 2005 began marketing kabuki cinema films 27 Kabuki troupes regularly tour Asia 28 Europe 29 and America 30 and there have been several kabuki themed productions of Western plays such as those of Shakespeare Western playwrights and novelists have also experimented with kabuki themes an example of which is Gerald Viz en or's Hiroshima Bug i 2004 Writer Yukio Mishima pioneered and popularised the use of kabuki in modern settings and revived other traditional arts such as Noh adapting them to modern contexts There have even been kabuki troupes established in countries outside Japan For instance in Australia the Za Kabuki troupe at the Australian National University has performed a kabuki drama each year since 1976 31 the longest regular kabuki performance outside Japan 32 In November 2002 a statue was erected in honor of kabuki's founder Izumo no O kuni and to commemorate 400 years of kabuki's existence 33 Diagonally across from the Minami za 34 the last remaining kabuki theater in Kyoto 34 it stands at the east end of a bridge Shi j hashi 34 crossing the Kamo River in Kyoto Kabuki was inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists in 2005 35 36 While still maintaining most of the historical practices of kabuki Ichikawa En 37 aimed to broaden its appeal by creating a new genre of kabuki productions called Super Kabuki With Yamato Take ru as the first Super Kabuki production to premiere in 1986 remakes of traditional plays and new contemporary creations have been brought to local theaters throughout the country including anime based productions such as Naruto or One Piece starting from 2014 Super Kabuki has sparked controversy within the Japanese population regarding the extent of modification of the traditional art form 38 Some who say that it has lost its 400 year history citation needed while others consider the adaptations necessary for contemporary relevance Regardless since incorporating more advanced technology in the new stage sets costumes and lighting Super Kabuki has regained interest from the young demographic 39 40 In addition Square Enix announced a Super Kabuki adaptation of Final Fantasy X collaborating with Tokyo Broadcasting System in 2022 Entitled Kinoshita Group presents New Kabuki Final Fantasy X and part of celebrations of the Final Fantasy franchise's 35 th anniversary it is scheduled to be performed at the IHI Stage Around Tokyo from March 4 to April 12 2023 41 42 The kabuki stage features a projection called a hanami chi flower path a walkway which extends into the audience and via which dramatic entrances and exits are made O kuni also performed on a hanami chi stage with her entourage The stage is used not only as a walkway or path to get to and from the main stage but important scenes are also played on the stage Kabuki stages and theaters have steadily become more technologically sophisticated and innovations including revolving stages and trap doors were introduced during the 18 th century A driving force has been the desire to manifest one frequent theme of kabuki theater that of the sudden dramatic revelation or transformation 43 A number of stage tricks including actors ' rapid appearance and disappearance employ these innovations The term ker en often translated as playing to the gallery is sometimes used as a catch all for these tricks The hanami chi and several innovations including revolving stage seri and chun ori have all contributed to kabuki The hanami chi creates depth and both seri and chun ori provide a vertical dimension Ma war i but a i revolving stage developed in the Ky h era 1716 1735 The trick was originally accomplished by the on stage pushing of a round wheeled platform Later a circular platform was embedded in the stage with wheels beneath it facilitating movement The kura ten darkened revolve technique involves lowering the stage lights during this transition More commonly the lights are left on for aka ten lighted revolve sometimes simultaneously performing the transitioning scenes for dramatic effect This stage was first built in Japan in the early 18 th century Seri refers to the stage traps that have been commonly employed in kabuki since the middle of the 18 th century These traps raise and lower actors or sets to the stage Seri dashi or seri age refers to trap s moving upward and seri sage or seri oro shi to traps descending This technique is often used to lift an entire scene at once Ch nori riding in mid air is a technique which appeared toward the middle of the 19 th century by which an actor's costume is attached to wires and he is made to fly over the stage or certain parts of the auditorium This is similar to the wire trick in the stage musical Peter Pan in which Peter launches himself into the air It is still one of the most popular ker en visual tricks in kabuki today major kabuki theaters such as the National Theatre Kabuki za and Minami za are all equipped with ch nori installations 44 Scenery changes are sometimes made mid scene while the actors remain on stage and the curtain stays open This is sometimes accomplished by using a Hik i D gu or small wagon stage This technique originated at the beginning of the 18 th century where scenery or actors move on or off stage on a wheeled platform Also common are stagehands rushing on to the stage adding and removing props backdrops and other scenery these kuro ko are always dressed entirely in black and are traditionally considered invisible Stagehands also assist in a variety of quick costume changes known as haya gawar i quick change technique When a character's true nature is suddenly revealed the devices of hik in uki and bukka eri are often used This involves layering one costume over another and having a stagehand pull the outer one off in front of the audience The curtain that shields the stage before the performance and during the breaks is in the traditional colours of black red and green in various order or white instead of green vertical stripes The curtain consists of one piece and is pulled back to one side by a staff member by hand An additional outer curtain called don cho was not introduced until the Meiji era following the introduction of western influence These are more ornate in their appearance and are woven They depict the season in which the performance is taking place often designed by renowned Nihon ga artists 45 Since feudal laws in 17 th century Japan prohibited replicating the looks of samurai or nobility and the use of luxurious fabrics the kabuki costumes were groundbreaking new designs to the general public even setting trends that still exist today Although the earliest kabuki costumes have not been preserved separate o toko and on nagata kabuki costumes today are made based on written records called ukiyo e and in collaboration with those whose families have been in the kabuki industry for generations 46 The kimono the actors wear for their costumes are typically made with vibrant colours and multiple layers Both o toko and on nagata wear hakama pleated trousers in some plays and both use padding underneath their costumes to create the correct body shape for the outfit Kabuki makeup provides an element of style easily recognizable even by those unfamiliar with the art form Rice powder is used to create the white o shiro i base for the characteristic stage makeup and kumadori enhances or exaggerates facial lines to produce dramatic animal or supernatural masks The colour of the kumadori is an expression of the character's nature red lines are used to indicate passion heroism righteousness and other positive traits blue or black villainy jealousy and other negative traits green the supernatural and purple nobility 14 Another special feature of kabuki costumes is the katsura or the wig 46 Each actor has a different wig made for every role constructed from a thin base of hand beaten copper custom made to fit the actor perfectly and each wig is usually styled in a traditional manner The hair used in the wigs is typically real human hair hand sewn on to ahab ota i base though some styles of wig require yak hair or horse hair The three main categories of kabuki play are jidaimono historical or pre Sengoku period stories sewamono domestic or post Sengoku period stories and shosagoto dance pieces 47 Jidaimono or history plays are set within the context of major events in Japanese history Strict censorship laws during the Edo period prohibited the representation of contemporary events and particularly prohibited criticising the shogunate or casting it in a bad light although enforcement varied greatly over the years Many shows were set in the context of the Gen pei War of the 1180 s the Nanboku ch Wars of the 1330 s or other historical events Frustrating the censors many shows used these historical settings as metaphors for contemporary events Kana deh on Ch shin gura one of the most famous plays in the kabuki repertoire serves as an excellent example it is ostensibly set in the 1330 s though it actually depicts the contemporary 18 th century affair of the revenge of the 47 r n in Unlike jidaimono which generally focused upon the samurai class sewamono focused primarily upon commoners namely townspeople and peasants Often referred to as domestic plays in English sewamono generally related to themes of family drama and romance Some of the most famous sewamono are the love suicide plays adapted from works by the bunraku playwright Chi ka matsu these center on romantic couples who cannot be together in life due to various circumstances and who therefore decide to be together in death instead Many if not most sewamono contain significant elements of this theme of societal pressures and limitations Shosagoto pieces place their emphasis on dance which may be performed with or without dialogue where dance can be used to convey emotion character and plot 48 Quick costume change techniques may sometimes be employed in such pieces Notable examples include Musume D j ji and Ren j ishi Naga uta musicians may be seated in rows on stepped platforms behind the dancers 49 Important elements of kabuki include the mie in which the actor holds a picturesque pose to establish his character 43 At this point his house name ya g is sometimes heard in loud shout kake go e from an expert audience member serving both to express and enhance the audience's appreciation of the actor's achievement An even greater compliment can be paid by shouting the name of the actor's father The main actor has to convey a wide variety of emotions between a fallen drunkard person and someone who in reality is quite different since he is only faking his weakness such as the character of Yu rano suke inCh shin gura This is called hara gei or belly acting which means he has to perform from within to change characters It is technically difficult to perform and takes a long time to learn but once mastered the audience takes up on the actor's emotion Emotions are also expressed through the colours of the costumes a key element in kabuki Gaudy and strong colours can convey foolish or joyful emotions whereas severe or muted colours convey seriousness and focus Kabuki like other forms of drama traditionally performed in Japan was and sometimes still is performed in full day programmes with one play comprising a number of acts spanning the entire day However these plays particularly sewamono were commonly sequenced with acts from other plays in order to produce a full day programme as the individual acts in a kabuki play commonly functioned as stand alone performances in and of themselves Sewamono plays in contrast were generally not sequenced with acts from other plays and genuinely would take the entire day to perform The structure of a full day performance was derived largely from the conventions of both bunraku and Noh theatre Chief amongst these was the concept of jo ha ky a pacing convention in theatre stating that the action of a play should start slow speed up and end quickly The concept elaborated on at length by master Noh playwright Zeami governs not only the actions of the actors but also the structure of the play as well as the structure of scenes and plays within a day long programme Nearly every full length play occupies five acts The first corresponds tojo an auspicious and slow opening which introduces the audience to the characters and the plot The next three acts correspond to ha where events speed up culminating almost always in a great moment of drama or tragedy in the third act and possibly a battle in the second or fourth acts The final act corresponding to ky is almost always short providing a quick and satisfying conclusion 50 While many plays were written solely for kabuki many others were taken from j rur i plays Noh plays folklore or other performing traditions such as the oral tradition of the Tale of the Heike While j rur i plays tend to have serious emotionally dramatic and organised plots plays written specifically for kabuki generally have looser more humorous plots 51 One crucial difference between j rur i and kabuki is a difference in storytelling focus whereas j rur i focuses on the story and on the chanter who recites it kabuki has a greater focus on the actors themselves A j rur i play may sacrifice the details of sets puppets or action in favor of the chanter while kabuki is known to sacrifice drama and even the plot to highlight an actor's talents It was not uncommon in kabuki to insert or remove individual scenes from a day's schedule in order to cater to an individual actor either scenes he was famed for or that featured him would be inserted into a program without regard to plot continuity 51 Certain plays were also performed uncommonly as they required an actor to be proficient in a number of instruments which would be played live onstage a skill that few actors possessed 52 Kabuki traditions in Edo and the Kyoto Osaka region Kami gata differed throughout the Edo period Edo kabuki was defined by its extravagance both in the appearance of its actors their costumes stage tricks and bold mie poses In contrast Kami gata kabuki focused on natural and realistic styles of acting Only towards the end of the Edo period did the two styles begin to merge to any significant degree 53 Before this time actors from different regions often failed to adjust their acting styles when performing elsewhere leading to unsuccessful performance tours outside of their usual region of performance While there are many famous plays known today many of the most famous were written in the mid Edo period and were originally written for bunraku theatre Every kabuki actor has a stage name which is different from the name they were born with These stage names most often those of the actor's father grandfather or teacher are passed down between generations of actors ' lineages and hold great honor and importance Many names are associated with certain roles or acting styles and the new possessor of each name must live up to these expectations there is the feeling almost of the actor not only taking a name but embodying the spirit style or skill of each actor to previously hold that name Many actors will go through at least three names over the course of their career Sh mei name succession are grand naming ceremonies held in kabuki theatres in front of the audience Most often a number of actors will participate in a single ceremony taking on new stage names Their participation in ash mei represents their passage into a new chapter of their performing careers Kabuki actors are typically part of a school of acting or are associated with a particular theatre Since its beginning kabuki has remained a significant piece of Japanese culture The stories and actors have been recreated in many different art forms including woodblock prints books magazines oral storytelling photography in later years and others Additionally kabuki was and continues to be influenced by the books and stories circulating in Japan In one such instance the widely popular book Nan s Sato mi Hak ken den 56 or Eight Dogs was acted out in various episodes on the kabuki stage One important way the laboring class was able to enjoy kabuki performances outside of the stage was through home brewed shows called No son kabuki village kabuki Also referred to as amateur kabuki these performances took place at the local level across Japan but were most commonly held in the Gifu and Aichi prefectures In Gifu Prefecture specifically no son kabuki was a prominent feature of the annual autumn festival with children's reenactments of kabuki performances taking place at Mura kuni shrine for over 300 years Closer to the cultural epicenter of kabuki in Edo later Tokyo commoners had other methods to enjoy performances without attending the shows Bunraku puppet theatre 57 was a type of performance shorter in length and more affordable to the common class than kabuki Bunraku performances were often based on plots used in kabuki and the two styles shared common themes Kabuki shinp Kabuki news 58 was another popular medium for kabuki consumption among commoners and elites a like During the course of its publication this magazine allowed those unable to attend performances to enjoy the liveliness of kabuki culture",
