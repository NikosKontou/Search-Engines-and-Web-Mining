    "transformers_text": "Wired is a bi monthly American magazine that focuses on how emerging technologies affect culture the economy and politics It is published in both print and online editions by Cond Nast The magazine has been in publication since its launch in January 1993 2 Its editorial office is based in San Francisco California with its business headquarters located in New York City Wired quickly became recognized as the voice of the emerging digital economy and culture 3 and a pace setter in print design and web design 4 5 From 1998 until 2006 the magazine and its website Wired com experienced separate ownership before being fully consolidated under Cond Nast in 2006 It has won multiple National Magazine Awards 6 7 and has been credited with shaping discourse around the digital revolution The magazine coined the term crowd sourcing 8 as well as its annual tradition of handing out Vaporware Awards Wired has launched several international editions including Wired UK Wired Italia Wired Japan Wired Czech Republic and Slovakia 9 and Wired Germany The magazine was published monthly until 2024 when it switched to a bi monthly schedule with six issues per year The magazine was launched in 1993 by American expatriates Louis Ros set to with his life partner and business partner Jane Metcalfe Wired was conceived in Amsterdam the Netherlands when they were working on Electric Word a small groundbreaking technology magazine that developed a global following because of its focus not just on hardware and software but the people companies and ideas that were part of what they called the language industries 10 Whole Earth Review called it The Least Boring Computer Magazine in the World This broader focus on the social economic and political issues surrounding technology became the core of the Wired editorial approach 10 Initial funding for Wired was provided by Eck art Win tzen a Dutch entrepreneur His Origin software company extended a contract for advertising and bought the first 1000 subscribers 11 Ros set to and Metcalfe moved back to the United States to start Wired finding the European Union not a cohesive enough media market to support a continent wide publication 10 Origin's upfront payment 12 was the seed capital which saw Ros set to and Metcalfe through 12 fruitless months of fundraising They approached established computer and lifestyle publishers as well as venture capitalists and met constant rejection The Wired business concept was a radical departure Computer magazines carried no lifestyle advertising and lifestyle magazines carried no computer advertising 13 And Wired's target audience of Digital Visionaries was unknown 14 Wired's fundraising breakthrough came when they showed a prototype to Nicholas Negro ponte founder and head of theM IT Media Lab at the February 1992 TED Conference 15 which Richard Saul Wurm an com ped them to attend Negro ponte agreed to become the first investor in Wired but even before he could write his check software entrepreneur Charlie Jackson deposited the first investor money in the Wired account a few weeks later 16 Negro ponte was to become a regular columnist for six years through 1998 wrote the book Being Digital and later founded One Laptop per Child By September 1992 Wired had rented loft space in the SoMa district of San Francisco off South Park 17 and hired its first employees As Editor and CEO Ros set to oversaw content and business strategy and Metcalfe as President and COO oversaw advertising circulation finance and company operations Kevin Kelly was executive editor John Plunkett creative director and John Bat tell e managing editor 18 John Plunkett's wife and partner Barbara Kuh r Plunkett Kuh r later became the launch creative director of Wired's website Hot wired 5 They were to remain with Wired through the first six years of publication 1993 98 Ros set to and Metcalfe were aided in starting Wired by Ian Charles Stewart who helped write the original business plan John Plunkett who designed the Manifesto Eugene Mosier who provided production support to create the first prototype and later became Art Director for Production and Randy Stick rod who provided Ros set to and Metcalfe refuge in his office on South Park when they first arrived in San Francisco 17 ID G's George Clark arranged nationwide newsstand distribution Associate publisher Kathleen Lyman joined Wired from News Corporation and Ziff Davis to execute on its ambition to attract both technology and lifestyle advertising and delivered from the first issue She and her prot g Simon Ferguson Wired's first advertising manager landed pioneering campaigns by a diverse group of industry leaders such as Apple Computer Intel Sony Calvin Klein and Ab sol ut Lyman and Ferguson left in year two Cond Nast veteran 19 Dana Lyon then took over ad sales Two years after they left Amsterdam and nearly five years after they first started work on the business plan Metcalfe and Ros set to and their initial band of twelve Wired Ones launched Wired as a quarterly on 6 January 1993 and first distributed it by hand at Macworld Expo in San Francisco and later that week at the Consumer Electronics Show CES in Las Vegas 13 Copies arrived on newsstand two weeks later as Bill Clinton took office as President with his Vice President Al Gore touting the Information Superhighway Due to the work of John Bat tell e's fianc e ex CBS producer Michelle S cile ppi feature pieces on Wired s launch appeared on CNN and in The San Jose Mercury News Newsweek and Time magazines 22 Circulation and advertising response was so strong that Wired went bi monthly with its next issue and monthly by September with the William Gibson cover story about Singapore called Disneyland with the Death Penalty which was banned there In January 1994 Advance Publications's Cond Nast made a minority investment in Wired Ventures 23 And in April that year Wired won its first National Magazine Award for General Excellence for its first year of publication During Ros set to's five years as editor it would be nominated for General Excellence every year win the design award in 1996 and a second General Excellence in 1997 Wired s founding executive editor Kevin Kelly had been an editor of the Whole Earth Catalog Co Evolution Quarterly and the Whole Earth Review He brought with him contributing writers from those publications Six authors of the first Wired issue 1 1 had written for Whole Earth Review most notably Bruce Sterling who was on the first cover and Stewart Brand Other contributors to Whole Earth who appeared in Wired included William Gibson who was also featured on Wired's cover in its first year 24 Wired co founder Ros set to claimed in his launch editorial that the Digital Revolution is whipping through our lives like a Bengali typhoon 25 a bold statement at the time when there were no smart phones web browsers and less than 10 million users connected to the Internet around the world barely half that in the United States 26 Bold also describes John Plunkett's graphic design and its use of fluorescent s and metallic s Uniquely for magazines Wired was printed on a new state of the art high end six color press normally used for annual reports 10 The first issue covered interactive games cell phone hacking digital special effects digital libraries an interview with Camille Pag lia by Stewart Brand digital surveillance Bruce Sterling's cover story about military simulations and Karl Taro Green fe ld s story on Japanese otaku 27 And while Wired was one of the first magazines to list the email addresses of its authors and contributors the column by Nicholas Negro ponte while written in the style of an email message surprisingly contained an obviously fake non standard email address 28 That was remedied in the second issue Wired first mentioned the World Wide Web in its third issue 28 after CERN put it in the public domain in April Subsequently Wired focused extensively on the networking explosion carrying cover stories on Yahoo's origin story Neal Stephenson's 50 000 word epic essay on the laying of the fiber optic data link from London to Japan and Bill Gate's media strategy for Microsoft On October 27 1994 20 months after its first issue and following the introduction of the first graphic web browser Mosaic Wired Ventures launched it sHot wired website the first with original content and Fortune 500 advertising 29 Inventing the banner ad Wired brought AT T Volvo MCI Club Med and seven other companies to the web for the first time on websites built by Jonathan Nelson's Organic Online 30 Among the launch crew of 12 was Jonathan St eu er who led the group Just in Hall 31 a pioneer blogger who ran his own successful site on the side Howard Rheingold as executive editor and Apache server co creator Brian Be hlen dorf who was webmaster 24 Convinced the Web was the future of media 10 Wired expanded Hot wired using Cond Nast's investment into a suite of websites to include Ask Dr Weil Rough Guides extreme sports and cocktails In 1996 it introduced its search engine Hot Botin partnership with Berkeley startup Ink to mi Hot wired pioneered many of the features and techniques that would go on to define online journalism and online content creation in general 32 The web was so new at the time Wired hired forty engineers to write the code for its edit and ad serving software By the end of 1995 Hot wired ranked sixth among all websites for revenue ahead of ESPN CNET and CNN 33 The New York Times commented Wired is more than a successful magazine Like Rolling Stone in the 60's it has become the totem of a major cultural movement 3 Wired's expansion accelerated By 1996 it had launched a book publishing division Hard Wired licensed a Japanese edition with Doh osha Publishing created a British edition Wired UK in a joint venture with the Guardian newspaper 34 and had signed with Gru ner and Jah r to do a German edition to be headquartered in Berlin 35 And it began work on Wired TV in partnership with MSNBC 36 as well as three new magazine titles a shelter book called Neo to be edited by Wired Editor At Large Katrina Her on and designed by Rhonda Ruben stein a business magazine called The New Economy and a concept magazine with New York design star Tibor Kal man focusing on the countdown to the new millennium 37 In 1996 reacting to the IPO s of web competitors Yahoo Lycos Excite and Info seek Wired Ventures announced its own IPO It selected Goldman Sachs and Robertson Stephens as co leads with Goldman managing The June IPO was postponed when the market declined When it finally went out in October Goldman was unable to close the round following another market downturn and Wired withdrew its IPO 38 Finger pointing followed Some observers claimed the market rejected Wired's 293 million internet valuation as too rich for a traditional publishing company 39 Wired claimed its valuation was confirmed by savvy private investors who put 12 5 million into the company in May 40 at just under the original offering stock price It also argued that the offering price set by the bankers was merited for pioneering web media and its revenue at Hot wired was greater than Yahoo's when it went public at a higher valuation than Wired's 41 Wired executives blamed Goldman for mismanaging their IPO and not closing the round which already had investors booked 38 The Goldman executive who managed the IPO is quoted as saying Had the market not been so volatile I believe the offering would have been quite successful 38 The IPO failure left Wired Ventures cash strapped It turned to its current investor Tudor Investment Corporation Tudor brought on Providence Equity Capital concluding a private funding at the end of December 1996 42 Wired then proceeded to cut costs by focusing on its US magazine and web businesses shutting its UK magazine its book company and its TV operation and terminating work on new magazines By June Wired magazine was profitable The web company now rebranded Wired Digital was growing 43 Wired execs wanted to try to go public again in 1998 catching what was to be the second run up in internet stocks which resulted in the 1999 dot com bubble In 1996 Wired Digital made up 7 percent of the company's revenues and in 1997 it pulled in 30 percent The unit was expected to contribute about 40 percent of revenues in 1998 44 Providence and Tudor had other plans and hired Lazar d F re res to shop the company Ros set to and Metcalfe lost control of Wired Ventures in March 1998 The Street com commented that a company that started out as one of the more promising bastions of the digital revolution lost control to old fashioned vulture capitalism 45 Providence Tudor quickly cut a deal to sell the magazine to Miller Publishing for 77 million When Wired Ventures investor Cond Nast heard about the deal through a leak to a Silicon Valley gossip columnist 46 they peremptorily outbid Miller and bought Wired magazine for 90 million The month of the sale Wired s magazine and web businesses became cash flow positive Cond Nast declined to buy Wired Digital Four months later Providence Tudor sold Wired Digital to Lycos The deal almost did not close Wired Ventures's founders and early investors threatened lawsuits against Tudor and Providence for breach of fiduciary responsibility claiming they were engaging in unfair distribution of proceeds from the sale amounting to 50 100 million Ultimately the controlling investors relented and the deal closed in June 1999 for 285 million 45 At that point Wired Digital was also cash flow positive Combined proceeds of the two sales exceeded the Wired Ventures valuation at the time of its failed IPO Ros set to's penultimate issue was five years after his first in January 1998 Appropriately the issue was entitled Change is Good Wired's unofficial slogan 10 In his last issue in February he ushered in a complete redesign of the magazine the first since its start 47 Katrina Her on became Wired s second editor in chief with the March 1998 issue Wired magazine's new owner Cond Nast kept the editorial offices in San Francisco but moved the business offices to New York Wired survived the dot com bubble under the business leadership of publisher Drew Schu tte who expanded the brands reach by launching The Wired Store 48 and Wired Next Fest In 2001 Wired found new editorial direction under editor in chief Chris Anderson making the magazine's coverage more mainstream 49 The print magazine's average page length however declined significantly from 1996 to 2001 and then again from 2001 to 2003 50 In 2009 Cond Nast Italia launched the Italian edition of Wired and Wired it 51 On April 2 2009 Cond Nast relaunched the UK edition of Wired edited by David Rowan and launched Wired co uk 52 In 2006 Cond Nast repurchased Wired Digital from Lycos returning the website to the same company that published the magazine reuniting the brand In August 2023 Katie Drummond was announced as the new editor of Wired 53 In 2025 during the second presidency of Donald Trump Wired became noted for breaking numerous stories about the Trump administration and El on Musk's Department of Government Efficiency DOGE 54 Musk criticized the magazine saying Wired went from being about technology to being an unreadable far left wing propaganda mouthpiece 54 In August 2025 Jacob Fur edi the former deputy editor of Un Herd and editor of the publication Dispatch investigated articles on Business Insider and Wired written by a supposed freelancer named Margaux Blanchard after receiving an email After concluding that the articles were A I generated he contacted Press Gazette Both Business Insider and Wired subsequently removed the articles 55 56 Wired's web presence started with its launch of Hot wired com in October 1994 Hot wired was the first website with original content and Fortune 500 advertising Hot wired grew into a variety of vertical content sites including Web monkey Ask Dr Weil Talk com Wired News and the search engine Hot bot In 1997 all were rebranded under Wired Digital The Wired com website formerly known as Wired News and Hot wired launched in October 1994 57 The website and magazine were split in 1998 when the former was sold to Cond Nast and the latter to Lycos 58 in September 1998 The two remained independent until Cond Nast purchased Wired News on July 11 2006 59 This move finally reunited the Wired brand As of February 2018
