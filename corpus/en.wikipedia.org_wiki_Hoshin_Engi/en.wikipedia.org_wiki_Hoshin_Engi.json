    "transformers_text": "Hoshin Engi ( Japanese : 封神演義 , Hepburn : Hōshin Engi ; 'Investiture of the Gods') is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Ryu Fujisaki , inspired by the Chinese literary classic Investiture of the Gods , a shenmo novel. The manga was serialized in Shueisha 's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from June 1996 to November 2000, with its chapters collected in 23 tankōbon volumes. The story involves Chinese mythology and history of China, in particular the last members of the Yin dynasty , and the plot to overthrow them. In North America, the manga was licensed for English release by Viz Media . Fujisaki also wrote a short gaiden manga, titled Hoshin Engi Gaiden: Senkai Dōsho , serialized in Weekly Young Jump from April to June 2018.\n\nA 26-episode anime television series, released in English under the title Soul Hunter , was broadcast on TV Tokyo from July to December 1999. A second 23-episode anime television series adaptation, titled Hakyu Hoshin Engi , was broadcast from January to June 2018. The first anime series was first licensed in North America by ADV Films in 2001; it was later acquired by Discotek Media in 2016.\n\nThe Hoshin Engi manga has had over 22 million copies in circulation .\n\nSet in a fictional ancient China, during the Yin dynasty , the fantastic world of Hoshin Engi encompass both the pre-historical world—in which primitive human society coexist with the revered divine gods and goddesses—and the futuristic world—in which highly technological weaponry, combat strategy, as well as futuristic visions, are employed. The Sennin ( 仙人 , Sen'nin ) [ a ] are a group of powerful immortals or hermits with extraordinary abilities and knowledge, who have gained immortality through various means. They possess great wisdom, longevity, and often exhibit exceptional magical or supernatural powers. Each Sennin has their unique skills and abilities, which they use to navigate the world and influence events. The humans who undergo training to become Sennin are known as Doshi ( 道士 , Dōshi ) . Both Sennin and Doshi use the sacred weapons paope ( 宝貝 , Paopee ) , versatile instruments that absorb the spiritual energy of their beholders and from their surroundings to amplify their power.\n\nA female fox spirit named Dakki exerts control over King Chu and the Yin dynasty, manipulating him to spread corruption and suffering throughout the land. A Doshi named Taikobo is tasked by his mentor, Genshi Tenson , leader of the Sennin World ( 仙人界 , Sennin Kai ) , with executing the Hoshin Project ( 封神計画 , Hōshin Keikaku ) . This mission involves sealing Dakki and her followers in the Shinkai ( 神界 ; 'Realm of the Gods') , a liminal space between the Sennin World and the Human World. To achieve this, Taikobo must locate and defeat 365 individuals whose names appear on the Hoshin List, with their souls subsequently imprisoned on the Hoshindai ( 封神台 , Hōshindai ) , a floating island designed to contain them until the ritual is complete. Accompanied by his loyal reiju ( 霊獣 , reijū ; 'Spirit Beast' or 'Sacred Beast') , Supushan, Taikobo navigates a world of shifting alliances and conflicts among immortals, uncovering the extent of Dakki's influence over both King Chu and the Human World.\n\nAs Taikobo delves deeper into his mission, he uncovers the celestial struggle between gods and immortals, realizing its profound impact on mortal affairs. Caught between his duty as an immortal and his empathy for humanity, he becomes entangled in the conflict. The war culminates in the devastation of both the Sennin and Human Worlds, with countless souls confined to the Hoshindai. Following King Chu's defeat and the fall of the Yin dynasty, Taikobo prepares to return to the remnants of the Sennin World, only to discover the existence of a third realm—Dakki's hidden domain, where she and her remaining followers have retreated.\n\nThe true purpose of the Hoshin Project is ultimately revealed to extend beyond Dakki, targeting the primordial entity Joka , one of the First Persons ( 最初の人 , Saisho no Hito ) —ancient extraterrestrial beings who arrived on Earth eons ago. Joka, seeking to reshape the world in the image of her lost home, repeatedly annihilates civilizations that deviate from her vision. After forming an alliance with Dakki, she orchestrates history's course until the Sennin intervene. When thwarted, Joka resolves to destroy Earth entirely. In the ensuing battle, Taikobo, recently deceased, reappears, disclosed as one of the First Persons. Drawing upon the energies of his allies and the souls within the Hoshindai, he reawakens as Fukki and defeats Joka, ending her tyranny.\n\nPrior to this, Dakki briefly usurps Joka's form, merging with Earth's life force to become a primordial mother figure. In Joka's final moments, she implores Taikobo to accompany her into oblivion, fearing solitude. Though he initially consents, Dakki intervenes to preserve his existence. In the aftermath, Supushan ventures into the Human World to recount these events, only to find Taikobo alive yet elusive, deliberately avoiding contact while discreetly observing his companions. After a period of wandering, Taikobo embarks on a new journey, his destination unknown.\n\nWritten and illustrated by Ryu Fujisaki , Hoshin Engi is inspired by the novel of the same title by Tsutomu Ano [ ja ] , which is a Japanese translation of the Chinese literary classic Investiture of the Gods , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] published by Kodansha between 1988 and 1989.
