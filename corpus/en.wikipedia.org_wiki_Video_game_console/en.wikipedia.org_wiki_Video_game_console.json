    "transformers_text": "A video game console is an electronic device that outputs a video signal or image to display a video game that can typically be played with a game controller These may be home consoles which are generally placed in a permanent location connected to a television or other display devices and controlled with a separate game controller or handheld consoles which include their own display unit and controller functions built into the unit and which can be played anywhere Hybrid consoles combine elements of both home and handheld consoles Video game consoles are a specialized form of home computer geared towards video game playing designed with afford ability and accessibility to the general public in mind but lacking in raw computing power and customization Simplicity is achieved in part through the use of game cartridges or other simplified methods of distribution easing the effort of launching a game However this leads to ubiquitous proprietary formats that create competition for market share 1 More recent consoles have shown further confluence with home computers making it easy for developers to release games on multiple platforms Further modern consoles can serve as replacements for media players with capabilities to play films and music from optical media or streaming media services Video game consoles are usually sold on a five seven year cycle called a generation with consoles made with similar technical capabilities or made around the same time period grouped into one generation The industry has developed a razor and blades model manufacturers often sell consoles at low prices sometimes at a loss while primarily making a profit from the licensing fees for each game sold Planned obsolescence then draws consumers into buying the next console generation While numerous manufacturers have come and gone in the history of the console market there have always been two or three dominant leaders in the market with the current market led by Sony with their PlayStation brand Microsoft with their Xbox brand and Nintendo currently producing the Switch 2 and Switch consoles Previous console developers include Sega Atari Cole co Mattel NEC SNK Magna vox Philips and Panasonic The first video game consoles were produced in the early 1970 s Ralph H Baer devised the concept of playing simple spot based games on a television screen in 1966 which later became the basis of the Magna vox Odyssey in 1972 Inspired by the table tennis game on the Odyssey Nolan Bushnell Ted D abney and Allan Al corn at Atari Inc developed the first successful arcade game Pong and looked to develop that into a home version which was released in 1975 The first consoles were capable of playing only a very limited number of games built into the hardware Programmable consoles using swap p able ROM cartridges were introduced with the Fairchild Channel Fin 1976 though popularized with the Atari 2600 released in 1977 Handheld consoles emerged from technology improvements in handheld electronic games as these shifted from mechanical to electronic digital logic and away from light emitting diode LED indicators to liquid crystal displays LCD that resembled video screens more closely Early examples include the Micro vision in 1979 and Game Watch in 1980 and the concept was fully realized by the Game Boy in 1989 Both home and handheld consoles have become more advanced following global changes in technology These technological shifts include improved electronic and computer chip manufacturing to increase computational power at lower costs and size the introduction of 3 D graphics and hardware based graphic processors for real time rendering digital communications such as the Internet wireless networking and Bluetooth and larger and denser media formats as well as digital distribution Following the same type of Moore's law progression home consoles are grouped into generations each lasting approximately five years Consoles within each generation share similar specifications and features such as processor word size While no one grouping of consoles by generation is universally accepted 2 a breakdown of generations showing representative consoles of each is shown below Home video game consoles are meant to be connected to a television or other type of monitor with power supplied through an outlet This requires the unit to be used in a fixed location typically at home in one's living room Separate game controllers connected through wired or wireless connections are used to provide input to the game Early examples include the Atari 2600 the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis newer examples include the Wii U the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X A micro console is a home video game console that is typically powered by low cost computing hardware making the console lower priced compared to other home consoles on the market The majority of micro consoles with a few exceptions such as the PlayStation TV and On Live Game System are Android based digital media players that are bundled with gamepad s and marketed as gaming devices Such micro consoles can be connected to the television to play video games downloaded from an application store such as Google Play 3 Handheld game consoles are devices that typically include a built in screen and game controller in their case and contain a rechargeable battery or battery compartment This allows the unit to be carried around and played anywhere in contrast to a home game console Examples include the Game Boy the PlayStation Portable and the Nintendo 3 DS Hybrid video game consoles are devices that combine the use as either a handheld or a home console In addition to handheld consoles they generally also have either a wired connection or docking station that connects the console unit to a television screen The consoles can be used as separate controllers only and be played during wired battery charging Handheld s include the Sega Nomad PlayStation Portable and Nvidia's Shield Portable and Shield Tablet or home consoles such as the Wii U have hybrid features 4 With the Nintendo Switch a console with detachable controllers called Joy C onSet the hybrid term became popular and is considered by some to be the first truly hybrid console 5 6 Most consoles are considered programmable consoles and have the means for the player to switch between different games Traditionally this has been done by switching a physical game cartridge or game card or by using optical media It is now common to download games through digital distribution and store them on internal or external digital storage devices Some consoles are considered dedicated consoles in which games available for the console are baked on to the hardware either by being programmed via the circuitry or set in the read only flash memory of the console Thus the console's game library cannot be added to or changed directly by the user The user can typically switch between games on dedicated consoles using hardware switches on the console or through in game menus Dedicated consoles were common in the first generation of home consoles such as the Magna vox Odyssey and the home console version of Pong and more recently have been used for retro style consoles such as the NES Classic Edition and Sega Genesis Mini Dedicated consoles were very popular in the first generation until they were gradually replaced by second generation that use ROM cartridges The fourth generation gradually merged with optical media During the later part of video game history there have been specialized consoles using computing components to offer multiple games to players Most of these plug directly into one's television and thus are often called plug and play consoles Most of them are also considered dedicated consoles since it is generally impossible to access the computing components by an average consumer though tech savvy consumers often have found ways to hack the console to install additional functionality voiding the manufacturer's warranty Plug and play consoles usually come with the console unit itself one or more controllers and the required components for power and video hookup Many recent plug and play releases have been for distributing a number of retro games for a specific console platform Examples of these include the Atari Flashback series the NES Classic Edition Sega Genesis Mini 7 and also handheld retro consoles such as the Nintendo Game Watch color screen series Early console hardware was designed as customized printed circuit boards PCB s selecting existing integrated circuit chips that performed known functions or programmable chips like erasable programmable read only memory E PROM chips that could perform certain functions Persistent computer memory was expensive so dedicated consoles were generally limited to the use of processor registers for storage of the state of a game thus limiting the complexities of such titles non sequitur registers are not persistent memory Pong in both its arcade and home format had a handful of logic and calculation chips that used the current input of the players ' paddles and registers storing the ball's position to update the game's state and send it to the display device 8 Even with more advanced integrated circuits IC s of the time designers were limited to what could be done through the electrical process rather than through programming as normally associated with video game development Improvements in console hardware followed with improvements in microprocessor technology and semiconductor device fabrication 9 Manufacturing processes have been able to reduce the feature size on chips typically measured in nanometers allowing more transistors and other components to fit on a chip and at the same time increasing the circuit speeds and the potential frequency the chip can run at as well as reducing thermal dissipation Chips were able to be made on larger dies further increasing the number of features and effective processing power Random access memory became more practical with the higher density of transistors per chip but to address the correct blocks of memory processors needed to be updated to use larger word sizes and allot for larger bandwidth in chip communications 9 All these improvements did increase the cost of manufacturing but at a rate far less than the gains in overall processing power which helped to make home computers and consoles inexpensive for the consumer all related to Moore's law of technological improvements 9 For the consoles of the 1980 s to 1990 s these improvements were evident in the marketing in the late 1980 s to 1990 s during the bit wars where console manufacturers had focused on their console's processor's word size as a selling point 10 Consoles since the 2000 s are more similar to personal computers building in memory storage features and networking capabilities to avoid the limitations of the past 11 The confluence with personal computers eased software development for both computer and console games allowing developers to target both platforms However consoles differ from computers as most of the hardware components are pre selected and customized between the console manufacturer and hardware component provider to assure a consistent performance target for developers Whereas personal computer motherboards are designed with the needs for allowing consumers to add their desired selection of hardware components the fixed set of hardware for consoles enables console manufacturers to optimize the size and design of the motherboard and hardware often integrating key hardware components into the motherboard circuitry itself Often multiple components such as the central processing unit and graphics processing unit can be combined into a single chip otherwise known as a system on a chip SoC which is a further reduction in size and cost 12 In addition consoles tend to focus on components that give the unit high game performance such as the CPU and GPU and as a tradeoff to keep their prices in expected ranges use less memory and storage space compared to typical personal computers 13 In comparison to the early years of the industry where most consoles were made directly by the company selling the console many consoles of today are generally constructed through a value chain that includes component suppliers such as AMD and NVidia for CPU and GPU functions and contract manufacturers including electronics manufacturing services factories which assemble those components into the final consoles such as Fox conn and Flex tronic s Completed consoles are then usually tested distributed and repaired by the company itself 14 Microsoft and Nintendo both use this approach to their consoles while Sony maintains all production in house with the exception of their component suppliers Some of the commons elements that can be found within console hardware include All game consoles require player input through a game controller to provide a method to move the player character in a specific direction and a variation of buttons to perform other in game actions such as jumping or interacting with the game world 21 Though controllers have become more featured over the years they still provide less control over a game compared to personal computers or mobile gaming 22 The type of controller available to a game can fundamentally change the style of how a console game will or can be played 23 24 25 However this has also inspired changes in game design to create games that accommodate for the comparatively limited controls available on consoles 26 Controllers have come in a variety of styles over the history of consoles Some common types include Numerous other controller types exist including those that support motion controls touchscreen support on handheld s and some consoles and specialized controllers for specific types of games such as racing wheels for racing games light guns for shooting games and musical instrument controllers for rhythm games Some newer consoles also include optional support for a mouse and keyboard devices Some older consoles such as 1988 Sega Genesis aka Mega Drive and 19933 DO Interactive Multiplayer supported optional mice both with special mice made for them but the 3 DO mouse like that console was a flop and the mouse for the Sega had very limited game support The Sega also supported the optional Menace r a wireless infrared light gun and such were at one point popular for games It also support Batter UP a baseball bat shaped controller A controller may be attached through a wired connection on to the console itself or in some unique cases like the Famicom hard wired to the console or with a wireless connection Controllers require power either provided by the console via the wired connection or from batteries or a rechargeable battery pack for wireless connections Controllers are nominally built into a handheld unit though some newer ones allow for separate wireless controllers to also be used While the first game consoles were dedicated game systems with the games programmed into the console's hardware the Fairchild Channel F introduced the ability to store games in a form separate from the console's internal circuitry thus allowing the consumer to purchase new games to play on the system Since the Channel F nearly all game consoles have featured the ability to purchase and swap games through some form through those forms have changes with improvements in technology While magnetic storage such as tape drives and floppy disks had been popular for software distribution with early personal computers in the 1980 s and 1990 s this format did not see much use in console systems There were some attempts such as the Ball y Astro cade and APF M 1000 using tape drives as well as the Disk System for the Nintendo Famicom 31 and the Nintendo 64 DD for the Nintendo 64 but these had limited applications as magnetic media was more fragile and volatile than game cartridges 32 In addition to built in internal storage newer consoles often give the consumer the ability to use external storage media to save game data downloaded games or other media files from the console Early iterations of external storage were achieved through the use of flash based memory cards first used by the Neo Geo but popularized with the PlayStation Nintendo continues to support this approach with extending the storage capabilities of the 3 DS and Switch standardizing on the currentS D card format As consoles began incorporating the use of USB ports support for USB external hard drives was also added such as with the Xbox 360 With Internet enabled consoles console manufacturers offer both free and paid subscription services that provide value added services a top the basic functions of the console Free services generally offer user identity services and access to a digital storefront while paid services allow players to play online games interact with other uses through social networking use cloud saves for supported games and gain access to free titles on a rotating basis Examples of such services include the Xbox network PlayStation Network and Nintendo Switch Online Certain consoles saw various add on s or accessories that were designed to attach to the existing console to extend its functionality The best example of this was through the various CD ROM add on s for consoles of the fourth generation such as the TurboGrafx CD Atari Jaguar CD and the Sega CD Other examples of add on s include the 32 X for the Sega Genesis intended to allow owners of the aging console to play newer games but has several technical faults and the Game Boy Player for the GameCube to allow it to play Game Boy games Consumers can often purchase a range of accessories for consoles outside of the above categories These can include The core development process for a console game is very similar to its counterparts and primarily differs in the high level concept due to demographics 33 and the technical back end 34 Consoles developers will usually make a development kit available to game developers which they can use to test their games on with more ease than a consumer model Early console games were commonly created by a single person and could be changed in a short amount of time due to the simplicity of the games at the time 35 As technology has improved the development time complexity and cost of console games has increased dramatically 36 to where the size of a team for an eighth generation game can number in the hundreds 37 Similarly the programming languages used in video game development has changed over time with early games being developed primarily in assembly As time went on developers had more choice on what they could use based on the availability on the console but some languages became more popular than others 36 In comparison to PC and mobile games console game developers must consider the limitations of the hardware their game is being developed for as it is unlikely to have any major changes between the development phase and release PC and mobile technology progresses quickly and there are many different configurations of their hardware and software This is beneficial at the start of a console's life cycle as the technology will be cutting edge but as the console ages developers are forced to work with ageing hardware until the next generation of consoles is released Earlier consoles games could be developed to take advantage of the fixed limitations of the consoles they were developed for such as the Mega Drive's capability of fast scrolling influencing design decisions made for Sonic the Hedgehog 38 Console or game development kits are specialized hardware units that typically include the same components as the console and additional chips and components to allow the unit to be connected to a computer or other monitoring device for debugging purposes A console manufacturer will make the console's dev kit available to registered developers months ahead of the console's planned launch to give developers time to prepare their games for the new system These initial kits will usually be offered under special confidentiality clauses to protect trade secrets of the console's design and will be sold at a high cost to the developer as part of keeping this confidentiality 13 Newer consoles that share features in common with personal computers may no longer use specialized dev kits though developers are still expected to register and purchase access to software development kits from the manufacturer For example any consumer Xbox One can be used for game development after paying a fee to Microsoft to register one intent to do so 39 Since the release of the Nintendo Famicom Nintendo Entertainment System most video game console manufacturers employ a strict licensing scheme that limit what games can be developed for it Developers and their publishers must pay a fee typically based on royalty per unit sold back to the manufacturer The cost varies by manufacturer but was estimated to be aboutUS 3 10 per unit in 2012 With additional fees such as branding rights this has generally worked out to be an industry wide 30 royalty rate paid to the console manufacturer for every game sold 40 41 This is in addition to the cost of acquiring the dev kit to develop for the system The licensing fee may be collected in a few different ways In the case of Nintendo the company generally has controlled the production of game cartridges with its lockout chips and optical media for its systems and thus charges the developer or publisher for each copy it makes as an upfront fee This also allows Nintendo to review the game's content prior to release and veto games it does not believe appropriate to include on its system This had led to over 700 unlicensed games for the NES 42 and numerous others on other Nintendo cartridge based systems that had found ways to bypass the hardware lockout chips and sell without paying any royalties to Nintendo such as by Atari in its subsidiary company Ten gen 43 This licensing approach was similarly used by most other cartridge based console manufacturers using lockout chip technology 44 With optical media where the console manufacturer may not have direct control on the production of the media the developer or publisher typically must establish a licensing agreement to gain access to the console's proprietary storage format for the media as well as to use the console and manufacturer's logos and branding for the game's packaging paid back through royalties on sales 40 In the transition to digital distribution where now the console manufacturer runs digital storefronts for games license fees apply to registering a game for distribution on the storefront again gaining access to the console's branding and logo with the manufacturer taking its cut of each sale as its royalty 40 In both cases this still gives console manufacturers the ability to review and reject games it believes unsuitable for the system and deny licensing rights With the rise of indie game development the major console manufacturers have all developed entry level routes for these smaller developers to be able to publish on to consoles at far lower costs and reduced royalty rates Programs like Microsoft's ID Xbox give developers most of the needed tools for free after validating the small development size and needs of the team 45 Similar licensing concepts apply for third party accessory manufacturers 40 Consoles like most consumer electronic devices have limited lifespans There is great interest in preservation of older console hardware for archival and historical purposes as games from older consoles as well as arcade and personal computers remain of interest Computer programmers and hackers have developed emulators that can be run on personal computers or other consoles that simulate the hardware of older consoles that allow games from that console to be run The development of software emulators of console hardware is established to be legal but there are unanswered legal questions surrounding copyrights including acquiring a console's firmware and copies of a game's ROM image which laws such as the United States ' Digital Millennium Copyright Act make illegal save for certain archival purposes 46 Even though emulation itself is legal Nintendo is recognized to be highly protective of any attempts to emulate its systems and has taken early legal actions to shut down such projects 47 To help support older games and console transitions manufacturers started to support backward compatibility on consoles in the same family Sony was the first to do this on a home console with the PlayStation 2 which was able to play original PlayStation content and subsequently became a sought after feature across many consoles that followed 48 Backward compatibility functionality has included direct support for previous console games on the newer consoles such as within the Xbox console family 49 the distribution of emulated games such as Nintendo's Virtual Console or using cloud gaming services for these older games as with the PlayStation Now service Consoles may be shipped in a variety of configurations but typically will include one base configuration that include the console one controller and sometimes a pack in game Manufacturers may offer alternate stock keeping unit SK Us options that include additional controllers and accessories or different pack in games Special console editions may feature unique cases or face plates with art dedicated to a specific video game or series and are bundled with that game as a special incentive for its fans Pack in games are typically first party games often featuring the console's primary mascot characters 50 The more recent console generations have also seen multiple versions of the same base console system either offered at launch or presented as a mid generation refresh In some cases these simply replace some parts of the hardware with cheaper or more efficient parts or otherwise streamline the console's design for production going forward the PlayStation 3 underwent several such hardware refreshes during its lifetime due to technological improvements such as significant reduction of the process node size for the CPU and GPU 51 In these cases the hardware revision model will be marked on packaging so that consumers can verify which version they are acquiring 52 In other cases the hardware changes create multiple lines within the same console family The base console unit in all revisions share fundamental hardware but options like internal storage space and RAM size may be different Those systems with more storage and RAM would be marked as a higher performance variant available at a higher cost while the original unit would remain as a budget option For example within the Xbox One family Microsoft released the mid generation Xbox One X as a higher performance console the Xbox One S as the lower cost base console and a special Xbox One S All Digital Edition revision that removed the optical drive on the basis that users could download all games digitally offered at even a lower cost than the Xbox One S In these cases developers can often optimize games to work better on the higher performance console with patches to the retail version of the game 53 In the case of the Nintendo 3 DS the New Nintendo 3 DS featured upgraded memory and processors with new games that could only be run on the upgraded units and cannot be run on an older base unit 54 There have also been a number of slimmed down console options with significantly reduced hardware components that significantly reduced the price they could sell the console to the consumer but either leaving certain features off the console such as the Wii Mini that lacked any online components compared to the Wii or that required the consumer to purchase additional accessories and wiring if they did not already own it such as the New Style NES that was not bundled with the required RF hardware to connect to a television 55 Consoles when originally launched in the 1970 s and 1980 s were aboutUS 200 300 56 and with the introduction of the ROM cartridge each game averaged aboutUS 30 40 63 Over time the launch price of base consoles units has generally risen to aboutUS 400 500 56 with the average game costing US 60 63 Exceptionally the period of transition from ROM cartridges to optical media in the early 1990 s saw several consoles with high price points exceeding US 400 and going as high asUS 700 Resultingly sales of these first optical media consoles were generally poor 56 When adjusted for inflation the price of consoles has generally followed a downward trend from US 800 1 000 from the early generations down to US 500 600 for current consoles This is typical for any computer technology with the improvements in computing performance and capabilities out pacing the additional costs to achieve those gains 56 Further within the United States the price of consoles has generally remained consistent being within 0 8 to 1 of the median household income based on the United States Census data for the console's launch year 56 Since the Nintendo Entertainment System console pricing has stabilized on the razor blade model where the consoles are sold at little to no profit for the manufacturer but they gain revenue from each game sold due to console licensing fees and other value added services around the console such as Xbox Live 47 64 65 Console manufacturers have even been known to take losses on the sale of consoles at the start of a console's launch with expectation to recover with revenue sharing and later price recovery on the console as they switch to less expensive components and manufacturing processes without changing the retail price 66 Consoles have been generally designed to have a five year product lifetime though manufacturers have considered their entries in the more recent generations to have longer lifetimes of seven to potentially ten years 67 The competition within the video game console market as subset of the video game industry is an area of interest to economics with its relatively modern history its rapid growth to rival that of the film industry and frequent changes compared to other sectors 57 11 Effects of unregulated competition on the market were twice seen early in the industry The industry had its first crash in 1977 following the release of the Magna vox Odyssey Atari's home versions of Pong and the Cole co Telstar which led other third party manufacturers using inexpensive General Instruments processor chips to make their own home consoles which flooded the market by 1977 68 81 89 The video game crash of 1983 was fueled by multiple factors including competition from lower cost personal computers but unregulated competition was also a factor as numerous third party game developers attempting to follow on the success of Activision in developing third party games for the Atari 2600 and Intellivision flooded the market with poor quality games and made it difficult for even quality games to sell 69 Nintendo implemented a lockout chip the Checking Integrated Circuit on releasing the Nintendo Entertainment System in Western territories as a means to control which games were published for the console As part of their licensing agreements Nintendo further prevented developers from releasing the same game on a different console for a period of two years This served as one of the first means of securing console exclusivity for games that existed beyond technical limitation of console development 70 The Nintendo Entertainment System also brought the concept of a video game mascot as the representation of a console system as a means to sell and promote the unit and for the NES was Mario The use of mascots in businesses had been a tradition in Japan and this had already proven successful in arcade games like Pac Man Mario was used to serve as an identity for the NES as a humor filled playful console 50 71 Mario caught on quickly when the NES released in the West and when the next generation of consoles arrived other manufacturers pushed their own mascots to the forefront of their marketing most notably Sega with the use of Sonic the Hedgehog 72 The Nintendo and Sega rivalry that involved their mascot's flagship games served as part of the fourth console generation's console wars Since then manufacturers have typically positioned their mascot and other first party games as key titles in console bundles used to drive sales of consoles at launch or at key sales periods such as near Christmas 50 Another type of competitive edge used by console manufacturers around the same time was the notion of bits or the size of the word used by the main CPU The TurboGrafx 16 was the first console to push on its bit size advertising itself as a 16 bit console though this only referred to part of its architecture while its CPU was still an 8 bit unit Despite this manufacturers found consumers became fixated on the notion of bits as a console selling point and over the fourth fifth and sixth generation these bit wars played heavily into console advertising 10 The use of bits waned as CPU architectures no longer needed to increase their word size and instead had other means to improve performance such as through multicore CPUs 10 Generally increased console numbers gives rise to more consumer options and better competition but the exclusivity of titles made the choice of console for consumers an all or nothing decision for most 11 Further with the number of available consoles growing with the fifth and sixth generations game developers became pressured to which systems to focus on and ultimately narrowed their target choice of platforms to those that were the best selling This cased a contraction in the market with major players like Sega leaving the hardware business after the Dreamcast but continuing in the software area 57 Effectively each console generation was shown to have two or three dominant players 11 Competition in the console market in the 2010 s and 2020 s is considered an oligopoly between three main manufacturers Nintendo Sony and Microsoft The three use a combination of first party games exclusive to their console and negotiate exclusive agreements with third party developers to have their games be exclusive for at least an initial period of time to drive consumers to their console They also worked with CPU and GPU manufacturers to tune and customize hardware for computers to make it more amenable and effective for video games leading to lower cost hardware needed for video game consoles Finally console manufacturers also work with retailers to help with promotion of consoles games and accessories While there is little difference in pricing on the console hardware from the manufacturer's suggested retail price for the retailer to profit from these details with the manufacturers can secure better profits on sales of game and accessory bundles for premier product placement 57 These all form network effects with each manufacturer seeking to maximize the size of their network of partners to increase their overall position in the competition 11 Of the three Microsoft and Sony both with their own hardware manufacturing capabilities remain at a leading edge approach attempting to gain a first mover advantage over the other with adaption of new console technology 57 Nintendo is more reliant on its suppliers and thus instead of trying to compete feature for feature with Microsoft and Sony had instead taken a blue ocean strategy since the Nintendo DS and Wii 73",

launch give developer time prepare game new system initial kit usually offer special confidentiality clause protect trade secret console design sell high cost developer part keep confidentiality newer console share feature common personal computer may longer use specialized dev kit though developer still expect register purchase access software development kit manufacturer example consumer xbox one use game development pay fee microsoft register one intent since release nintendo famicom nintendo entertainment system video game console manufacturer employ strict licensing scheme limit game develop developer publisher must pay fee typically base royalty per unit sell back manufacturer cost varies manufacturer estimate aboutus per unit additional fee brand right generally work industry wide royalty rate pay console manufacturer every game sell addition cost acquire dev kit develop system license fee may collect different way case nintendo company generally control production game cartridges lockout chip optical medium system thus charge developer publisher copy make upfront fee also allow nintendo review game content prior release veto game not believe appropriate include system lead unlicensed game nes numerous others nintendo cartridge base system find way bypass hardware lockout chip sell without pay royalty nintendo atari subsidiary company ten gen license approach similarly use cartridge base console manufacturer use lockout chip technology optical medium console manufacturer may not direct control production medium developer publisher typically must establish licensing agreement gain access console proprietary storage format medium well use console manufacturer logos brand game package pay back royalty sale transition digital distribution console manufacturer run digital storefront game license fee apply register game distribution storefront gain access console brand logo manufacturer take cut sale royalty case still give console manufacturer ability review reject game believe unsuitable system deny license right rise indie game development major console manufacturer develop entry level route small developer able publish console far low cost reduce royalty rate program like microsofts xbox give developer need tool free validate small development size need team similar licensing concept apply third party accessory manufacturer console like consumer electronic device limit lifespans great interest preservation old console hardware archival historical purpose game old console well arcade personal computer remain interest computer programmer hacker develop emulator run personal computer console simulate hardware old console allow game console run development software emulator console hardware establish legal unanswered legal question surround copyright include acquire console firmware copy game rom image law united state digital millennium copyright act make illegal save certain archival purpose even though emulation legal nintendo recognize highly protective attempt emulate system take early legal action shut project help support old game console transition manufacturer start support backward compatibility console family sony first home console playstation able play original playstation content subsequently become sought feature across many console follow backward compatibility functionality include

variety configuration typically include one base configuration include console one controller sometimes pack game manufacturer may offer alternate stock keep unit option include additional controller accessory different pack game special console edition may feature unique case face plate art dedicate specific video game series bundle game special incentive fan pack game typically first party game often feature console primary mascot character recent console generation also see multiple version base console system either offer launch present mid generation refresh case simply replace part hardware cheaper efficient part otherwise streamline console design production go forward playstation underwent several hardware refreshes lifetime due technological improvement significant reduction process node size cpu gpu case hardware revision model mark package consumer verify version acquire case hardware change create multiple line within console family base console unit revision share fundamental hardware option like internal storage space ram size may different system storage ram would mark high performance variant available high cost original unit would remain budget option example within xbox one family microsoft release mid generation xbox one high performance console xbox one low cost base console special xbox one digital edition revision remove optical drive basis user could download game digitally offer even low cost xbox one case developer often optimize game work well high performance console patch retail version game case nintendo new nintendo feature upgraded memory processor new game could run upgraded unit cannot run old base unit also number slimmed console option significantly reduce hardware component significantly reduce price could sell console consumer either leave certain feature console wii mini lack online component compare wii required consumer purchase additional accessory wire not already new style ne not bundle require

period transition rom cartridges optical medium early saw several console high price point exceed go high asus resultingly sale first optical medium console generally poor adjusted inflation price console generally follow downward trend early generation current console typical computer technology improvement compute performance capability pace additional cost achieve gain within united state price console generally remain consistent within median household income base united state census data console launch year since nintendo entertainment system console pricing stabilize razor blade model console sell little profit manufacturer gain revenue game sell due console licensing fee value add service around console xbox live console manufacturer even know take loss sale console start console launch expectation recover revenue share late price recovery console switch less expensive component manufacture process without change retail price console generally design five year product lifetime though manufacturer consider entry recent generation longer lifetimes seven potentially ten year competition within video game console market subset video game industry area interest economics relatively modern history rapid growth rival film industry frequent change compare sector effect unregulated competition market twice see early industry industry first crash follow release magna vox odyssey ataris home version pong cole telstar lead third party manufacturer use inexpensive general instrument processor chip make home console flood market video game crash fuel multiple factor include competition low cost personal computer unregulated competition also factor numerous third party game developer attempt follow success activision develop third party game atari intellivision flood market poor quality game make difficult even quality game sell nintendo implement lockout chip check integrate circuit release nintendo entertainment system western territory mean control game publish console part license agreement nintendo prevent developer release game different console period two year serve one first mean secure console exclusivity game exist beyond technical limitation console development nintendo entertainment system also bring concept video game mascot representation console system mean sell promote unit ne mario use mascots business tradition japan already proven successful arcade game like pac man mario use serve identity ne humor fill playful console mario catch quickly ne release west next generation console arrive manufacturer push mascot forefront marketing notably sega use sonic hedgehog nintendo sega rivalry involve mascot flagship game serve part fourth console generation console war since manufacturer typically position mascot first party game key title console bundle use drive sale console launch key sale period near christmas another type competitive edge use console manufacturer around time notion bit size word use main cpu turbografx first console push bit size advertising bit console though referred part architecture cpu still bit unit despite manufacturer find consumer become fixated notion bit console sell point fourth fifth sixth generation bit war play heavily console advertising use bit wan cpu architecture longer needed increase word size instead mean improve performance multicore cpu generally increase console number give rise consumer option good competition exclusivity title make choice console consumer nothing decision number available console grow fifth sixth generation game developer become pressured system focus ultimately narrow target choice platform best sell cased contraction market major player like sega leave hardware business dreamcast continue software area effectively console generation show two three dominant player competition console market consider oligopoly three main manufacturer nintendo sony microsoft three use combination first party game exclusive console negotiate exclusive agreement third party developer game exclusive least initial period time drive consumer console also work cpu gpu manufacturer tune customize hardware computer make amenable effective video game lead low cost hardware need video game console finally console manufacturer also work retailer help promotion console game accessory little difference pricing console hardware manufacturer suggest retail price retailer profit detail manufacturer secure good profit sale game accessory bundle premier product placement form network effect manufacturer seek maximize size network partner increase overall position competition three microsoft sony hardware manufacture capability remain leading edge approach attempt gain first mover advantage adaption new console
