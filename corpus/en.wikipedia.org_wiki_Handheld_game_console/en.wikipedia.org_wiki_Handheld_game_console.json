    "transformers_text": "A handheld game console or simply handheld console is a small portable self contained video game console with a built in screen game controls and speakers 1 Handheld game consoles are smaller than home video game consoles and contain the console screen speakers and controls in one unit allowing players to carry them and play them at any time or place 2 3 In 1976 Mattel introduced the first handheld electronic game with the release of Auto Race 4 Later several companies including Cole co and Milton Bradley made their own single game lightweight table top or handheld electronic game devices 5 The first commercially successful handheld console was Merlin from 1978 which sold more than 5 million units 6 The first handheld game console with interchangeable cartridges is the Milton Bradley Micro vision in 1979 7 Nintendo is credited with popularizing the handheld console concept with the release of the Game Boy in 1989 3 and continues to dominate the handheld console market 8 9 The first internet enabled handheld console and the first with a touchscreen was the Game com released by Tiger Electronics in 1997 10 The Nintendo DS released in 2004 introduced touchscreen controls and wireless online gaming to a wider audience becoming the best selling handheld console with over 150 million units sold worldwide 11 This table describes handheld games consoles by generation with over 1 million sales No handheld achieved this prior to the fourth generation of game consoles This list does not include dedicated consoles such as LCD games and the Tamagotchi 10 36 million The origins of handheld game consoles are found in handheld and table top electronic game devices of the 1970 s and early 1980 s These electronic devices are capable of playing only a single game 3 they fit in the palm of the hand or on a table top and they may make use of a variety of video displays such as LED VFD or LCD 13 In 1978 handheld electronic games were described by Popular Electronics magazine as non video electronic games and non TV games as distinct from devices that required use of a television screen 14 Handheld electronic games in turn find their origins in the synthesis citation needed of previous handheld and table top electro mechanical devices such as Waco's Electronic Tic Tac Toe 1972 13 Crags tan's Periscope Firing Range 1951 15 and the emerging op to electronic display driven calculator market of the early 1970 s 16 17 This synthesis happened in 1976 when Mattel began work on a line of calculator sized sports games that became the world's first handheld electronic games The project began when Michael Katz Mattel's new product category marketing director told the engineers in the electronics group to design a game the size of a calculator using LED light emitting diode technology 18 The result was the 1976 release of Auto Race 19 Followed by Football later in 1977 20 21 the two games were so successful that according to Katz these simple electronic handheld games turned into a ' 400 million category ' 13 Mattel would later win the honor of being recognized by the industry for innovation in handheld game device displays 22 Soon other manufacturers including Cole co Parker Brothers Milton Bradley En tex and Bandai 5 began following up with their own table top and handheld electronic games In 1979 the LCD based Micro vision designed by Smith Engineering and distributed by Milton Bradley 23 became the first handheld game console and the first to use interchangeable game cartridges 7 The Micro vision game Cosmic Hunter 1981 also introduced the concept of a directional pad on handheld gaming devices 24 and is operated by using the thumb to manipulate the on screen character in any of four directions 25 In 1979 Gunpei Yokoi traveling on a bullet train saw a bored businessman playing with an LCD calculator by pressing the buttons Yokoi then thought of an idea for a watch that doubled as a miniature game machine for killing time 26 Starting in 1980 Nintendo began to release a series of electronic games designed by Yokoi called the Game Watch games 27 Taking advantage of the technology used in the credit card sized calculators that had appeared on the market Yokoi designed the series of LCD based games to include a digital time display in the corner of the screen 28 For later more complicated Game Watch games Yokoi invented a cross shaped directional pad or D pad for control of on screen characters 29 Yokoi also included his directional pad on the NES controllers and the cross shaped thumb controller soon became standard on game console controllers and ubiquitous across the video game industry since 30 31 When Yokoi began designing Nintendo's first handheld game console he came up with a device that married the elements of his Game Watch devices and the Famicom console 32 including both items ' D pad controller The result was the Nintendo Game Boy In 1982 the Bandai LCD Solar power was the first solar powered gaming device Some of its games such as the horror themed game Terror House features two LCD panels one stacked on the other for an early 3 D effect 33 In 1983 Ta kara To my's To my tronic 3 D simulates 3 D by having two LCD panels that were lit by external light through a window on top of the device making it the first dedicated home video 3 D hardware 34 The late 1980 s and early 1990 s saw the beginnings of the modern day handheld game console industry after the demise of the Micro vision As backlit LCD game consoles with color graphics consume a lot of power they were not battery friendly like the non backlit original Game Boy whose monochrome graphics allowed longer battery life By this point rechargeable battery technology had not yet matured and so the more advanced game consoles of the time such as the Sega Game Gear and Atari Lynx did not have nearly as much success as the Game Boy Even though third party rechargeable batteries were available for the battery hungry alternatives to the Game Boy these batteries employed a nickel cadmium process and had to be completely discharged before being recharged to ensure maximum efficiency lead acid batteries could be used with automobile circuit limit ers cigarette lighter plug devices but the batteries had mediocre portability The later NiMH batteries which do not share this requirement for maximum efficiency were not released until the late 1990 s years after the Game Gear Atari Lynx and original Game Boy had been discontinued During the time when technologically superior handheld s had strict technical limitations batteries had a very low mAh rating since batteries with heavy power density were not yet available Modern game systems such as the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable have rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries with proprietary shapes Other seventh generation consoles such as the GP 2 X use standard alkaline batteries Because the mAh rating of alkaline batteries has increased since the 1990 s the power needed for handheld s like the GP 2 X may be supplied by relatively few batteries Nintendo released the Game Boy on April 21 1989 September 1990 for the UK The design team headed by Gunpei Yokoi had also been responsible for the Game Watch system as well as the Nintendo Entertainment System games Metroid and Kid Icarus The Game Boy came under scrutiny by Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi saying that the monochrome screen was too small and the processing power was inadequate The design team had felt that low initial cost and battery economy were more important concerns and when compared to the Micro vision the Game Boy was a huge leap forward Yokoi recognized that the Game Boy needed a killer app at least one game that would define the console and persuade customers to buy it In June 1988 Minoru Arakawa then CEO of Nintendo of America saw a demonstration of the game Tetris at a trade show Nintendo purchased the rights for the game and packaged it with the Game Boy system as a launch title It was almost an immediate hit By the end of the year more than a million units were sold in the US 35 As of March 31 2005 the Game Boy and Game Boy Color combined to sell over 118 million units worldwide 36 37 In 1987 E pyx created the Handy Game a device that would become the Atari Lynx in 1989 It was the first color handheld console ever made as well as the first with a backlit screen It also featured networking support with up to 17 other players and advanced hardware that allowed the zooming and scaling of sprites The Lynx could also be turned upside down to accommodate left handed players However all of these features came at a high price point which drove consumers to seek cheaper alternatives The Lynx was also unwieldy consumed batteries quickly and lacked the third party support enjoyed by its competitors Due to its high price short battery life production shortages a dearth of compelling games and Nintendo's aggressive marketing campaign and despite a redesign in 1991 the Lynx became a commercial failure Despite this companies like Tele games helped to keep the system alive long past its commercial relevance and when new owner Hasbro released the rights to develop for the public domain independent developers like Songbird have managed to release new commercial games for the system every year until 2004's Winter Games The Turbo Express was a portable version of the TurboGrafx released in 1990 for 249 99 Its Japanese equivalent was the PC Engine GT It was the most advanced handheld of its time and could play all the TurboGrafx 16's games which are on a small credit card sized media called Hu Cards It had a 66 mm 2 6 in screen the same as the original Game Boy but in a much higher resolution and could display 64 sprites at once 16 per s can line in 512 colors although the hardware could only handle 481 simultaneous colors It had 8 kilobytes of RAM The Turbo ran on the Hu C 6820 CPU at 1 79 or 7 16 MHz The optional Turbo Vision TV tuner included an RCA audio video input allowing users to use Turbo Express as a video monitor The Turbo Link allowed two player play Falcon a flight simulator included a head to head dogfight mode that could only be accessed via Turbo Link However very few TG 16 games offered co op play modes especially designed with the Turbo Express in mind The Bit corp Ga mate was one of the first handheld game systems created in response to the Nintendo Game Boy It was released in Asia in 1990 and distributed worldwide by 1991 Like the Sega Game Gear it was horizontal in orientation and like the Game Boy required 4 A A batteries Unlike many later Game Boy clones its internal components were professionally assembled no glop top chips Unfortunately the system's fatal flaw was its screen Even by the standards of the day its screen was rather difficult to use suffering from similar ghosting problems that were common complaints with the first generation Game Boys Likely because of this fact sales were quite poor and Bit corp closed by 1992 However new games continued to be published for the Asian market possibly as late as 1994 The total number of games released for the system remains unknown Ga mate games were designed for stereo sound but the console was only equipped with a mono speaker The Game Gear was the first color handheld console produced by Sega Released in Japan in 1990 and in North America and Europe in 1991 it was based on the Master System which gave Sega the ability to quickly create Game Gear games from its large library of games for the Master System While never reaching the level of success enjoyed by Nintendo the Game Gear proved to be a fairly durable competitor lasting longer than any other Game Boy rivals While the Game Gear was most frequently seen in black or navy blue it was also released in a variety of additional colors red light blue yellow violet and transparent All of these variations were released in small quantities and frequently only in the Asian market Following Sega's success with the Game Gear they began development on a successor during the early 1990 s which was intended to feature a touchscreen interface many years before the Nintendo DS However such a technology was very expensive at the time and the handheld itself was estimated to have cost around 289 were it to be released Sega eventually chose to shelve the idea and instead release the Genesis Nomad a handheld version of the Genesis as the successor 38 The Wa tara SuperVision was released in 1992 in an attempt to compete with the Nintendo Game Boy The first model was designed very much like a Game Boy but was grey in color and had a slightly larger screen The second model was made with a hinge across the center and could be bent slightly to provide greater comfort for the user While the system did enjoy a modest degree of success it never impacted the sales of Nintendo or Sega The SuperVision was redesigned a final time as The Magnum Released in limited quantities it was roughly equivalent to the Game Boy Pocket It was available in three colors yellow green and grey Wa tara designed many of the games themselves but did receive some third party support most notably from S a chen A TV adapter was available in both PAL and NTSC formats that could transfer the Supervision's black and white palette to 4 colors similar in some regards to the Super Game Boy from Nintendo The Hart ung Game Master was an obscure handheld released at an unknown point in the early 1990 s Its graphics fidelity was much lower than most of its contemporaries displaying just 64 x 64 pixels It was available in black white and purple and was frequently rebranded by its distributors such as Del play Video jet and System a The exact number of games released is not known but was likely around 20 The system most frequently turns up in Europe and Australia By this time the lack of significant development in Nintendo's product line began allowing more advanced systems such as the Neo Geo Pocket Color and the WonderSwan Color to be developed The Nomad was released in October 1995 in North America only 39 40 The release was six years into the market span of the Genesis with an existing library of more than 500 Genesis games According to former Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller the Nomad was not intended to be the Game Gear's replacement he believed that there was little planning from Sega of Japan for the new handheld 41 Sega was supporting five different consoles Saturn Genesis Game Gear Pico and the Master System as well as the Sega CD and 32 X add on s In Japan the Mega Drive had never been successful and the Saturn was more successful than Sony's PlayStation so Sega Enterprises CEO Hayao Nakayama decided to focus on the Saturn 42 By 1999 the Nomad was being sold at less than a third of its original price 43 The Game Boy Pocket was a redesigned version of the original Game Boy having the same features It was released in 1996 Notably this variation was smaller and lighter It came in seven different colors red yellow green blue pink black silver and transparent It was powered by two AAA batteries which provided approximately 10 hours of gameplay 44 The screen was changed to a true black and white display rather than the pea soup monochromatic display of the original Game Boy 45 Although like its predecessor the Game Boy Pocket had no backlight to allow play in a darkened area it did notably improve visibility and pixel response time mostly eliminating ghosting 46 The first model of the Game Boy Pocket did not have an LED to show battery levels but the feature was added due to public demand The Game Boy Pocket was not a new software platform and played the same software as the original Game Boy model 47 The Game com was a handheld game console released by Tiger Electronics in September 1997 It featured many new ideas for handheld consoles and was aimed at an older target audience sporting PDA style features and functions such as a touch screen and stylus citation needed The Game Boy Color also referred to as GBC or C GB was Nintendo's successor to the Game Boy and was released on October 21 1998 in Japan and in November of the same year in the United States It featured a color screen and was slightly bigger than the Game Boy Pocket The processor was twice as fast as a Game Boy's and had twice as much memory It also had an infrared communications port for wireless linking which did not appear in later versions of the Game Boy such as the Game Boy Advance The Game Boy Color was a response to pressure from game developers for a new system as they felt that the Game Boy even in its latest incarnation the Game Boy Pocket was insufficient The resulting product was backward compatible a first for a handheld console system and this leveraged the large library of games and the existing user base of the predecessor system This became a major feature of the Game Boy line since it allowed each new launch to begin with a significantly larger library than any of its competitors As of March 31 2005 the Game Boy and Game Boy Color combined to sell 118 69 million units worldwide 36 37 The console was capable of displaying up to 56 different colors simultaneously on screen from its palette of 32 768 and could add basic four color shading to games that had been developed for the original Game Boy It could also give the sprites and backgrounds separate colors for a total of more than four colors The Neo Geo Pocket Color or NG PC was released in 1999 in Japan and later that year in the United States and Europe It was a 16 bit color handheld game console designed by SNK the maker of the Neo Geo home console and arcade machine 48 It came after SNK's original Neo Geo Pocket monochrome handheld which debuted in 1998 in Japan In 2000 following SNK's purchase by Japanese Pachinko manufacturer A ruz e the Neo Geo Pocket Color was dropped from both the US and European markets purportedly due to commercial failure 49 The system seemed well on its way to being a success in the U S It was more successful than any Game Boy competitor since Sega's Game Gear but was hurt by several factors such as SNK's in famous lack of communication with third party developers and anticipation of the Game Boy Advance 50 The decision to ship U S games in cardboard boxes in a cost cutting move rather than hard plastic cases that Japanese and European releases were shipped in may have also hurt US sales 51 The WonderSwan was a handheld game console designed by Bandai It was released on March 4 1998 in Japan The 2000 s saw a major leap in innovation particularly in the second half with the release of the DS and PSP The WonderSwan Color was a handheld game console designed by Bandai It was released on December 9 2000 in Japan 52 Although the WonderSwan Color was slightly larger and heavier 7 mm and 2 g compared to the original WonderSwan the color version featured 512 KB 53 of RAM and a larger color LCD screen In addition the WonderSwan Color was compatible with the original WonderSwan library of games Prior to WonderSwan's release Nintendo had virtually a monopoly in the Japanese video game handheld market After the release of the WonderSwan Color Bandai took approximately 8 of the market share in Japan partly due to its low price of 6800 yen approximately US 65 53 Another reason for the WonderSwan's success in Japan was the fact that Bandai managed to get a deal with Square to port over the original Famicom Final Fantasy games with improved graphics and controls 53 However with the popularity of the Game Boy Advance and the reconciliation between Square and Nintendo the WonderSwan Color and its successor the Swan Crystal quickly lost its competitive advantage In 2001 Nintendo released the Game Boy Advance GBA or A GB which added two shoulder buttons a larger screen and more computing power than the Game Boy Color The design was revised two years later when the Game Boy Advance SP GBA SP a more compact version was released The SP featured a clamshell design folding open and closed like a laptop computer as well as a front lit color display and rechargeable battery Despite the smaller form factor the screen remained the same size as that of the original In 2005 the Game Boy Micro was released This revision sacrificed screen size and backwards compatibility with previous Game Boys for a dramatic reduction in total size and a brighter backlit screen A new SP model with a backlit screen was released in some regions around the same time Along with the GameCube the GBA also introduced the concept of connectivity using a handheld system as a console controller A handful of games used this feature most notably Animal Crossing Pac Man Vs Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles The Legend of Zelda Four Swords Adventures The Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker Metroid Prime and Sonic Adventure 2 Battle As of December 31 2007 the GBA GBA SP and the Game Boy Micro combined sold 80 72 million units worldwide 54 The original GP 32 was released in 2001 by the South Korean company Game Park a few months after the launch of the Game Boy Advance It featured a 32 bit CPU 133 MHz processor MP 3 and Divx player and e book reader Smart Media cards were used for storage and could hold up to 128 mb of anything downloaded through a USB cable from a PC The GP 32 was redesigned in 2003 A front lit screen was added and the new version was called GP 32 FLU Front Light Unit In summer 2004 another redesign the GP 32 BLU was made and added a backlit screen This version of the handheld was planned for release outside South Korea in Europe and it was released for example in Spain Virgin Play was the distributor While not a commercial success on the same level as mainstream handheld s only 30 000 units were sold it ended up being used mainly as a platform for user made applications and emulators of other systems being popular with developers and more technically adept users 55 Nokia released the N Gage in 2003 It was designed as a combination MP 3 player cellphone PDA radio and gaming device The system received much criticism alleging defects in its physical design and layout including its vertically oriented screen and requirement of removing the battery to change game cartridges The most well known of these was side talking or the act of placing the phone speaker and receiver on an edge of the device instead of one of the flat sides causing the user to appear as if they are speaking into a taco The N Gage QD was later released to address the design flaws of the original However certain features available in the original N Gage including MP 3 playback FM radio reception and USB connectivity were removed Second generation of N Gage launched on April 3 2008 56 in the form of a service for selected Nokia Smartphones In 2003 Tap wave released the Zodiac It was designed to be a PDA handheld game console hybrid It supported photos movies music Internet and documents The Zodiac used a special version Palm OS 5 5 2 T that supported the special gaming buttons and graphics chip Two versions were available Zodiac 1 and 2 differing in memory and looks The Zodiac line ended in July 2005 when Tap wave declared bankruptcy The Nintendo DS was released in November 2004 Among its new features were the incorporation of two screens a touchscreen wireless connectivity and a microphone port As with the Game Boy Advance SP the DS features a clamshell design with the two screens aligned vertically on either side of the hinge The DS's lower screen is touch sensitive designed to be pressed with a stylus a user's finger or a special thumb pad a small plastic pad attached to the console's wrist strap which can be affixed to the thumb to simulate an analog stick More traditional controls include four face buttons two shoulder buttons aD pad and Start and Select buttons The console also features online capabilities via the Nintendo Wi Fi Connection and ad hoc wireless networking for multiplayer games with up to sixteen players It is backwards compatible with all Game Boy Advance games but like the Game Boy Micro it is not compatible with games designed for the Game Boy or Game Boy Color In January 2006 Nintendo revealed an updated version of the DS the Nintendo DS Lite released on March 2 2006 in Japan with an updated smaller form factor 42 smaller and 21 lighter than the original Nintendo DS a cleaner design longer battery life and brighter higher quality displays with adjustable brightness It is also able to connect wirelessly with Nintendo's Wii console On October 2 2008

original in design owes a large debt to Nintendo's Game Boy Advance The second model the Game King 2 is believed to be inspired by Sony's PSP 58 This model also was upgraded with a backlit screen with a distracting background transparency which can be removed by opening up the console A color model the Game King 3 apparently exists but was only made for a brief time and was difficult to purchase outside of Asia As many of the games have an old school simplicity the device has developed a small cult following The Game king's speaker is quite loud and the cartridges ' sophisticated looping soundtracks sampled from other sources are seemingly at odds with its primitive graphics Time Top made at least one additional device sometimes labeled as Game King but while it seems to possess more advanced graphics is essentially an emulator that plays a handful of multi carts like the GB Station Light II Outside of Asia especially China however the Game king remains relatively unheard of due to the enduring popularity of Japanese handheld s such as those manufactured by Nintendo and Sony The PlayStation Portable officially abbreviated PSP 59 is a handheld game console manufactured and
