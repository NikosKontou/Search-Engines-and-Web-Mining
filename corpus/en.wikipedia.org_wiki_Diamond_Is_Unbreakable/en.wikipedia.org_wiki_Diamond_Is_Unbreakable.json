Mori oh as the summer of 1999 draws to a close Diamond Is Unbreakable is set in the fictional town of Mori oh located in S City M Prefecture which is modeled after a specific area in Hiro hi ko Araki's hometown of Sendai Miyagi Prefecture 7 The author said that the suspense and fear caused by the unusual and mysterious residents there were his inspiration 8 Although he originally intended for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure to be a mythical manga with superpowers and such he enjoyed drawing the feeling of everyday life in Diamond Is Unbreakable 8 Because he wanted to create a closed city the Stands featured were not pro actively attacking 8 During Diamond Is Unbreakable's serialization Araki received feedback from readers who felt that enemies in the manga had gotten weak 9 Although he usually does not respond to reader opinions he had heard similar comments from the editorial team and so made an exception by stating that the weaknesses inside the hearts of people are a thematic element of Part 4 He explained that sometimes he has a character's inner weaknesses drive them into a desperate situation while other times he turns the weakness into something dreadful and bases a Stand off of it Araki wrote that constantly having stronger and stronger enemies appear in a manga eventually leads you to trying to think of the farthest edges of the universe but in the real world true strength is found in not doing bad things An enemy who does bad things is a person with an inner weakness 9 With Part 4 of the series Araki said that he moved away from muscle men as they fell out of popularity with his readers and he wanted to focus more on fashion When designing his characters ' outfits Araki considers both everyday fashion and cartoonish bizarre clothing that would be impractical in real life He also for goes using specific color schemes for his characters and gives his readers different impressions through various color combinations 10 Araki said that while he drew several characters in Parts 1 through 3 naked to evoke Greek or Roman gods he stopped doing it so much with Part 4 to be a bit closer to home 11 Because he is the friend next door instead of being similar to a hero in a Greek myth like the protagonists of the previous parts Araki cited Jo suke Higashi kata as his favorite character in Diamond Is Unbreakable 8 He cited Shigeki yo Yang u's Harvest as his favorite Stand from Part 4 because although he finds his flaws and trash in ess adorable the character picks up stuff off of the ground which is pretty scary 8 Despite the prevalent belief that the manga artist character Rohan Kishi be is believed to be Araki's self insert the author revealed that he did not model Rohan after himself but is fascinated by him He said that unlike Rohan he values human life more than art 8 In the original vol u miz ation chapters 437 439 are collected in volume 47 listed on the Golden Wind page In 2000 it was announced that O tsui chi would be writing a novel based on Part 4 The novel proved difficult to complete in Kono Mystery ga Su goi 2004 O tsui chi claimed to have written over 2000 pages but thrown them all out 57 Intent on writing a
