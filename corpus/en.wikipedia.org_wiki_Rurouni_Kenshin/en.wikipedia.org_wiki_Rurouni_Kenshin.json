ura Kenshin a wandering swordsman who protects the people of Japan with a vow never to take another life Wat suki wrote the series based on his desire to make ash nen manga series different from

once committed Having vowed to never kill again he now wields a reverse bladed katana Upon arriving in Tokyo he meets a young woman named Kami ya Ka or u who is fighting a murderer who claims to be the Hito kiri Bat t sai and is tarnishing the name of the swordsman ship school that she teaches Kenshin decides to help her and defeats the fake Bat t sai After discovering that Kenshin is the true

Meg umi who has become involved in the opium trade However he also deals with old and new enemies including the former leader of the On iwa bans h Shin omori Ao shi After several months living in the dojo Kenshin faces S a it Hajime a rival from Baku matsu who is now a police officer This challenge turns out to be a test to face his successor S his hio Makoto who plans to conquer Japan by destroying the Meiji Government starting with Kyoto Feeling that S his hio's faction may attack his friends Kenshin meets S his hio alone to defeat him However many of his friends including a young On iwa bans h named Maki machi M isao whom he meets during his travels decide to help him in his fight After his first meeting with him Kenshin realizes that he must become stronger to defeat S his hio

death of her first fianc whom he had assassinated but instead they fell in love and he proposed to her Because she was related to the Edo guards who sought to kill Kenshin they realized her deception and captured her to use as bait In the final fight against the group's leader Kenshin accidentally killed To moe after she took a blow meant for him Seeking revenge for the death of his sister E nishi kidnaps Ka or u and Kenshin and his friends set out to rescue her A final battle between Kenshin and E nishi ensues with Kenshin emerging victorious M isao brings To moe's diary to E nishi who keeps it in a village to hide along with his missing father Four years later Kenshin has married Ka or u and has a son named Him ura Kenji Now at peace with himself Kenshin gives his reverse blade sword to Yah i ko as a ceremonial gift A prototype series title dR uro uni Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story appeared as two separate short stories published in 1992 and 1993 3 4 The first story published in December 1992 in the Weekly Sh nen Jump Winter Special issue for 1993 featured an early version of Kenshin preventing a crime lord from taking over the Kami ya dojo Wat suki described this first story which echoed the later Meg umi Arc as a pilot for Rur o uni Kenshin He stated that the final series was not entirely his own initiative finding historical stories difficult he had initially wanted to create a contemporary series After an editor requested a new historical story Wat suki developed a concept set in the Baku matsu period inspired by Moe yo Ken Burn O Sword with a narrative approach similar to San shiro Suga ta He experimented with various titles including Nish in Two Hearts Kenshin Y oro zu ya Jack of All Trades Kenshin and variations of Rur o uni and Kenshin using different kanji 3 The second Rur o uni story published in April 1993 in the Weekly Sh nen Jump 21 22 double issue featured Kenshin aiding a wealthy girl named Rai k ji Chi zur u Wat suki recalled difficulty condensing the narrative into 31 pages He stated that he put all his soul into it but later viewed it less favorably after beginning the main Rur o uni Kenshin serialization This second one shot received mediocre reviews and approximately 200 reader letters 4 Wat suki referred to it as a side story 3 The design for Hi ko S eij uro Kenshin's master was based on a character of the same name from Wat suki's one shot Crescent Moon of the Warring States with additional influence from Hike n Maj in Haj e run in Takeshi Ob at a's Arabian Lamp Lamp Wat suki noted his fascination with images of manliness and that Hi ko was an early reflection of this interest 5 Seeking to create a character opposite to the tall armored man from his debut work Wat suki designed Kenshin to appear feminine He stated he used no real motif for Kenshin and added the cross shaped scar without specific intent Like several characters Kenshin was influenced by the Shin seng umi incorporating elements from Ok it a S ji and S a it Hajime to convey an air of mystery 6 From his initial storyboard s Wat suki noted that Kenshin's appearance resembled Ku rama from Yoshihiro Togas hi's YuYu Hakusho He considered himself less experienced at the time and preferred drawing handsome men contrasting with the design of Hi ko S eij uro from a previous one shot Wat suki f el tRuro uni Kenshin competed more with the dramatic focus of YuYu Hakusho than action oriented series like Dragon Ball To distinguish his series he crafted Kenshin as an adult with a dark past rooted in the Edo period Despite competition from major 1990 s Weekly Sh nen Jump titles like Slam Dunk Dragon Ball and YuYu Hakusho the manga performed well Kenshin's adult status was a departure from typical young sh nen protagonists aside from series like City Hunter and Wat suki was mindful of character aging 7 Wat suki's childhood kendo practice influenced the series While developing one shots he based some character names on places he had lived such as Maki machi M isao and Sanj T suba me named after locations in Niigata 8 An editor suggested Wat suki examine the Samurai Sho down fighting games for character inspiration He aimed for a realistic series generally avoiding supernatural elements despite the sh nen demographic with few exceptions like Yuki shiro E nishi's double jump ability to counter Kenshin's aerial style For the ending Wat suki believed a mass murderer like Kenshin should face death citing As hit a no Joe as a precedent for a hero's demise 9 10 When serialization began Wat suki had modest expectations and planned to conclude the story in about 30 chapters with Kenshin departing Tokyo similar to volume 7 Antagonists from Kyoto would send an assassin after him The introduction of the On iwa bans h expanded the cast and the series ' popularity grew significantly following reader surveys 11 For the seventh volume Wat suki's editor proposed a longer story arc leading to the creation of the conflict with S his hio Makoto Initially planned for one year the Kyoto arc extended to a year and a half This arc developed Kenshin's character whom Wat suki felt lacked weaknesses and honed the author's artistic skills The final J in chu arc conceived pre serialization became longer than intended to avoid oversimplification To lighten the Kyoto arc's dark tone Wat suki introduced the comical Maki machi M isao 12 Fascinated by the Shin seng umi Wat suki based characters on historical members and fictional representations from Japan's Baku matsu period 13 14 He found historical characterization challenging After difficulties with Sagar a S z he designed S a it Hajime in his own style diverging from history and was pleased with the result 11 However he noted that some Japanese Shin seng umi fans objected to S a it 's sadistic portrayal 13 The final scene of Kenshin returning to the dojo was inspired by the first opening of the anime adaptation So baka su by Judy and Mary 15 For the final arc Wat suki intended to portray the five comrades as scum like but found it difficult to make enjoyable villains without ideals or beliefs 16 The story darkened when most characters believed Ka or u was killed by Yuki shiro E nishi causing Kenshin to question his path and retreat Wat suki disliked Kenshin's angst so My j in Yah i ko temporarily became the protagonist 11 Although the plot for Kenshin's past was set years before serialization Wat suki expressed regrets about his portrayal of Yuki shiro To moe 17 The final villains the S shin lacked personality models and were created to fill out the numbers as the story progressed 18 Wat suki considered a Hokkaido episode sequel but chose to end Rur o uni Kenshin with the J in chu arc to begin a new manga 19 Due to the series ' dark themes he concluded it fearing further development would not suit the sh nen demographic 20 In 2012 Wat suki revealed that his editor Hisashi Sasaki supported his decision to end the series at its peak of popularity respecting both the author's physical limits and the readers 21 Wat suki expressed satisfaction with the ending contrasting it with series that continue until canceled due to declining popularity 22 For the finale Wat suki designed new looks with potential sequels in mind He initially planned to shorten Kenshin's hair but found it too similar to Multi from To Heart Him ura Kenji the clich son of Kenshin and Ka or u was introduced as Wat suki felt his appearance was necessary 23 A design for an older Sano suke was drafted but went unused later repurposed for his father Higashi dani Kam is him oem on 24 Wat suki expressed attachment to E nishi and a desire to use him in a future work 25 Another sequel concept involved a teenage Yah i ko Wat suki redesigned him to impress readers as a potential protagonist blending Kenshin's appearance with Sano suke's personality He added Sano suke's kanji for evil aku to Yah i ko's clothing pleased that readers recognized it While not planning a sequel he suggested it would star Yah i ko Sanj T suba me and Tsuka yama Yuta r potentially featuring their son My j in Shin ' ya as a skilled swordsman 26 The series ' central theme is responsibility exemplified by Him ura Kenshin's quest for atonement for his past as an assassin during the Baku matsu by vowing to protect the innocent with a reverse bladed sword saka bat 27 Marco Olivier of Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University notes that the saka bat symbolizes Kenshin's oath never to kill again a pledge frequently tested by other warriors in the narrative 28 This theme of redemption inspires other characters such as the former drug dealer Taka ni Meg umi to reform and become a doctor after learning of Kenshin's past 27 Another significant theme is the pursuit of power primarily explored through Sagar a Sano suke and My j in Yah i ko who seek to become stronger to support Kenshin 27 The narrative also discourages revenge as illustrated in the final arc when Yuki shiro E nishi upon believing he has achieved vengeance is tormented by hallucinations of his deceased sister wearing a sorrowful expression 27 Author Nobuhiro Wat suki described My j in Yah i ko as an outlet for his kendo enthusiasm noting that Yah i ko knows a pain that hero types like Him ura Kenshin and Sagar a Sano suke can never know 29 To better relate to the series ' young demographic Wat suki strengthened Yah i ko's character gradually culminating in significant development during the Kyoto arc that surprised readers 30 When asked if self redemption was the series ' central theme Wat suki cited the influence of sh jo manga from his youth on his writing He intended to distinguish Kenshin as a protagonist who is neither purely good nor evil 11 While the story adopted a more adult tone from volume 7 onward due to its conflicts Wat suki noted it retained ash jo influence During development he considered killing off Kami ya Ka or u but ultimately chose a happy ending suitable for the young readership 11 The Oxford Handbook of American Folklore and Folklife Studies observes that Kenshin is a far cry from American superheroes due to his androgynous appearance and self deprecating nature However his quest for redemption is identified as the manga's core theme making him rel a table to Eastern audiences and the narrative is noted for balancing individualism with community 31 Wat suki described himself as an infatuated rather than passionate person leading him to subtitle the series a Meiji Swordsman Story instead of a Meiji Love Story 32 According to Bringing Forth a World Engaged Pedagogy in the Japanese University the manga reflects the societal confusion in Japan following the economic disenchantment of the early 1990 s and presents a contrast to visualization s of Japanese history found in school textbooks particularly given its young audience 33 While grounded in realism the series offers an optimistic portrayal of samurai that diverges from historical accuracy This unique approach particularly in its handling of Kenshin's character led to the manga being conceptualized as neo shonen for its departure from previous norms in Weekly Sh nen Jump 34 Written and illustrated by Nobuhiro Wat suki Rur o uni Kenshin was serialized in Shueisha's sh nen manga magazine Weekly Sh nen Jump from April 12 1994 b to

2021 poll in which 150 000 people voted for their top 100 manga series Rur o uni Kenshin ranked 31 st 128 The manga has received praise and criticism from various publications Mania Entertainment writer Megan Lavey found that the manga had a good balance between character development comedy and action scenes Wat suki's artwork was said to have improved as the series continued noting that characters also had reactions during fights 129 130 Steve Rai teri from Library Journal praised the series for its characters and battles However he noted that some fights were too violent so he recommended the series to older teenagers as well as adults 131 Surat described the series as an example of a neo sh nen series where a sh nen series also appeals to a female audience Surat stated that in such series character designs are pretty for female audiences but not too girly for male audiences Surat cited Shin omori Ao shi and Set a S j ir characters who ranked highly in popularity polls even though in Surat's view Ao shi does not engage in meaningful battles and S j ir is a kid Surat explained that Ao shi appears like a Clamp character wearing Gambit's coat and S j ir always smiles despite the abuse inflicted upon him 132 Surat said that the character designs for the anime television series were toughened up a bit He added that the budget for animation and music was top notch because Sony produced the budget 133 Wat suki's writing involving romance and Kenshin's psychological hidden weak points also earned positive responses from other sites with Anime National so comparing it to Clamp's X based on the multiple elements of the series 134 135 In general Mania found Wat suki's art appealing as well as its evolution across the twenty eight volumes as it made female characters more attractive while the male characters seemed simpler while retaining the early handsome looks 136 As a result of the series taking a darker tone in later story arcs with Kenshin facing new threats and at the same time his Bat to sai self Kat Kan from Voice of Youth Advocates recommended it to older teens Kan also found that anime viewers will also enjoy Wat suki's drawings due to the way he illustrates battles 137 This is mostly noted in the Kyoto arc where Mania Entertainment writer Megan Lavey applauded the fight between Him ura Kenshin and anti hero Saito Hajime which acts as the prologue of such a narrative 130 Mania remarks on the buildup Ao shi Saito and other characters bring to the story due to how they share similar goals in the same arc with newcomer M isao helping to balance the style by bringing more comical interactions with the protagonist 138 Although the site Manga News enjoyed Set a So jiro's fight and how it connected with S his hio's past they said the sixteenth manga's best part was Kenshin's fight against S his hio due to the buildup and symbolism the two characters have 139 The eventual climax led to further praise based on how menacing S his hio is shown in the battle against his predecessor although he questioned if Kenshin had been a superior enemy if he had kept back his original killer person a 140 Critics expressed mixed opinions in regards to the final arc Zac Bertsch y from Anime News Network ANN praised the story from the manga but noted that by volume 18 of the series Wat suki started to repeat the same type of villains who were united to kill Kenshin similar to Tri gun Although he praised Wat suki's characters he commented that some of them needed some consistency due to various bizarre antagonists 141 Due to Ka or u Kenshin and Sano suke missing from the final arc during the J in chu arc Manga News described Ao shi as the star of the series ' 24 th volume due to how he explores the mysteries behind E nishi's revenge and his subsequent actions that made him stand out most notably because he had been absent for multiple chapters 142 IGN reviewer A E Sparrow liked the manga's ending praising how
