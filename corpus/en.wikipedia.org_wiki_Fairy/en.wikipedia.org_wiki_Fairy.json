    "transformers_text": "A fairy also called fay fa e fa e folk fey fair folk or faerie is a type of mythical being or legendary creature generally described as anthropomorphic found in the folklore of multiple European cultures including Celtic Slavic Germanic and French folklore a form of spirit often with magical metaphysical supernatural or preternatural qualities Myths and stories about fairies do not have a single origin but are rather a collection of folk beliefs from disparate sources Various folk theories about the origins of fairies include casting them as either demoted angels or demons in a Christian tradition as deities in pagan belief systems as spirits of the dead as prehistoric precursors to humans or as spirits of nature The label of fairy has at times applied only to specific magical creatures with human appearance magical powers and a penchant for trickery At other times it has been used to describe any magical creature such as goblins and gnomes Fairy has at times been used as an adjective with a meaning equivalent to enchanted or magical It was also used as a name for the place these beings come from Fairyland A recurring motif of legends about fairies is the need to ward off fairies using protective charms Common examples of such charms include church bells wearing clothing inside out four leaf clover and food Fairies were also sometimes thought to haunt specific locations and to lead travelers astray using will o ' the wisps Before the advent of modern medicine fairies were often blamed for sickness particularly tuberculosis and birth deformities In addition to their folkloric origins fairies were a common feature of Renaissance literature and Romantic art and were especially popular in the United Kingdom during the Victorian and Edwardian eras The Celtic Revival also saw fairies established as a canonical part of Celtic cultural heritage The English fairy derives from the Early Modern English faerie meaning ' realm of the fay s ' Faerie in turn derives from the Old French form fai erie a derivation from fai e from Vulgar Latin fata ' the fates ' with the abstract noun suffix erie In Old French romance afa ie or fee was a woman skilled in magic and who knew the power and virtue of words of stones and of herbs 1 Fairy was used to represent an illusion or enchantment the land of the F aes collectively the inhabitants there of an individual such as a fairy knight 1 Fai e became Modern English fay while fai erie became fairy but this spelling almost exclusively refers to one individual the same meaning as fay In the sense of ' land where fairies dwell ' archaic spellings f aery and faerie are still in use Latinate fa e from which fairy derives is distinct from English fey from Old English f e which means ' fated to die ' 2 However this unrelated Germanic word fey may have been influenced by Old French fa e fay or fairy as the meaning had shifted slightly to ' fated ' from the earlier ' doomed ' or ' accursed ' 3 Various folklore traditions refer to fairies euphemistically as wee folk good folk people of peace fair folk Welsh Tyl wy th Te g etc 4 The term fairy is sometimes used to describe any magical creature including goblins and gnomes while at other times the term describes only a specific type of ethereal creature or sprite 5 Explanations for the origins of fairies range from Persian mythology 6 to the folklore of the Brythonic Bretons Welsh Cornish Gaelic Irish Scots Manx and Germanic peoples and from the pages of Middle French medieval romances According to some historians such as Barth lemy d ' Her be lot fairies were adopted from and influenced by the per is of Persian mythology 7 Per is were angelic beings that were mentioned in antiquity in pre Islamic Persia as early as the Achaemenid Empire Per is were later described in various Persian works in great detail such as the Shahnameh by Ferdowsi A peri was illustrated to be fair beautiful and extravagant nature spirits that were supported by wings This may have influenced migratory Germanic and Eurasian settlers into Europe or been transmitted during early exchanges 8 The similarities could also be attributed to a shared Proto Indo European mythology 6 In the Middle Ages fair ie was used adjectivally meaning enchanted as in fair ie knight fair ie queene but also became a generic term for various enchanted creatures during the Late Middle English period Literature of the Elizabethan era conflate d elves with the fairies of Romance culture rendering these terms somewhat interchangeable The modern concept of fairy in the narrower sense is unique to English folklore later made diminutive in accordance with prevailing tastes of the Victorian era as in fairy tales for children The Victorian era and Edwardian era saw a heightened increase of interest in fairies The Celtic Revival cast fairies as part of Ireland's cultural heritage Carole Silver and others suggested this fascination of English antiquarians arose from a reaction to greater industrialization and loss of older folk ways 9 Fairies are generally described as human in appearance and having magical powers Diminutive fairies of various kinds have been reported through centuries ranging from quite tiny to the size of a human 10 These small sizes could be magically assumed rather than constant 11 Some smaller fairies could expand their figures to imitate humans 12 On Orkney fairies were described as short in stature dressed in dark grey and sometimes seen in armour 13 In some folklore fairies have green eyes Some depictions of fairies show them with footwear others as barefoot Wings while common in Victorian and later artworks are rare in folklore fairies flew by means of magic sometimes perched on rag wort stems or the backs of birds 14 Modern illustrations often include dragonfly or butterfly wings 15 Early modern fairies does not derive from a single origin the term is a con flat ion of disparate elements from folk belief sources influenced by literature and speculation In the folklore of Ireland the mythic aes s d he or ' people of the fairy hills ' have come to a modern meaning somewhat inclusive of fairies The Scandinavian elves also served as an influence Folklorist s and mythologists have variously depicted fairies as the unworthy dead the children of Eve a kind of demon a species independent of humans an older race of humans and fallen angels 16 The folklorist ic or mythological elements combine Celtic Germanic and Greco Roman elements Folklorist s have suggested that ' fairies ' arose from various earlier beliefs which lost currency with the advent of Christianity 17 These disparate explanations are not necessarily incompatible as ' fairies ' may be traced to multiple sources A Christian tenet held that fairies were a class of demoted angels 18 One story described a group of angels revolting and God ordered the gates of heaven shut those still in heaven remained angels those in hell became demons and those caught in between became fairies 19 Others wrote that some angels not being godly enough yet not evil enough for hell were thrown out of heaven 20 This concept may explain the tradition of paying a te in d or ti the to hell as fallen angels although not quite devils they could be viewed as subjects of Satan 21 King James I in his dissertation Daemonologie stated the term f aries referred to illusory spirits demonic entities that prophesied to consorted with and transported the individuals they served in medieval times a witch or sorcerer who had a pact with a familiar spirit might receive these services 22 In England's The o sophist circles of the 19 th century a belief in the angelic nature of fairies was reported 23 Entities referred to as Devas were said to guide many processes of nature such as evolution of organisms growth of plants etc many of which resided inside the Sun Solar Angels The more Earthbound Devas included nature spirits elemental s and fairies 24 which were described as appearing in the form of colored flames roughly the size of a human 25 Arthur Conan Doyle in his 1922 book The Coming of the Fairies The The oso phi c View of Fairies reported that eminent the o sophist E L Gardner had likened fairies to butterflies whose function was to provide an essential link between the energy of the sun and the plants of Earth describing them as having no clean cut shape small hazy and somewhat luminous clouds of colour with a brighter sparkish nucleus describing them as having no clean cut shape small hazy and somewhat luminous clouds of colour with a brighter sparkish nucleus need quotation to verify That growth of a plant which we regard as the customary and inevitable result of associating the three factors of sun seed and soil would never take place if the fairy builders were absent 26 For a similar concept in Persian mythology see Peri At one time it was thought that fairies were initially worshiped as deities such as nymphs and tree spirits 27 and with the burgeoning predominance of the Christian Church reverence for these deities carried on but in a dwindling state of perceived power Many deprecated deities of older folklore and myth were repurposed as fairies in Victorian fiction See the works of W B Yeats for examples A recorded Christian belief of the 17 th century cast all fairies as demons 28 This perspective grew more popular with the rise of Puritanism among the Reformed Church of England See Anglicanism 29 The hobgoblin once a friendly household spirit became classed as a wicked goblin 30 Dealing with fairies was considered a form of witchcraft and punished as such 31 In William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream Oberon king of the faeries states that neither he nor his court fears the church bells which the author and Christian apologist C S Lewis cast as a politic d is association from faeries 32 although Lewis makes it clear that he himself does not consider fairies to be demons in his chapter on the topic The Long aevi or long livers from The Discarded Image In an era of intellectual and religious upheaval some Victorian reappraisals of mythology cast deities in general as metaphors for natural events 33 which was later refuted by other authors See The Triumph of the Moon by Ronald Hutton This contentious thought environment contributed to the modern meaning of ' fairies ' One belief held that fairies were spirits of the dead 34 This derived from many factors common in various folklore and myths same or similar tales of both ghosts and fairies the Irish s d he origin of their term for fairies were ancient burial mounds deemed dangerous to eat food in Fairyland and Hades the dead and fairies depicted as living underground 35 Diane Pur kiss observed an equating of fairies with the untimely dead who left unfinished lives 36 One tale recounted a man caught by the fairies who found that whenever he looked steadily at a fairy it appeared as a dead neighbor of his 37 This theory was among the more common traditions related although many informants also expressed doubts 38 There is an outdated theory that fairy folklore evolved from folk memories of a prehistoric race newcomers superseded a body of earlier human or humanoid peoples and the memories of this defeated race developed into modern conceptions of fairies Proponents find support in the tradition of cold iron as a charm against fairies viewed as a cultural memory of invaders with iron weapons displacing peoples who had just stone bone wood etc at their disposal and were easily defeated 19 th century archaeologists uncovered underground rooms in the Orkney islands that resembled the Elf land described in Childe Rowland 39 which lent additional support In folklore flint arrowheads from the Stone Age were attributed to the fairies as elf shot 40 while their green clothing and underground homes spoke to a need for camouflage and covert shelter from hostile humans their magic a necessary skill for combating those with superior weaponry In a Victorian tenet of evolution mythic cannibalism among ogres was attributed to memories of more savage races practicing alongside superior races of more refined sensibilities 41 The most important modern proponent of the ' hidden people ' theory was the Scottish folklorist and antiquarian David Mac Ritchie 42 A theory that fairies were an intelligent species distinct from humans and angels 43 An alchemist Paracelsus classed gnomes and sylphs as elemental s meaning magical entities who personify a particular force of nature and exert powers over these forces 44 Folklore accounts have described fairies as spirits of the air 45 Much folklore of fairies involves methods of protecting oneself from their malice by means such as cold iron charms see amulet talisman of rowan trees or various herbs or simply shunning locations known to be their s ergo avoiding offending any fairies 46 Less harmful pranks ascribed to fairies include tangling the hair of sleepers into fairy locks aka elf locks stealing small items and leading a traveler astray More dangerous behaviors were also attributed to fairies any form of sudden death might have stemmed from a fairy kidnapping the evident corpse a magical replica of wood 47 Consumption tuberculosis was sometimes blamed on fairies who forced young men and women to dance at revels every night causing them to waste away from lack of rest 48 Rowan trees were considered sacred to fairies 49 and a charm tree to protect one's home 50 Various folklorist s have proposed classification systems for fairies Using terms popularized by W B Yeats trooping fairies are those who appear in groups and might form settlements as opposed to solitary fairies who do not live or associate with others of their kind In this context the term fairy is usually held in a wider sense including various similar beings such as dwarves and elves of Germanic folklore 31 In Scottish folklore fairies are divided into theSe elie Court more beneficently inclined but still dangerous and the Un see lie Court more malicious While fairies of the See lie Court enjoyed playing generally harmless pranks on humans those of the Un see lie Court often brought harm to humans for entertainment 40 Both could be dangerous to humans if offended Some scholars have cautioned against the overuse of dividing fairies into types 51 British folklore historian Simon Young noted that classification varies widely from researcher to researcher and pointed out that it does not necessarily reflect old beliefs since those people living hundreds of years ago did not structure their experience as we do 52 A considerable amount of lore about fairies revolves around changelings fairies left in the place of stolen humans 9 In particular folklore describes how to prevent the fairies from stealing babies and substituting changelings and abducting older people as well 53 The theme of the swapped child is common in medieval literature and reflects concern over infants thought to be afflicted with unexplained diseases disorders or developmental disabilities In pre industrial Europe a peasant family's subsistence frequently depended upon the productive labor of each member and a person who was a permanent drain on the family's scarce resources could pose a threat to the survival of the entire family 54 In terms of protective charms wearing clothing inside out 55 church bells St John's wort and four leaf clovers are regarded as effective In Newfoundland folklore the most popular type of fairy protection is bread varying from stale bread to hard tack or a slice of fresh homemade bread Bread is associated with the home and the hearth as well as with industry and the taming of nature and as such seems to be disliked by some types of fairies On the other hand in much of the Celtic folklore baked goods are a traditional offering to the folk as are cream and butter 23 The prototype of food and therefore a symbol of life bread was one of the commonest protections against fairies Before going out into a fairy haunted place it was customary to put a piece of dry bread in one's pocket 56 In County Wexford Ireland in 1882 it was reported that if an infant is carried out after dark a piece of bread is wrapped in its bib or dress and this protects it from any witchcraft or evil 57 Bells also have an ambiguous role while they protect against fairies the fairies riding on horseback such as the fairy queen often have bells on their harness This may be a distinguishing trait between theSe elie Court from the Un see lie Court such that fairies use them to protect themselves from more wicked members of their race 58 Another ambiguous piece of folklore revolves about poultry a cock's crow drove away fairies but other tales recount fairies keeping poultry 59 While many fairies will confuse travelers on the path the will o ' the wisp can be avoided by not following it Certain locations known to be haunts of fairies are to be avoided C S Lewis reported hearing of a cottage more feared for its reported fairies than its reported ghost 60 In particular digging in fairy hills was unwise Paths that the fairies travel are also wise to avoid Home owners have knocked corners from houses because the corner blocked the fairy path 61 and cottages have been built with the front and back doors in line so that the owners could in need leave them both open and let the fairies troop through all night 62 Locations such as fairy forts were left undisturbed even cutting brush on fairy forts was reputed to be the death of those who performed the act 63 Fairy trees such as thorn trees were dangerous to chop down one such tree was left alone in Scotland though it prevented a road from being widened for seventy years 64 Other actions were believed to offend fairies Brownies were known to be driven off by being given clothing though some folktales recounted that they were offended by the inferior quality of the garments given and others merely stated it some even recounting that the brownie was delighted with the gift and left with it 65 Other brownies left households or farms because they heard a complaint or a compliment 66 People who saw the fairies were advised not to look closely because they resented infringements on their privacy 67 The need to not offend them could lead to problems one farmer found that fairies threshed his corn but the threshing continued after all his corn was gone and he concluded that they were stealing from his neighbors leaving him the choice between offending them dangerous in itself and profiting by the theft 68 Millers were thought by the Scots to be no canny owing to their ability to control the forces of nature such as fire in the kiln water in the burn and for being able to set machinery a whirring Superstitious communities sometimes believed that the miller must be in league with the fairies In Scotland fairies were often mischievous and to be feared No one dared to set foot in the mill or kiln at night as it was known that the fairies brought their corn to be milled after dark So long as the locals believed this the miller could sleep secure in the knowledge that his stores were not being robbed John Fraser the miller of White hill claimed to have hidden and watched the fairies trying unsuccessfully to work the mill He said he decided to come out of hiding and help them upon which one of the fairy women gave him ago w pen double handful of meal and told him to put it in his empty gir nal store saying that the store would remain full for a long time no matter how much he took out 69 It is also believed that to know the name of a particular fairy a person could summon it and force it to do their bidding The name could be used as an insult towards the fairy in question but it could also rather contradict ori ly be used to grant powers and gifts to the user citation needed Before the advent of modern medicine many physiological conditions were untreatable and when children were born with abnormalities it was common to blame the fairies 70 Sometimes fairies are described as assuming the guise of an animal 71 In Scotland it was peculiar to the fairy women to assume the shape of deer while witches became mice hares cats gulls or black sheep In The Legend of Knocks hig own a in order to frighten a farmer who pastured his herd on fairy ground a fairy queen took on the appearance of a great horse with the wings of an eagle and a tail like a dragon hissing loud and spitting fire Then she would change into a little man lame of a leg with a bull's head and a lambent flame playing round it 72 In the 19 th century Child ballad Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight the elf knight is a Bluebeard figure and Isabel must trick and kill him to preserve her life 73 The child ballad Tam Lin reveals that the title character though living among the fairies and having fairy powers was in fact an earthly knight and though his life was pleasant now he feared that the fairies would pay him as their te in d ti the to hell 73 Sir Orfeo tells how Sir Orfeo's wife was kidnapped by the King of Faerie and only by trickery and an excellent harping ability was he able to win her back Sir Deg are narrates the tale of a woman overcome by her fairy lover who in later versions of the story is unmasked as a mortal Thomas the Rhyme r shows Thomas escaping with less difficulty but he spends seven years in Elf land 74 Ois n is harmed not by his stay in Faerie but by his return when he dismounts the three centuries that have passed catch up with him reducing him to an aged man 75 King Her la O E Her la cy ning originally a guise of Woden but later Christianised as a king in a tale by Walter Map was said by Map to have visited a dwarf's underground mansion and returned three centuries later although only some of his men crumbled to dust on dismounting Her la and his men who did not dismount were trapped on horseback this being one account of the origin of the Wild Hunt of European folklore 76 77 A common feature of the fairies is the use of magic to disguise their appearance Fairy gold is notoriously unreliable appearing as gold when paid but soon thereafter revealing itself to be leaves gorse blossoms gingerbread cakes or a variety of other comparatively worthless things 78 These illusions are also implicit in the tales of fairy ointment Many tales from Northern Europe 79 80 tell of a mortal woman summoned to attend a fairy birth sometimes attending a mortal kidnapped woman's child bed Invariably the woman is given something for the child's eyes usually an ointment through mischance or sometimes curiosity she uses it on one or both of her own eyes At that point she sees where she is one midwife realizes that she was not attending a great lady in a fine house but her own runaway maid servant in a wretched cave She escapes without making her ability known but sooner or later betrays that she can see the fairies She is invariably blinded in that eye or in both if she used the ointment on both 81 There have been claims by people in the past like William Blake to have seen fairy funerals 82 Allan Cunningham in his Lives of Eminent British Painters records that William Blake claimed to have seen a fairy funeral ' Did you ever see a fairy's funeral madam ' said Blake to a lady who happened to s it next to him ' Never sir ' said the lady ' I have ' said Blake ' but not before last night ' And he went on to tell how in his garden he had seen ' a procession of creatures of the size and colour of green and grey grasshoppers bearing a body laid out on a rose leaf which they buried with songs and then disappeared ' They are believed to be an omen of death The Tuatha D Danann are a race of supernaturally gifted people in Irish mythology They are thought to represent the main deities of pre Christian Ireland Many of the Irish modern tales of the Tuatha D Danann refer to these beings as fairies though in more ancient times they were regarded as goddesses and gods The Tuatha D Danann were spoken of as having come from islands in the north of the world or in other sources from the sky After being victorious in a series of battles with other otherworldly beings and then being defeated by the ancestors of the current Irish people they were said to have withdrawn to the s d he fairy mounds where they lived on in popular imagination as fairies citation needed They are associated with several Other world realms including Mag Mell ' the Pleasant Plain ' E main Ab lach ' the place of apples ' and Tir na n g ' the Land of Youth ' The a os s is the Irish term for a supernatural race in Irish comparable to the fairies or elves They are variously said to be ancestors the spirits of nature or goddesses and gods 83 A common theme found among the Celtic nations describes a race of people who had been driven out by invading humans In old Celtic fairy lore the A os S ' people of the fairy mounds ' are immortals living in the ancient barrows and cairns The Irish banshee Irish Gaelic bean s previously bean s d he ' woman of the fairy mound ' is sometimes described as a ghost 84 In the 1691 The Secret Commonwealth of Elves Fauns and Fairies Reverend Robert Kirk minister of the Parish of Aberfoyle Stirling Scotland wrote These Sith s or Fairies they callS lea gh Mai thor the Good People are said to be of middle nature between Man and Angel as were Daemons thought to be of old of intelligent fluid o us Spirits and light changeable bodies ly ke those called Astral somewhat of the nature of a condensed cloud and best seen in twilight These bodies be so pliable through the sublet y of Spirits that agitate them that they can make them appear or disappear at pleasure 85 The word fairy was used to describe an individual inhabitant of Faerie before the time of Chaucer 1 Fairies appeared in medieval romances as one of the beings that a knight errant might encounter A fairy lady appeared to Sir La un fal and demanded his love like the fairy bride of ordinary folklore she imposed a prohibition on him that in time he violated Sir Orfeo's wife was carried off by the King of Faerie Huon of Bordeaux is aided by King Oberon 86 These fairy characters dwindled in number as the medieval era progressed the figures became wizards and enchantresses 87 The oldest fairies on record in England were first described by the historian Ger vase of Tilbury in the 13 th century 88 In the 1485 book Le Morte d ' Arthur Morgan le Fay whose connection to the realm of Faerie is implied in her name is a woman whose magic powers stem from study 89 While somewhat diminished with time fairies never completely vanished from the tradition Edmund Spenser featured fairies in his 1590 book The Faerie Queene 90 In many works of fiction fairies are freely mixed with the nymphs and satyrs of classical tradition 91 while in others e g Lamia they were seen as displacing the Classical beings 15 th century poet and monk John Ly d gate wrote that King Arthur was crowned in the land of the fairy and taken in his death by four fairy queens to Avalon where he lies under a fairy hill until he is needed again 92 Fairies appear as significant characters in William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream which is set simultaneously in the woodland and in the realm of Fairyland under the light of the Moon 93 and in which a disturbance of nature caused by a fairy dispute creates tension underlying the plot and informing the actions of the characters According to Maurice Hunt Chair of the English Department at Baylor University the blurring of the identities of fantasy and reality makes possible that pleasing narcotic dreamin ess associated with the fairies of the play 94 Shakespeare's contemporary Michael Drayton features fairies in his Nim phi dia and from these stem Alexander Pope's sylphs of the 1712 poem The Rape of the Lock In the mid 17 th century the French literary style pr cie uses took up the oral tradition of such tales to write fairy tales and Madame d ' Aul no y invented the term contes de f e ' fairy tale ' 95 While the tales told by the pr cie uses included many fairies they were less common in other countries ' tales indeed the Brothers Grimm included fairies in their first edition but decided this was not authentically German and altered the language in later editions changing each Fee fairy to an enchantress or wise woman 96 J R R Tolkien described these tales as taking place in the land of Faerie 97 Additionally not all folktales that feature fairies are generally categorized as fairy tales The modern depiction of fairies was shaped in the literature of Romanticism during the Victorian era Writers such as Walter Scott and James Hog g were inspired by folklore which featured fairies such as the Border ballads This era saw an increase in the popularity of collecting fairy folklore and an increase in the creation of original works with fairy characters 98 In Rudyard Kipling's 1906 book of short stories and poems Puck of Poo k's Hill Puck holds to scorn the moralizing fairies of other Victorian works 99 The period also saw a revival of older themes in fantasy literature such as C S Lewis's Narnia books which while featuring many such classical beings as fauns and dryads mingles them freely with hags giants and other creatures of the folkloric fairy tradition 100 Victorian flower fairies were popularized in part by Queen Mary's keen interest in fairy art and by British illustrator and poet Cicely Mary Barker's series of eight books published in 1923 through 1948 Imagery of fairies in literature became prettier and smaller as time progressed 101 Andrew Lang complaining of the fairies of poly an th uses and gardenias and apple blossoms in the introduction to The Lilac Fairy Book 1910 observed that These fairies try to be funny and fail or they try to preach and succeed 102 A story of the origin of fairies appears in a chapter about Peter Pan in J M Barrie's 1902 novel The Little White Bird and was incorporated into his later works about the character Barrie wrote When the first baby laughed for the first time his laugh broke into a million pieces and they all went skipping about That was the beginning of fairies 103 Fairies are seen in Neverland in Peter and Wendy the 1911 novel version of J M Barrie's famous Peter Pan stories and its character Tinker Bell has become a pop culture icon When Peter Pan is guarding Wendy from pirates the story says After a time he fell asleep and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on their way home from an orgy Any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night they would have mischief ed but they just tweaked Peter's nose and passed on 104 Images of fairies have appeared as illustrations often in books of fairy tales as well as in photographic media and sculpture Some artists known for their depictions of fairies include Cicely Mary Barker Amy Brown David Del am are Meredith Dill man Gustave Dor Brian Frou d Warwick Gob le Jasmine Becket Griffith Rebecca Gua y Florence Harrison Alan Lee Ida Ren toul Ou thwaite My re a Pet t it Arthur Rackham S uz a Sca lora and Nene Thomas 105 The Fairy Doors of Ann Arbor MI are small doors installed into local buildings Local children believe these are the front doors of fairy houses and in some cases small furniture dishes and various other things can be seen beyond the doors The Victorian era was particularly noted for fairy paintings The Victorian painter Richard D add created paintings of fairy folk with a sinister and malign tone Other Victorian artists who depicted fairies include John A nster Fitzgerald John Atkinson Grim shaw Daniel Mac lise and Joseph Noel Pat on 106 Interest in fairy themed art enjoyed a brief renaissance following the publication of the Cot tingle y Fairies photographs in 1920 and a number of artists turned to painting fairy themes citation needed Most Christians have been negative or skeptical regarding creatures such as fairies or nature spirits but a minority of Christian thinkers have advocated for the reality of fairies in positive terms One early example is Origen of Alexandria in Contra Cel sum 8 31 from about the year 248 We indeed also maintain with regard not only to the fruits of the earth but to every flowing stream and every breath of air that the ground brings forth those things which are said to grow up naturally that the water springs in fountains and refreshes the earth with running streams that the air is kept pure and supports the life of those who breathe it only in consequence of the agency and control of certain beings whom we may call invisible husbandmen and guardians but we deny that those invisible agents are demons About a century later c 335 Athanasius of Alexandria gives an exclusively negative assessment of these same creatures On the Incarnation 8 47 as simply demons taking up their abode in springs or rivers or trees or stones and imposing upon simple people by their frauds While such negative or skeptical ideas remained the majority positions for Christians some exceptions can be found such as the Scottish minister Robert Kirk who wrote The Secret Commonwealth of Elves Fauns and Fairies in the later seventeenth century 1893 In the modern era C S Lewis writes about the possibility of fairies being real in The Long aevi the Long livers or Long Lived Ones in his book The Discarded Image Lewis also shared this account of comments by J R R Tolkien within a letter to Arthur G reeves 22 June 1930 Tolkien once remarked to me that the feeling about home must have been quite different in the days when a family had fed on the produce of the same few miles of country for six generations and that perhaps this was why they saw nymphs in the fountains and dryads in the woods they were not mistaken for there was in a sense a real not metaphorical connection between them and the countryside What had been earth and air and later corn and later still bread really was in them We of course who live on a standardised international diet you may have had Canadian flour English meat Scotch oatmeal African oranges Australian wine to day are really artificial beings and have no connection save in sentiment with any place on earth We are synthetic men uprooted The strength of the hills is not ours Tolkien shares more about the possible reality of fairies in a manuscript published posthumously If Fairies really exist independently of Men then very few of our ' Fairy stories ' have any relation to them They are a quite separate creation living in another mode They appear to us in human form with hands faces voices and language similar to our own this may be their real form and their difference reside in something other than form or it may be probably is only the way in which their presence affects us Rabbits and eagles may be aware of them quite otherwise For lack of a better word they may be called spirits daemons inherent powers of the created world deriving more directly and ' earlier ' in terrestrial history from the creating will of God but nonetheless created 107 Christian theologians John Mil bank and David Bentley Hart have spoken and written about the real existence of fairies 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 as has the Christian philosopher Stephen R L Clark 115 116 Hart was a 2015 Templeton Fellow at the University of Notre Dame Institute for Advanced Study and has published the most on this topic including references in multiple interviews and books especially Roland in Moonlight For example Hart has written Of course mermaids exist Or to be more precise of course water spirits and magical marine beings of every kind are real and numerous and in certain circumstances somewhat dangerous The modern reports of real encounters with mermaids or other water spirits such as two from Zimbabwe one from South Africa three from northeastern India and so on are so ingenuous well attested and credible that only a brute would refuse to believe them and there is a real moral imperative in not dismissing such tales as lies or delusions 117 D iwata in Philippine mythology are nature spirits or minor deities often seen as fairies in modern times The term comes from the Sanskrit dev at a deity and they are sometimes linked with fairies called lamb an a In modern Tagalog d iwata means fairy or nymph 118 119 120 121 122 123 The word is thought to originate from the Sanskrit word dev at a 124 125 It refers particularly to nature spirits of extraordinary beauty like Maria Maki ling 126 Fairy
