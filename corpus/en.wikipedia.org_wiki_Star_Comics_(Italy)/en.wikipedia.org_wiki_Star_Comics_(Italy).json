    "transformers_text": "Star Comics is an Italian comic book publisher founded in December 1987 that publishes Italian editions of manga and Italian comics in Italy Until the establishment of Marvel Italia now an imprint of Panini Comics in 1994 it also published Italian editions of many Marvel Comics's comic books Star Comics has twenty eight publishing branches and as of 2007 has published a total of 316 manga series in Italy In the mid 1980 s the popularity of Marvel Comics superheroes in Italy was in sharp decline After nearly fifteen years of publication by Editorial e Corno and following a tremendous success in the previous decade only one series featuring original stories remained L ' Uomo Rag no second series which came to an end with issue no 58 in January 1984 coinciding with the bankruptcy of Editorial e Corno This was followed by a complete publishing void that lasted about fifteen months In the autumn of 1985 a small publisher from To di Labor Comics acquired the rights to publish two Marvel comic series Alien featuring material from the Epic imprint and Coll an a Labor which included stories from the Marvel Graphic Novel series vol 1 It was in the latter magazine that Marco Marcello Lupo i made his editorial debut in December 1985 In 1986 Labor launched another magazine titled Marvel to showcase the regular superhero series by Stan Lee It began with the now classic Proteus Saga created by the duo Chris Claremont and John Byrne and taken from issues 123 126 of the American Uncanny X Men series However the monthly publication shut down after just two issues along with the publishing house itself From the ashes of Labor Comics Star Comics was born in 1987 through the efforts of Sergio Cava llerin and Marco Marcello Lupo i The duo proposed to Giovanni B ov in i owner of a printing press in Bosco a district of Perugia the low cost publication of L Uomo Rag no The proposal was accepted and the project launched on 6 March 1987 with Cava llerin as editor in chief and Lupo i as editorial coordinator Sales were initially slow but eventually rose enough for Star Comics to turn a profit and launch other popular titles such as Fantastic Four Gli inc red ibi li X Men Captain America e i Vend ica tori The Avengers Il Pun it ore along with lesser known series and special one shots The arrival of Marvel Italia in 1994 which acquired all rights to Marvel's publications in Italy prompted Star Comics to completely rethink its superhero line The publisher had to relinquish the series previously managed by Lupo i who immediately joined Marvel Italia but managed to stay afloat thanks to a new editorial team recruited by A de Capone and led by Paolo A Liv or at i with translations by Andrea Cotta Ramus in o and Valerio La nari In this new phase 1994 1998 Star introduced Italian audiences to comics from Image Comics including Spawn and Gen and several series from Dark Horse Comics becoming Italy s main outlet for both major American independent labels From mid 1995 due to the growing creative fragmentation of the Image consortium Star focused on the Wild Storm imprint featuring characters created by Jim Lee At the same time Star decided under the guidance of the Kappa Boys to expand beyond American titles and begin publishing manga Japanese comics This proved to be a fortunate move coinciding with and partly sparking a boom in Japanese comics readership in Italy Notably with Dragon Ball Star became the first publisher in Italy to release a manga in the original right to left reading format The company also resumed popular series left incomplete due to the bankruptcy of Granat a Press such as Ranma and Maison Ikkoku Since 1999 the Japanese sector has been the driving force of the Perugia based publisher with major titles such as Saint Seiya One Piece Shaman King Detective Conan Ken il gu err iero Le bizzar re av venture di JoJo and the aforementioned Dragon Ball and Ranma Star Comics has also published original Italian comics Among these is Lazarus Led d created by A de Capone who wrote nearly all of the approximately 200 stories of varying lengths starring the character The regular series began as a monthly in 1993 and shifted to bimonthly in 2004 concluding in November 2006 with issue no 151 titled L ' ultima battaglia The Final Battle However two or three special volumes per year are still planned In August 2004 Star Comics also acquired and relaunched Jonathan Steele created and written by Federico Memo la which had been discontinued in July of that same year by Sergio Bone lli Editor e The USA comics sector was closed in December 1998 due to several concurrent factors including the sale of Wild Storm characters to DC Comics by Jim Lee a reduction in Wild Storm's output and internal disagreements regarding editorial direction In 2004 Star Comics returned to American comics with the launch of the anthologies Star Magazine New and Star Book under the supervision of Dario Gull i However the decision to distribute the magazines only through specialty comic shops failed to yield the expected results and both publications were discontinued within two years due to low sales Likewise the magazine Star Fantasy overseen by A de Capone ended after just a few issues After a failed attempt to expand into the television magazine sector the Perugia based publisher decided to focus entirely on manga and Italian comics launching the self produced miniseries Nem rod and Khor in 2007 In 2009 Star Comics published Rourke by Federico Memo la continuing its investment in original Italian titles Thanks to the success of these Italian comic series Star Comics has increased its investment in local projects since 2010 Notable titles released after that year include Factor V V alter Bu io Pinker ton S A The Secret Dr Morgue K ep her and San Michele I Sigil li della Fol gore On the manga front 2009 was a pivotal year in the early part of the year Star Comics ended its long standing collaboration with the Kappa Boys who had served as consultants and talent scouts Although the publisher attributed the split to a divergence of objectives 1 the Kappa Boys never made a direct statement though they implied without going into detail that there may have been some contractual breaches 2 2013 marked the debut of Suo re Ninja a humorous comic scripted by Davide La Rosa and illustrated by Vanessa Cardinale produced following the success of their previous self published work Zombie Gay in Vatican o From January 2014 supervision of the Western comics division was
