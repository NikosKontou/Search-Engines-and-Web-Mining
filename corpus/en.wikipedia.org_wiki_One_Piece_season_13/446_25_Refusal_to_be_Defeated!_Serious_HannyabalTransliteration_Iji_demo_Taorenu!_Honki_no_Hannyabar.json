Meanwhile, Blackbeard uses his powers to make Magellan's poison barrier disappear, freeing Buggy and his men, while Magellan arrives on Level 4. Hannyabal, despite being badly beaten, is determined to stop Luffy for the future of the world, but Blackbeard launches a surprise attack that knocks out him and his guards. Blackbeard tells Luffy that he had planned to capture him to secure a place among the Seven Warlords of the Sea, but after capturing Ace, partly as a result of him refusing to back down after hearing about his plans for Luffy, he no longer needed to do so. Luffy, enraged, strikes Blackbeard with Jet Pistol.",
