Mr. 2 impersonates Magellan and manages to order that the gates be opened long enough to allow the prisoners' ship to escape, then immediately closed. Luffy is upset to hear of Mr. 2's staying behind, but comes to accept that there is no other choice, and thanks him over a miniature Transponder Snail. Mr. 2 stays behind to fight Magellan after he realizes what has happened as the other prisoners mourn his loss after passing through the Gates of Justice.",
