Jimbei convinces Luffy that he cannot afford to waste time fighting Blackbeard when he needs to hurry and save Ace. Crocodile questions why Blackbeard would attack the prison when doing so would mean giving up his Warlord title, but Blackbeard reveals that it is part of a larger plan. As Magellan approaches the prisoners, Luffy easily defeats the revived Minotaurus, while Ivankov defeats Sadie and ties her up with her whip. Buggy and Mr. 3 reach Level 1 with the prisoners following them. Magellan poisons Blackbeard and his crew before proceeding on to stop Luffy from escaping.",
