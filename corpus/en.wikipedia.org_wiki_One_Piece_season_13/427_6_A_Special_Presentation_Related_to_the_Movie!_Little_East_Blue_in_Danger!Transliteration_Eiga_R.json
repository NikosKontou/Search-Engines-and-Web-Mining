The Amigo Pirates decide to head ashore, but because Largo is taking a nap, Colt leads them. Nami meets with the \"Orenami\" fan club, who leads her through a maze and shows her a naked statue of her, which offends her. She sees Yoko, and finds that Yoko reminds her of herself when she first met Luffy. While the Straw Hats are at a party, the Amigo pirates attack, destroying much of the village, and demand the beetle. Luffy easily defeats Colt and his men with Zoro and Sanji's help, but Largo traps him in a needled net.",
