Meanwhile, the navy arrives at Impel Down to help capture Luffy. The captain of the guards, Sadie, order them to guard the outside of the prison, as the Impel Down guards are perfectly capable of catching Luffy themselves. Boa Hancock has finally made it to Ace's cell, and manages to inform him Luffy is coming to his rescue while Magellan and the others are occupied with other prisoners acting up.
