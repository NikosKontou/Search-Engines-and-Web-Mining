    "transformers_text": "Zombie powder stylized in all caps is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tite Kubo The manga ran in Shueisha's sh nen manga magazine Weekly Sh nen Jump for 27 chapters from August 1999 to February 2000 before being canceled The series was collected into four tank bon volumes released the following year Zombie powder is distributed in North America by Viz Media who licensed it in 2005 Although critical reception in the United States was largely mediocre the series achieved moderate commercial success in the western market due to the prominence Kubo had achieved by that point for his second manga series Bleach Zombie powder follows a teenaged boy named Elwood Shepherd who joins with mysterious criminals Gamma Akut abi and C T Smith in their search for the Rings of the Dead These rings are a group of legendary artifacts with the power to resurrect the dead and grant immortality to anyone who collects 12 of them The series has a Weird West setting which mixes a background of sparsely populated frontier settlements and gunslinger aesthetics with modern conveniences occult magic supernatural martial arts and mad science The trio travel from town to town in this world fighting other criminals for possession of the Rings of the Dead The protagonists obtain three of the rings in the course of the story but due to the series ' cancellation the eventual success or failure of their quest is unknown The series was a commercial failure in Japan but has been successful in the United States Critical consensus is that Zombie powder was a technically proficient manga but one which lacked the originality necessary to bear intrinsic appeal to most readers which accounted for its cancellation Additionally the series was heavily focused on battles even by the standards of action manga though whether this was a positive or negative trait is a matter of contention Due to these factors combined with its abrupt and unsatisfactory ending critics hold that Zombie powder is significant primarily as a chapter in the career of its author and would otherwise be a footnote which found an audience only among fans of violent action Zombie powder is set within a western themed environment with inconsistent levels of technology similar to that found in Yasuhiro Night ow's manga series Tri gun 2 3 The most prominent characters in the series are Powder Hunters individuals who seek the titular Zombie Powder a life giving substance that can imbue an individual with limitless life force capable of granting immortality and even raising people back from the dead Zombie Powder can only be obtained from the Rings of the Dead dangerous magical artifacts that individually devour the vitality of anyone they touch rendering them comatose this stolen life energy is converted into the Zombie Powder which can only be extracted if twelve Rings of the Dead are brought together The story begins with young pickpocket John Elwood Shepherd befriending Powder Hunter Gamma Akut abi after a botched attempt to rob him It also turns out Gamma is a highly wanted fugitive in possession of a Ring of the Dead because of this when another member of the local gang Elwood is working sees them together he assumes that Elwood's harboring him in hopes of turning him over for his bounty The gang attacks Elwood's home and Gamma comes to the rescue but not before Elwood's sister Sheryl is killed by the gang's leader Following the gang's assault Elwood decides to accompany Gamma in his powder hunting in hopes of resurrecting Sheryl After leaving Elwood's hometown the pair meet up with Gamma's long time partner C T Smith another Powder Hunter who's also wanted Smith has infiltrated the ranks of Ash Daughter a gang which has found a Ring of the Dead The three challenge the gang's leader Ran e water Calder and Gamma slays him using his mastery of the fictional sword art karin zan jutsu which involves the user channeling their own blood lust and manifesting it a spyro kin es is Elwood Gamma and Smith there by gain a second Ring of the Dead concluding the first arc and volume of the series The remaining three volumes concern themselves with the battle for a third ring which has been embedded for years in the body of a comatose young man named Emilio Lu f as Get to Gamma and company learn of Emilio's existence from his sister Wolf in a a tabloid photojournalist and vigilante who does not believe in the Rings of the Dead The group of hunters offer to restore Emilio to consciousness in exchange for the ring he contains Before they can do so however Emilio is kidnapped by Bal munk the Mystic a powder hunting magician who leads a circus themed gang Wolf in a teams up with Elwood Gamma and Smith to retrieve Emilio and they succeed in doing so after a number of battles with Bal munk's henchmen The conflict culminates in a fight between Gamma and a giant go lem summoned by Bal munk which Gamma defeats with the help of a berserk state Bal munk is beaten but not killed and departs whilst swearing revenge upon Gamma After rescuing Emilio Gamma arranges to have the Ring of the Dead removed from his body by an old friend mad scientist Naz na Gemini The characters are brought to Gemini's lab by Angel le Cooney a young girl with the power of teleportation Once there Gemini agrees to operate to remove the ring from Emilio in exchange for a year of experimentation rights on Wolf in a Due to the series ' early cancellation Zombie powder is ended without a solid conclusion the final chapter showing Gamma and Smith leaving Elwood and Wolf in a behind as they depart the Gemini Laboratory whose staff have just begun the operation to save Emilio It is left ambiguous whether Elwood chooses to follow Gamma and Smith stay with Wolf in a and Emilio or become a Powder Hunter in his own right According to Tite Kubo Zombie powder originated as an idea for a samurai manga which would have been titled Samurai Drive This initial conception of the story had very little in common with the end product as it did not feature western elements or the titular zombie powder It did star a version of Gamma however who still bore an over sized sword and bounty and featured scifi technologies 7 With respect to the premise of Zombie powder the author stated that the theme was fighting and a world where the hope for resurrection lay not in god but obtaining a mysterious substance 41 Tite Kubo did not comment on his influences for the series but critic Theron Martin believed its tone setting and style drew heavily on the cyberpunk manga Battle Angel A lita the dark fantasy manga Berserk and fellow sci fi western manga Tri gun 2 and A E Sparrow of IGN noted the obligatory genre influence of martial arts anime Dragon Ball Z 14 The series also borrows terminology from the music industry referring to each chapter as a track the bonus o make content in each volume as B Sides and naming primary character Elwood after a record label founder 4 Zombie powder began serialization in Shueisha's Weekly Sh nen Jump on August 2 1999 and ran a brief 27 chapters before being canceled on February 28 2000 42 According to the author's commentary in the cover leaf of the third volume Tite Kubo was in a state of severe emotional trauma when he wrote it and only began to be happy with the quality of the series as it neared its ending 43 Speaking retrospectively 12 years later Kubo stated that he was not yet used to the scheduling pressures of weekly serialization when he wrote Zombie powder and that at the time he paid too much attention to his editor's comments rather than trusting his own ideas 44 Other than Tite Kubo Zombie powder had five credited staff though their exact roles in its production were never specified 45 The series was collected into four volumes published in 2000 in Japan 46 47 Zombie powder was licensed for English distribution by Viz Media in 2005 following the success of Tite Kubo's second manga series Bleach 48 The first English volume was released in the United States in September 2006 and the last was released in June 2007 49 50 A French language edition began publication through Tonka min 2013 51 The Viz Media releases preserve the Japanese reading order and overlay the visual sound effects with equivalent English text The English lettering was criticized for being overly large which Anime News Network thought made the characters appear to be shouting at inappropriate moments 2 There are several additional differences between the Japanese and English volume releases of Zombie powder The cover of the second manga volume which featured an illustration of C T Smith holding a gun to his own head was replaced in the English edition with new art of Gamma in sunglasses 52 53 The English editions of volumes 2 4 also each contain a one shot story from early in Kubo's career which were not present in the Japanese collections Ultra Unholy Hearted Machine Rune Master Ur ara and Bad Shield United respectively 53 54 50 These extra stories were included for two apparent reasons to further appeal to Zombie powder 's primary English speaking audience of Bleach fans interested in the development of Tite Kubo's style and to expand the length of the later volumes which would otherwise have been shorter than Viz's normal releases to standard page counts 29 Zombie powder sold modestly in Japan but has been commercially successful in the United States The second volume placed in the top 100 graphic novels for Christmas 2006 56 Theron Martin of Anime News Network believed the series could have achieved some success in the United States without the Bleach connection due to the American market's larger appetite for series which focus on violent action but that the series was heavily buoyed by Bleach's international popularity 2 and primarily imported for an audience of Kubo comp let is ts sic 29 Critical reception of Zombie powder as a whole mostly deemed it mediocre and average Two reviews from Anime News Network ranked it as a C 2 29 it received a C review from Manga Cast 21 a Den of Geek review gave it 3 5 stars 22 and an IGN review concluded it was no better or worse that sic many other sh nen titles with not much to separate it from the massive stock of sh nen series that are similar to it 14 Jason Thompson included it in a list of mediocre sh nen action titles whose clich d nature and ripped off character designs left them interesting only to readers unacquainted with the tropes of the genre 57 The universal criticism in these reviews is that the series as a whole lacks originality with most mentioning that it reads very much like the author's first effort it is and would therefore appeal mostly to fans of the author 2 3 14 21 22 29 While he echoed most individual criticisms of the English language reviewers a divergent conclusion was reached by Russian critic Alexander Gor ban of Anime maniacs Magazine Online who believes that Zombie powder 's fundamentals were all strong and that the failure of the series in Japan was instead due to Tite Kubo's overreach in publishing a series in the highly competitive Weekly Sh nen Jump at such a young age Had the freshman author been serialized in a less prominent magazine asserts Gor ban Zombie powder would have been allowed longer to establish itself and could have developed into a series at least as good as Bleach 3 Reception for individual elements of Zombie powder was more mixed The series premise of seeking magical items was criticized as clich e by ANN and IGN 2 14 but deemed sufficient for the needs of the story by AMO 3 and the parasitic nature of the rings and zombie powder themselves were complimented by Manga Cast and IGN for lending suspense to the plot 14 21 The setting was criticized by ANN and Gor ban a like for not having much effort put into it being too similar to Tri gun and seeming to be chosen just for the sake of coolness 2 3 while IGN liked the mixture of the old west arcane and technological 14 The quality of individual characters in the series was again considered a mixed bag both in artistic design and characterization but with a consensus across reviews that the characters were not developed much beyond their respective tropes 2 3 14 21 29 57 Of all the elements of the series Zombie powder 's action sequences received the most feedback The battle scenes were criticized for their unsophisticated art by Anime News Network with rough drawings and few backgrounds 2 though in its second review ANN noted a guiding philosophy to the background omission elements of the scene which were not props in the fight faded out whenever action began 29 ANN also said that the action was entertainingly violent kinetic well paced easy to follow and interspersed well with comedic moments They ultimately concluded the action was handled better than average but with the disclaimer that the action was the entire sum and substance of the series 2 29 IGN opened their review with a Tite Kubo quote from the first volume's flap The theme is fighting Sitting there and just reading it without thinking is fine But if you ever feel like it please try to use your mind as you read 41 and said that if this advice was taken Zombie powder could be a great sh nen tale but that without it the story was only enjoyable by dissection and comparison to other series 14 Gor ban's view was again the most positive stating that the essential trait of a memorable fight scene is to pit two charismatic figures with contrasting personalities and combat styles against each other and that the series grasped this notion admirably 3 Finally Den of Geek found Zombie powder 's wall to wall action sequences colorful and fun but complained that the sheer mass of them overwhelmed the rest of the story 22",
