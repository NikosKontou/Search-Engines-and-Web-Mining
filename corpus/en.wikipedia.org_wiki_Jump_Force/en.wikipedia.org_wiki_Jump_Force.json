    "transformers_text": "Jump Force is a 2019 crossover fighting game developed by Spike Chunsoft and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment . It features characters from various manga series featured in Shueisha 's Weekly Shōnen Jump anthology in celebration of the magazine's 50th anniversary. [ 1 ] The game was released on February 14, 2019 in Japan for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One , and the following day worldwide in addition to Windows . A Nintendo Switch port was released worldwide on August 28, 2020.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews from critics, with criticism being directed towards its story, gameplay, and failure to deliver its promises upon launch. The game was delisted from all digital storefronts on February 8, 2022, with its online services shutting down on August 24, 2022.\n\nJump Force is a 1-v-1 fighting game where the player controls a team of three characters from a selection of various manga series featured in the Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine. [ 1 ] Players control one character at a time while the others are used as support, with players able to switch between them during battle. Combat functions similarly to the previous Jump fighting game, such as J-Stars Victory VS , Dragon Ball Xenoverse sub-series, Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm sub-series and One Piece: Burning Blood , with players moving around a 3D space and utilizing various combos and special moves to attack their opponents. The match ends when one team depletes the other's health bar.\n\nWhen the real world collides with many of the Shōnen Jump universes, humanity is invaded by the \"Venoms\", an army of mind-controlled villains led by Kane and Galena. In order to fight back, many heroes are recruited to join the \"Jump Force\" under the leadership of Director Glover and his AI partner Navigator. Though, a suspicious figure is using both the Jump Force and the Venoms as an attempt to gain a mysterious artifact and merge all worlds into one. [ 2 ]\n\nFrieza attacks New York City with an army of Venoms, being confronted by Son Goku ; however, a stray laser blast from Frieza fatally wounds a civilian in the war zone. Trunks revives the civilian with a cybernetic device called an umbras cube, giving them the potential to be a hero like them. Frieza withdraws, allowing Goku and Trunks to take the civilian back to their HQ, where they are greeted by Director Glover. Glover explains that the manga worlds from \" Jump \" have somehow begun merging with the real world and using their own umbras cubes to turn evil-hearted humans into Venoms, forcing him to create the Jump Force to quell the threat; the organization consists of heroes from the \"Jump\" worlds, along with other people saved through the cubes.\n\nThe group is divided into Alpha, Beta and Gamma teams; Son Goku leads Alpha (along with Piccolo , Zoro and Gaara ) to fight off the invading Venoms, Luffy leads Beta (along with Boa Hancock , Sanji , Boruto and later Vegeta ) to reclaim the territory from the Venoms, while Naruto leads Gamma (along with Kakashi , Sasuke , Trunks and Sabo ) for stealthy reconnaissance. The new hero, who serves as the game's player character, is asked to join one of the divisions to help repel the invasion. [ 3 ] Light Yagami , whose Death Note lost its powers by the merging of worlds has also joined, secretly intent on restoring it.\n\nThe Jump Force discover other heroes being mind-controlled by umbras cubes charged with evil energy. They free the heroes and recruit them, taking the cubes for inspection, while the recruits join one of the three divisions. Team Alpha is joined by Ichigo Kurosaki, Rukia Kuchiki, Renji Abarai, Yusuke Urameshi, Pharoh Atem, and Asta, Team Beta is joined by Jotaro Kujo, Kenshiro, Ryo Saeba, Kenshin Himura, Kurapika and Izuku Midoriya and Team Gamma is joined by Pegasus Seiya, Dragon Shiryu, Gon Freeces, Killua Zoldyck, Hisoka Morow and Dai. Duplicates of the Jump villains made of the dark umbras cubes also appear, along with the real ones, adding to the confusion, including Frieza, Blackbeard, Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, Cell, Sosuke Aiken, Dio Brando, Toguro and Makoto Shishio.\n\nAfter an amnesiac girl named Angela is rescued, several members of the Jump Force suddenly become possessed by evil auras during missions, leading them to suspect a traitor is among them. While Sanji is initially blamed, the culprit is revealed to be Angela, who is a disguise for the evil Galena. She steals the collected umbras cubes and gives them to her master Kane, a man seeking to wipe out humanity in revenge for the deaths of his family. The player pursues and defeats Kane, but Glover reveals himself as Prometheus, the true mastermind behind the merging of the worlds and Galena's true master, having used Kane to sow chaos across the worlds. Having outlived his usefulness, Galena seemingly kills Kane and proceeds to stall the heroes to allow Prometheus to continue his plans. The heroes defeat Galena, only for Prometheus to absorb her afterward.\n\nThe heroes confront Prometheus, who reveals himself to be a \"keyman\" charged with showing the real world the stories of \"Jump\", but grew tired of humanity's vices and attempts to merge the real and the Jump worlds together in order to guide humanity in the right direction. He steals the player's cube for its good energy, planning to use it to balance the evil energy he collected from the villains to become a god. The villains form a temporary truce with the heroes, while a still-alive Kane uses the last of his strength to give his cube to the player and Goku empowers them further with the energy from all of the Jump Force, allowing them to destroy Prometheus.\n\nHowever, Prometheus's death does not separate the realities, leaving Earth still under threat from the Jump villains. At Trunks' suggestion, the player character becomes the new Jump Force director and continues to protect humanity. Meanwhile, Light finds an umbras cube left behind by Prometheus, planning to use its dark energy to re-power his Death Note.\n\nThe game's launch roster features 40 playable characters from 16 series, with 14 additional characters available as downloadable content via Character Passes and three added as part of a free update for a total of 57 characters. In addition, players are allowed to create their own unique playable character, customizing them with abilities, outfits and accessories earned through gameplay.
