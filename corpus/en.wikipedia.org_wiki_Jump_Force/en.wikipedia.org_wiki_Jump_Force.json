laser blast from Frieza fatally wounds a civilian in the war zone Trunks revives the civilian with a cybernetic device called an umbra s cube giving them the potential to be a hero like them Frieza withdraws allowing Goku and Trunks to take the civilian back to their HQ where they are greeted by Director Glover Glover explains that the manga worlds from Jump have somehow begun merging with the
