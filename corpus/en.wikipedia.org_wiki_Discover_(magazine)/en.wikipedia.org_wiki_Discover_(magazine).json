    "transformers_text": "Discover is an American general audience science magazine launched in October 1980 by Time Inc It is currently owned by Lab X Media Group Discover was created primarily through the efforts of Time magazine editor Leon Jar off He noticed that magazine sales jumped every time the cover featured a science topic Jar off interpreted this as a considerable public interest in science and in 1971 he began agitating for the creation of a science oriented magazine This was difficult as a former colleague noted because Selling science to people who graduated to be managers was very difficult 2 Jar off's persistence finally paid off and Discover magazine published its first edition in 1980 3 Discover was originally launched into a burgeoning market for science magazines aimed at educated non professionals intended to be easier to read than Scientific American but more detailed and science oriented than Popular Science 4 Shortly after its launch the American Association for the Advancement of Science A A AS launched a similar magazine called Science 80 not to be confused with its flagship academic journal Science and both Science News and Science Digest changed their formats to follow the new trend During this period Discover featured fairly in depth science reporting on hard science and avoided fringe topics like extraterrestrial intelligence Most issues contained essays by well known scientists such as Stephen Jay Gould Jared Diamond and Stephen Hawking Another common article was a biography often linked with mentions of other scientists working in the field The Skeptical Eye column sought to uncover pop science scams and was the medium where James Rand i released the results of Project Alpha Jar off said that it was the most read section at its launch 4 The sudden appearance of so many magazines in the same market space inevitably led to some falling by the wayside and Discover was left largely alone in its market space by the mid 1980 s it nevertheless decided to appeal to a wider audience by including articles on psychology and psychiatry Jar off told the editor in chief that these were not solid sciences and was sent back to Discover's parent Time Inc 5 Skeptical Eye and other columns disappeared and articles covered more controversial speculative topics like How the Universe Will End The new format was a great success and the new format remained largely unchanged for the next two decades Gilbert Rog in a Sports Illustrated editor was brought in 1985 to revive Discover In 1986 Time purchased the subscription lists of the shuttered magazines Science Digest and Science 86 from their publishers Circulation for the magazine reached 925 000 by May 1987 with revenue for 1986 being 6 9 million but annual net loss was 10 million 6 In January 1987 Time appointed a new Discover publisher Bruce A Barnet previously publisher of Picture Week test magazine from August 1985 to replace James B Hayes who was appointed publisher of Fortune 7 The magazine changed hands several times In 1987 Time Inc sold Discover to Family Media the owners of Health Golf Illustrated Homeowner 1 001 Home Ideas and World Tennis for 26 million From January to July 1991 Discover magazine lost 15 of its advertising while still remaining profitable Family Media closed down while suspending publication of all its magazines and placing them up for sale Family Media's last Discover issue was August 1991 with a circulation of 1 1 million copies 8 In September 1991 The Walt Disney Company bought the magazine for its Disney Publishing's Magazine Group The magazine's main office was moved to the Magazine Group office in Burbank while leaving one third behind in New York in a small editorial and advertising office Disney was able to retain Family Media's editor in chief for the magazine Paul Hoffman 8 Disney doubled the magazine's photography and its content budget to overcome skipping two issues in Family Media's shutdown and ownership change In 1993 Disney Magazine Publishing Inc decided to launch a trade advertising campaign designed with advertising firm Ziff Marketing to raise awareness in the advertising field that the magazine is an accessible general interest magazine in the science category 9 In October 2005 Bob Guccione Jr founder of Spin and Gear magazines and some private equity partners purchased the magazine from Disney Guccione was CEO and oversaw a redesign for the April 2006 issue However Guccione was ousted as CEO in October 2007 in what was described as a falling out over
