    "transformers_text": "Viz Media LLC is an American entertainment company focused on publishing manga and distribution and licensing Japanese anime films and television series The company was founded in 1986 as Viz LLC In 2005 Viz and ShoP ro Entertainment merged to form the current Viz Media which is owned by Japanese publishing conglomerates Shueisha and Sho gaku kan as well as Japanese production company Sho gaku kan Shueisha Productions ShoP ro 1 In 2017 Viz Media was the largest publisher of graphic novels in the United States in the bookstore market with a 23 share of the market 2 Seiji Hori buch i originally from Tokushima Prefecture in Shikoku Japan moved to California United States in 1975 After living in the suburbs for almost two years he moved to San Francisco where he started a business exporting American cultural items to Japan and became a writer of cultural information He also became interested in publishing Japanese manga in the United States though he himself was not a fan of Japanese comics until a visit to Japan in 1985 exposed him to Katsuhiro O tomo's single volume title Do mu A Child's Dream His idea came to fruition after he met Masahiro Oh ga then managing director of Sho gaku kan in 1985 and shared his vision Sho gaku kan provided Hori buch i with 200 000 in startup capital which Hori bu ichi used in 1986 to found Viz Communications 3 Viz Communications released its first titles in 1987 which included Legend of Kamui however sales were mediocre due to the specialist comic market being averse to venturing into new territory To counteract this problem Viz expanded into the general publishing business and began publishing various art related books in 1992 Into these titles Hori buch i began publishing manga calling them graphic novels so they would be carried by mainstream bookstores The plan worked and after several years leading booksellers began to have dedicated shelves for manga titles Sales also picked up when Viz Communications acquired the license for the comedy series Ranma which became an instant hit 3 The company continued to see success when it expanded into the anime distribution market began publishing Shonen Jump an English adaptation of the popular Japanese magazine Weekly Sh nen Jump It also acquired another huge selling title Inuyasha In the late 1990 s Viz began making the push to move into the European and South American markets 3 When Shueisha became a joint owner of Viz in 2002 4 both Sho gaku kan and Shueisha began to release manga exclusively through Viz Shueisha's deal with Viz may have been prompted by competition with Rai j in Comics a rival manga publisher created in 2002 by editors and artists who had split off from Shueisha taking their properties with them citation needed Some exceptions to this exclusivity exist however Shueisha permitted DC Comics's subsidiary CM X Manga to license Ten j ho Ten ge although it was later re licensed and re released by Viz Media and Kamikaze Kaito Jeanne permitted Dark Horse Comics to license G antz Lady Snow blood Shadow Lady The Monkey King and recently Yasuhiro Night ow's Blood Blockade Battlefront and CLAMP's Gate 7 citation needed Shueisha also permitted Udon Entertainment to license The Rose of Versailles Seven Seas Entertainment to license Hayat e X Blade and will later permit Seven Seas Entertainment to license To Love Ru Yu una and the Haunted Hot Springs and Super Hx Eros and permitted Tokyopop to license Kod och a Marmalade Boy and Digimon Next and Manga Planet to license Silver Fang The Shooting Star G in and allowed Kodansha USA to license the Battle Angel A lita manga in America Sho gaku kan permitted Tokyopop to license Corrector Yui even though Viz Media licensed the anime and Yumi Tsuki ri no's Stitch manga because Tokyopop had the exclusive rights to Disney manga in North America Seven Seas Entertainment to licenseD a i Dark Orb On the Movements of the Earth Polar Bear Cafe and the Him its u Sentai Gore nger manga and Digital Manga to license The Amazing 3 manga by Osamu Tezuka Udon Entertainment to license the In fin i T Force manga even though Viz Media licensed the anime the now defunct Comics One to license Wounded Man The White Haired Demon permitted Dark Horse Comics to license Crying Freeman even though it was previously licensed by Viz New Lone Wolf and Cub however this is because Dark Horse has the original series The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword and Mob Psycho 100 and permitted Hache tte Book Group's subsidiary Yen Press to license A zu manga Dai oh Silver Spoon Kara kai J zu no Takagi san My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU and Cirque du Freak however for Cirque du Freak this is because their sister company publishes the original novels For A zu manga Dai oh Yen Press's license of the manga was a month before Sho gaku kan reprinted the manga in May 2009 resulting in a change of license holders from ASCII Media Works when Yen Press announced the license to Sho gaku kan when Yen Press released it The Yen Press edition is a newly translated and lettered version of ADV Manga's edition taken from ASCII Media Works as opposed to the 3 volume edition by Sho gaku kan Yen Press has expressed interest in releasing the 3 volume edition although editor Kurt Hassle r said he is not sure this will be possible possibly because Sho gaku kan owns Viz and that they almost exclusively license their titles to them In March 2010 Sho gaku kan began a partnership with Fanta graphics Books to issue a line of manga to be edited by Matt Thorn In 2003 possibly in response to Sho gaku kan and Shueisha's co ownership of Viz Japanese publisher Kodansha formed a co venture with Del Rey 5 In 2005 Viz Communications merged with ShoP ro Entertainment an American sub is ida ry of Sho gaku kan and was renamed to Viz Media 6 Hori buch i became the new company's chairman 7 During the same year Hori buch i started a related division Viz Pictures for
