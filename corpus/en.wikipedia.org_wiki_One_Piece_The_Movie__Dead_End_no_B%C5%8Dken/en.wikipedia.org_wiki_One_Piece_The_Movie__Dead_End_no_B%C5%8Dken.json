independently of any Toei Anime Fair event It was released on March 3 2003 Desperate for cash the Straw Hat Pirates enter a secret race between pirate crews known as the Dead End Competition There they must battle against powerful people including the bounty hunter who wants to kill Gaspar de and a climactic battle with marine turned pirate Captain Gaspar de In a port town pub the once again flat broke Straw Hats witness a suspicious exchange between a customer and the proprietor Nami immediately senses money and endeavors to convince the host to give her whatever information he had given him The other Straw Hats join in and soon he is persuaded He shows them to a backdoor behind which they find a long and winding tunnel That tunnel leads to a large underground chamber where a number of pirate crews have a gathering The island they are on turns out to be the starting point of an irregularly occurring anything goes sailing competition For a moment the Straw Hats weigh whether it is wise to join in the race considering that two giants and a crew of fish men who were once the rivals of Ar long's gang were participating as well But once they learn the height of the price money not entering is out of the question From the bookmaker they receive an eternal pose to lead them to the goal of the race Free food is available at the bottom of the chamber and Luffy makes extensive use of it His eating habit of stealing other people's food quickly angers the bounty hunter Shura iy a Basc d Shura iy a Bas uk do as well as a group of men led by Gaspar de Gas up de Gaspar de is a deserted naval officer with a bounty more than three times as high as Luffy's and said to be the race's favorite A fight arises and after Luffy and Shura iy a beat up his men They find themselves standing before the general himself He is impressed with their skill and offers both of them to work under him Of course they refuse but Luffy finds some insulting words to do it and is caught off guard by Gaspar de's right hand man Needles Luffy's courage impresses Gaspar de even more He renews his offer orders Needles to let go of the rookie pirate and leaves the room The next morning a strong ocean current starts the race by pushing the ships upstream over the island As soon as they are over the top the various crews start shooting broadsides board each other's ships and ram their competitors out of the water But once the island is left behind the field quickly clears up leaving the Straw Hats time to eat While inspecting the ship Zoro discovers a boy named An a gum a who had stowed away to earn money by killing some pirate to buy medicine for his adoptive grandfather who works as an engineer on Gaspar de's partially steam powered ship The race continues After fighting yet another rival crew and an encounter with a group of large sea kings they arrive at the island the eternal pose is pointing to The eternal poses were all mis labeled and led the fleet of unsuspecting pirates into reach of the cannons of the navy stronghold N avar one Luffy has no doubt to whose fault it is They turn around and using Chopper's fine nose attempt to catch up with Gaspar de's ship Shura iy a who had followed Gaspar de's invitation to come along on his ship turns against him to take revenge for Gaspar de's killing his parents and sister He fights Needles and throws him over board but stands no chance against Gaspar de's Logia type powers which allow him to turn parts or all of his body into liquid or solid candy The general is about to kill the bounty hunter when the Straw Hats arrive and catch his attention Luffy confronts him and the two engage in a fierce but one sided battle Any attack Luffy throws at his opponent causes his limbs to get stuck in Gaspar de's
