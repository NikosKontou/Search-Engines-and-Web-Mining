    "transformers_text": "The 2024–25 NBA season was the 79th season of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The regular season began on October 22, 2024, and ended on April 13, 2025. [ 1 ] The NBA held an in-season tournament for the second consecutive year, now called the Emirates NBA Cup . [ 2 ] The 2025 NBA All-Star Game was played on February 16, 2025, at Chase Center in San Francisco . [ 3 ] The play-in tournament was played from April 15 to 18, 2025, followed by the playoffs the next day, and concluded with the finals on June 22, 2025, when the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Indiana Pacers in seven games . Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was named the Finals MVP. This was the first game 7 in the finals since 2016 , and the 20th overall.\n\nThe first round of the 2024 NBA draft took place on June 26, 2024, at Barclays Center in Brooklyn , New York. The second round took place the next day at ESPN's Seaport District Studios in Manhattan . [ 15 ] [ 16 ]\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks take French teen Zaccharie Risacher as the #1 overall pick.\n\nFree agency negotiations began on June 30, 2024, at 6 p.m. ET. Players were officially signed after the July moratorium on July 6 at 12 p.m. ET.\n\nIn addition to regular preseason games hosted at NBA teams' own arenas, the NBA often hosts neutral site preseason games (either in domestic non-NBA markets or foreign markets) or against non-NBA teams. Listed below are only those neutral site or preseason games.\n\nThe majority of the regular season was released on August 15, with those group play games counting as part of the in-season tournament, now branded as the NBA Cup , announced two days earlier on August 13. The two games that were dependent on the results of the in-season tournament, along with the knockout round schedule, were announced at the conclusion of group play ( see details below ). [ 45 ] [ 1 ]\n\nThe Spurs played two alternate-site games at the Moody Center at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas in February, when the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo took over Frost Bank Center.\n\nThe NBA Cup , formerly the In-season tournament, returned for the 2024–25 season, with the same structure: [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 45 ]\n\nNotes\n\nThe top six seeds in each conference advanced to the main rounds of the 2025 NBA playoffs , while the next four seeds participated in a Page playoff system tournament from April 15–18, 2025. In each conference: The 7th-place team hosted the 8th-place team in the double-chance round needing to win one game to advance, with the winner clinching the 7th seed in the playoffs. The 9th-place team hosted the 10th-place team in the elimination round requiring two wins to advance, with the loser being eliminated from the contention. The loser in the double-chance round hosted the elimination-round game-winner, with the winner clinching the 8th seed and the loser being eliminated. [ 55 ]\n\nBold Game winner Italic Team with home-court advantage * Division winner\n\nBold Game winner Italic Team with home-court advantage * Division winner\n\nThe playoffs began on April 19, 2025.\n\nBold Series winner Italic Team with home-court advantage * Division winner\n\nThe following players were named the Eastern and Western Conference Players of the Week.\n\nThe following players were named the Eastern and Western Conference Players of the Month.\n\nThe following players were named the Eastern and Western Conference Defensive Players of the Month.\n\nThe following players were named the Eastern and Western Conference Rookies of the Month .\n\nThe following coaches were named the Eastern and Western Conference Coaches of the Month.\n\nThis was the last season of a nine-year deal with the ESPN family of networks , TNT Sports , and NBA TV , before new 11-year deals with ESPN/ ABC , NBC/Peacock and Amazon Prime Video begin in 2025–26 . TNT , in its final year of NBA coverage, has aired live NBA games since 1989. [ 109 ] [ 110 ] The NBA rejected TNT Sports' matching rights offer for Amazon's package, claiming TNT was unable to fully match the terms of Amazon's all-streaming contract. TNT then filed a lawsuit against the league in a Manhattan New York state court, seeking to delay the new media deals from taking effect and to rule that TNT's offer matched Amazon's deal. [ 111 ] In November, the two parties agreed to a settlement, with TNT acquiring live game rights in selected international territories, and entering into a separate sublicensing agreement with The Walt Disney Company (parent company of ESPN and ABC) to broadcast TNT's Inside the NBA studio on ESPN/ABC in 2025–26. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] TNT Sports later announced in June 2025 that it would no longer operate NBA's digital properties, including NBA TV and the NBA.com website, effective October 1. [ 114 ]\n\nThe Chicago Bulls, the NHL 's Chicago Blackhawks , MLB 's Chicago White Sox , and Standard Media launched the Chicago Sports Network prior to the start of this season, replacing NBC Sports Chicago as their regional broadcaster. [ 130 ] [ 131 ]\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers and Root Sports mutually agreed to end their television agreement prior to the season. [ 132 ] On September 23, 2024, the Trail Blazers announced that they had signed a multi-year agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group to be their new broadcaster. Under the deal, KATU and KUNP were named as the flagship stations, the group of over-the-air stations carrying games across the team's broadcast territory was branded as the Rip City Television Network , and games stream locally on a new direct-to-consumer streaming service named BlazerVision . [ 133 ]\n\nAltitude Sports and Entertainment , the television home of the Denver Nuggets, reached an agreement with Tegna Inc. to simulcast 20 games on KTVD in Denver. Select games are being simulcast on KUSA . [ 134 ]\n\nThis is the first season that the Gotham Sports App, owned by a joint venture between MSG Networks and YES Network , became the exclusive streaming home of the Knicks and Nets. The app will not change the television rights for these teams. [ 135 ]\n\nDiamond Sports Group , the parent company of the regional sports network chain FanDuel Sports Network (formerly Bally Sports), has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since March 2023. As part of the bankruptcy, on August 23, 2024, Diamond Sports signed a long-term agreement with thirteen of the NBA teams that it holds rights to, committing to broadcast their games through at least the 2024–25 season, but with a 30 to 40 percent reduction in their rights fees. Despite being a long-term deal, if Diamond Sports is unable to get a bankruptcy plan approved by the court, the agreement will expire following the end of the season. [ 136 ] [ 137 ]\n\nDiamond also terminated its contracts with the Dallas Mavericks and New Orleans Pelicans , [ 136 ] [ 137 ] and both teams would sign with over-the-air broadcasters. The Mavericks signed a multi-year agreement with Tegna Inc. as their broadcaster, with KFAA (formerly KMPX) and WFAA as flagship stations. [ 138 ] [ 139 ] Meanwhile, the Pelicans announced a new agreement with Gray Television , under which games will be broadcast by the new Gulf Coast Sports & Entertainment Network , with WVUE-DT in New Orleans as flagship. [ 140 ]\n\nOn October 21, Bally Sports rebranded as FanDuel Sports Network , after Diamond ended its sponsorship agreements with Bally's Corporation and entered into a new agreement with online gambling company FanDuel Group . [ 141 ] [ 142 ]\n\nAlong with airing on FanDuel Sports Network, the Bucks, Cavaliers, Grizzlies, Hawks, Hornets, Pacers, Pistons, Thunder and Timberwolves also announced agreements to simulcast five games on local over-the-air networks . The Bucks will air games on Weigel Broadcasting -owned WMLW-TV (in English) and WYTU-LD (in Spanish). [ 143 ] The Cavaliers will air games on Gray Media -owned Rock Entertainment Sports Network and WUAB . [ 144 ] The Grizzlies will air games on Gray Media -owned WMC-TV , WSMV-TV and WBXX-TV . [ 145 ] The Hawks will air games on Gray Media owned- WPCH-TV and Peachtree Sports Network .

[ 152 ]\n\nOn January 2, 2025, Diamond emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and rebranded themselves as the Main Street Sports Group . [ 153 ]\n\nESPN analyst JJ Redick left the network to became head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. He was initially replaced by a cast of rotating analysts joining Mike Breen and Doris Burke on the network's lead announce team. [ 154 ] On February 24, ESPN announced that Richard Jefferson will remain with Breen and Burke for the rest of the season. [ 155 ]\n\nESPN analyst Hubie Brown announced his retirement at the end of the season. Brown has called games for ESPN since 2004 and previously called games for USA Network , CBS and TNT. [ 156 ] He called his last game on February 9, 2025, during the 76ers–Bucks game. [ 157 ]\n\nThe Boston Celtics promoted backup TV play-by-play announcer Drew Carter to full time this season following the retirement of Mike Gorman . Carter was hired by the team soon after Gorman announced his retirement prior to the start of 2023–24 ; Gorman primarily called Celtics home games during his final season while Carter primarily called away games. [ 158 ]\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs hired Jacob Tobey to be their new TV play-by-play announcer this season following the retirement of Bill Land. Tobey previously held play-by-play roles with Fox Sports and the Pac-12 Network . [ 159 ]\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers home game on March 3, as well as the Boston Celtics home game on March 5, was called by Mike Tirico , in preparation for his new role as the lead play-by-play announcer on NBC next season. These games marked the first time Tirico called NBA games since the 2015–16 season , while at ESPN. [ 160 ]\n\nThe 2024–25 NBA teams by average home attendance:",
