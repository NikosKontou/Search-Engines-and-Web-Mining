unique monthly visitors 30 Following his appointment Vogel's overall plan for About focused on social mobile and user experience with an emphasis on increasing the amount of time that users remain on the site rather than attracting people in the first instance 30 Vogel also stressed the importance of monet iz ation in his numerous post appointment interviews and he included a summary of About's revenue model as part of his discussion of the future with Bloomberg We make money one way in general we're advertising supported And that's monet i zed two ways we do a lot of display advertising and we do a lot of people clicking on links that we get paid for from Google and others If we have all this traffic and we have all this content if we can make people engage with content more and spend more time here About com and do more things we're going to have more page views and much more of an opportunity to monet ize About 31 Vogel further explained that IAC has been able to create compelling content that manages to successfully engage Internet users while About's content in particular is favoured by the Google search engine 31 Furthermore Vogel stated that native advertising is a marketing initiative that he would like to explore with caution as it's a really big opportunity to let marketers talk to our audience in the voice that they're already comfortable with 32 In April 2014 Vogel revealed to the media that the About com team had grown from 100 employees to 176 and the number of site contributors had increased by 20 percent The company's developers updated the
