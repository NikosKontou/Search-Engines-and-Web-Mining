    "transformers_text": "Avex Trax ( Japanese : エイベックス トラックス , Hepburn : Eibekkusu Torakkusu ) is a record label owned by Japanese entertainment conglomerate Avex Inc. The label was launched in September 1990, and was the first label by the Group. [ 1 ]\n\nTwo years after Max Matsuura began a career distributing studio albums from other countries, he and his two Avex co-founders, Tom Yoda and Ken Suzuki, decided to found their own label. Aiming to compete with more established labels such as Nippon Columbia , Nippon Crown , BMG Victor , Victor Musical Industries , Toshiba-EMI , CBS/Sony , Teichiku Records , King Records , Nippon Phonogram and PolyGram K.K. , they created the Avex Trax label.\n\nThe first artist to sign to the label was the band TRF , which became a success. This led to Avex Trax becoming a \"house of refuge\" for artists who had left their former labels (e.g. Bananarama from Polydor K.K. , Ayumi Hamasaki from Nippon Columbia, Namie Amuro from Toshiba-EMI, Ami Suzuki from Sony Music Japan ). [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] It also appealed to artists not content with their current labels (e.g. Gackt from Nippon Crown). [ 5 ]\n\nFormerly distributed by Sohbi Corporation [ ja ] until 1992 [ 6 ] and then by the Nippon Crown label from 1992 on, in 1997 Avex became a self-distributed label together with Cutting Edge , which was formerly distributed by Toshiba-EMI.",
