that the series ' characters have a lot of charm 139 His colleague Carl Kimlinger describes the visual style of One Piece as unconventional with grotesquely exaggerated expressions simple eyes big mouths and bigger teeth supremely ugly supporting characters and skinny gangly limbed main cast and comments that it's all amazingly distinctive utterly appropriate and surprisingly cool in a goofy kind of way He also notes that Funimation's English dub is light years better than the 4 Kids debacle unusually accurate professional and largely enjoyable which is far far more than can be said of the previous dub He laments that Funimation's version of Crocodile loses his sepulchral charisma and that the original's fine dance on the edge of mawkish sentimentality is disrupted often enough by less than stellar acting He also states that Colleen Clink en beard's Luffy is more a generic spunky kid than a personality in his own right really coming to life only during the action scenes during
