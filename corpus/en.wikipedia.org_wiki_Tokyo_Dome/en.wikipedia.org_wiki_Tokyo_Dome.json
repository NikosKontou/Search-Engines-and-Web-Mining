    "transformers_text": "Site: 112,456 m 2 (27.788 acres) Building: 46,755 m 2 (503,270 sq ft) Internal height: 56 m (184 ft) Field: 13,000 m 2 (140,000 sq ft) Left/right field – 100 m (330 ft) Left/right-center – 110 m (360 ft) Center field – 122 m (400 ft) Capacity: 1,240,000 m 3 (43.8 million cubic feet)\n\nTokyo Dome ( 東京ドーム , Tōkyō Dōmu ) is an indoor stadium in Bunkyō , Tokyo, Japan. It was designed as a baseball stadium following its predecessor, Korakuen Stadium (whose former site is now occupied by the Tokyo Dome Hotel and a plaza for this stadium). In Japan, it is often used as a unit of size; for example, \"the new construction is five times the size of Tokyo Dome.\"\n\nConstruction on the stadium began on May 16, 1985, and it opened on March 17, 1988. It was built on the site of the Velodrome, adjacent to Korakuen Stadium and the Koishikawa-Kōrakuen garden. It has a maximum total capacity of 57,000 depending on configuration, with an all-seating configuration of 42,000. [ 7 ] [ 3 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]\n\nTokyo Dome's original nickname was \"The Big Egg\", with some calling it the \"Tokyo Big Egg\". [ 10 ] Its dome-shaped roof is an air-supported structure , a cable-reinforced 0.8 mm flexible fiberglass membrane supported by slightly pressurizing the inside of the stadium [ 11 ] with 150,000 m 3 /hour [ 12 ] using independent blowers. [ 13 ] It was developed by Nikken Sekkei and Takenaka Corporation , [ 1 ] and modeled after the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome . [ 10 ]\n\nIt is the home field of the Yomiuri Giants baseball team. On March 18, 1988, the day after Tokyo Dome opened, the Yomiuri Giants held a game which was the first event in Tokyo Dome. [ 14 ] The Yomiuri Giants host about 70 games a year at their home stadium, Tokyo Dome, and other Nippon Professional Baseball teams sometimes host several games a year at Tokyo Dome. If the Yomiuri Giants advance to the Climax Series or the Japan Series , additional games will be held at Tokyo Dome. Interleague play , in which the Yomiuri Giants participate, will also be held at Tokyo Dome. In 2021, the Tokyo Yakult Swallows advanced to the Japan Series, but they held the Japan Series at Tokyo Dome instead of their home stadium, Meiji Jingu Stadium . This was because the Japan Series had to be rescheduled due to the spread of COVID-19 infectious disease, and the dates overlapped with the game days of amateur baseball tournaments at Meiji Jingu Stadium. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Tokyo Dome is also the location of the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame which chronicles the history of baseball in Japan . [ 18 ]\n\nIt has also hosted international baseball tournaments such as the World Baseball Classic and WBSC Premier12 , Major League Baseball , music concerts , basketball , American football , association football games, puroresu (pro-wrestling) matches, mixed martial arts events, kickboxing events, and monster truck races. It became the first Japanese venue with an American football attendance above 50,000. [ 19 ]\n\nTokyo Dome is part of a greater entertainment complex known as Tokyo Dome City , built of the grounds of the former Tokyo Koishikawa Arsenal . Tokyo Dome City includes an amusement park and Tokyo Dome City Attractions (formerly Kōrakuen Grounds). This amusement park occupies the former Korakuen Stadium site and includes a roller coaster named Thunder Dolphin and a hubless Ferris wheel . The grounds also have an onsen called Spa LaQua, various shops, restaurants, video game centers, the largest JRA WINS horse race betting complex in Tokyo, and Oft Korakuen , which caters to rural horse races.\n\nTokyo Dome has been selected as one of the baseball stadiums to host international baseball tournaments since the 2000s. Tokyo Dome has been selected to host all six World Baseball Classics through 2026. It has also been selected three times to host the WBSC Premier 12 finals.\n\nTokyo Dome has held various Major League Baseball games to open the seasons, with the first series—a two-game slate between the Chicago Cubs and New York Mets in 2000 —being the first time American MLB teams have played regular season games in Asia. Four years later, the New York Yankees , featuring former Yomiuri Giants slugger/outfielder Hideki Matsui in their lineup, and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays played two games in the stadium to start the 2004 season . The Boston Red Sox and the Oakland Athletics opened the 2008 MLB season in Japan, and also competed against Japanese teams. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] To open the 2012 season the Seattle Mariners and the Athletics, the former of which had Ichiro Suzuki , played a two-game series on March 28–29. In game one Seattle – led by Ichiro's 4 hits – won 3–1 in 11 innings. [ 22 ] The Mariners and Athletics returned to Tokyo Dome for a two-game series to begin the 2019 Major League Baseball season , with Ichiro retiring from professional baseball after the second game. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] On July 18, 2024, Major League Baseball announced that the 2025 MLB season will open with a two game series March 18-19 at Tokyo Dome between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Chicago Cubs . [ 25 ]\n\nThe Tokyo Dome Corporation publishes a list of singers and music groups that have performed since its opening in 1988. The Alfee held its first concert at Tokyo Dome on March 19 and 20, 1988, two days after the dome opened. On March 22 and 23, 1988, Mick Jagger became the first non-Japanese artist to perform at Tokyo Dome. [ 26 ]\n\nConcerts have been held at Tokyo Dome for several dozen days each year since its opening, mainly by Japanese singers and music groups. According to official statistics from its opening in 1988 to December 2024, KinKi Kids held the most solo concerts at Tokyo Dome for 66 days, followed by Arashi for 58 days and Kanjani Eight (Super Eight) for 44 days.
