the album in entirety was released by Netflix Music on September 1 2023 The soundtrack featured a diverse range of genres from rap hip hop to orchestral music Sonya Belo usova and Gion a O stine lli were hired to compose the score for the series 1 After providing music for the first season of the Netflix series The Witcher the duo wanted the next project to have a musical world building and when they first heard about the live action adaptation of the manga series One Piece they immediately agreed to be onboard for the project Composition began in late November and December 2021 where they shot a three and half minute video analyzing the pitch and the outline of the concept and the basic sketches of the series ' music where each character had their own distinct instrumentation 2 3 Belo usova and O stine lli recorded the score with 110 musicians at the Abbey Road Studios which included 23 orchestral sessions held for 82 hours and over 3 667 takes The initial music consisted of 180 cues running for seven hours and the final existing length consisted of 79 themes running for four hours 4 The first track from the album Wealth Fame Power 5 connects Luffy with Gold Roger's legacy 6 The song has ascending motion as Luffy is at the start of his journey so in Roger's scene they reversed the theme to be in descending motion as Rogers is about to be executed we are ending one storyline but we are immediately beginning another storyline 7 She used a hurdy gurdy for the theme an instrument which they experimented on The Witcher and virtuoso flamenco guitar played by guitarist Marcin Pat rza lek 8 Additionally the themes of the other members of the Straw Hat Pirates were blended into Luffy's theme since Luffy serves as the crew's captain 2 For Zoro's character the duo decided on using each instrument representing the sword with one sword being represented by the ban suri and the other being represented with the beat box type music that determines the bursts of breath and the 42 inch frame drum was used highlighting as the perfect instrument for Zoro while the Wado Ichi mon ji sword which Zoro had a historic connection is represented by duduk as it had a mystical and sacred color to it Sanji's character was represented with a jazzy music which insisted for a big band jazz ensemble performing the jazz theme Us opp's theme was represented with an ukulele in the initial season establishing his character from the first episode and then grows in sound with the 12 string guitar performing Us opp's theme 2 9 Nami's theme features a flute and initially plays in a very kind of fun determined quirky manner but as the character is explored more in depth over the season the theme reappears in different shades 9 The album's second single My Sails Are Set featuring Norwegian singer Aurora is a lyrical song rendition of Nami's theme 9 this iteration external ize s Nami's journey and acts as the culmination of the series ' musical ideas On the development of this song Belo usova commented that usually songs function as needle drops it's very rare for songs to have actually any sort of musical connection to the rest of the score 10 Mixtape from Bara tie is the second soundtrack to the series that featured musical themes and instrumentals heard at the pirate restaurant Bara tie Performed by the One Piece Big Band ensemble along with jazz soloists it was released on September 8 2023 11 Matt Patches of Polygon highlighted that showrunner s Matt Owens and Steven Maeda did not give Belo usova and O stine lli picture locked episodes to add underscore to but instead tasked them with composing a world's worth of sounds that could be in constant conversation depending on which eccentric characters or pirate y locations were in play at any given moment 10 Collider's Are zo u Amin stated that s how's music strikes a kind of nostalgic adventuring tone with the nostalgia due to how jaunty it is 12 Kirsten Carey for The Mary Sue viewed the score as fun but also highly repetitive 13 Carey criticized it for playing over 90 of a given episode and suggested one could make a drinking game out of how many times the main theme plays per episode outside of the title 13 Matt Owen for Guitar World opined that Mi hawk's theme was a quintessential performance by Marcin Pat rza lek as it is smothered with the classical and flamenco motifs that nod to his early roots all while upping the ante with behind the nut strums off the cuff tuning peg dive bombs and of course a healthy dose of body knocks for additional percussive flair 14",
