    "transformers_text": "Diamond Comic Distributors Inc often called Diamond Comics DCD or casually Diamond is an American comic book distributor serving retailers in North America and worldwide It transported comic books and graphic novels as well as other popular culture products such as toys games and apparel from comic book publishers or suppliers to retailers before bankruptcy in 2025 It is owned by Ge ppi Family Enterprises which is also the parent company of Gemstone Publishing E Gerber Products Diamond International Galleries Hake's American a Collectibles Morphy's Auctions the Ge ppi's Entertainment Museum and Baltimore magazine On May 16 th 2025 the publishing arm and other subsidiaries of Diamond were sold to Sparkle Pop a subsidiary of Ad Pop ul um while Alliance Game Distributors was sold to Universal Distribution The acquisition included several companies under the Ge ppi Family Enterprises umbrella Diamond's publishing arm was also the publisher of Previews a monthly catalog magazine showcasing upcoming comic books graphic novels toys and other pop culture merchandise Diamond UK was sold to its management team Diamond Comic Distributors Inc itself remains a separate entity involved in bankruptcy proceedings In 1982 Baltimore based comics retailer Steve Ge ppi founded Diamond Comic Distributors Diamond became the successor to direct sales pioneer Phil Seu ling's distribution dream when it took over New Media Ir j a x's warehouses in 1982 Diamond further bought out early distributor Bud Plant Inc in 1988 and main rival Capital City Distribution in 1996 to assume a near monopoly on comics distribution including exclusivity deals with the major comic book publishers By 1981 1982 Ge ppi had four comics retail locations and was already doing a little informal distributing for smaller retailers 1 Ge ppi found himself one of the biggest accounts for New Media Ir j a x 1 and when the distributor relocated to Florida he asked Ge ppi to service more accounts for a bigger discount 1 One of the last loyal customers when New Media began having fiscal difficulties Ge ppi made a deal t he owner was going into retail so Ge ppi agreed to provide New Media Ir j a x with free books for a period of time in return for his account list buying parts of the company and founding Diamond Comic Distribution 1 Ge ppi had been a sub distributor for Hal Shuster's Ir j a x in the late 1970 s 2 In what Mile High Comics ' Chuck Ro zan ski describes as an incredibly risky and gutsy move Ge ppi took over New Media Ir j a x's office and warehouse space and recalled Ro zan ski had to sort out the good customers from the bad overnight negotiating with creditors to continue Shuster's distribution business as Diamond Comic Distribution 3 Almost overnight noted Ro zan ski h e went from being a retailer in Baltimore to having warehouses all over the place 3 Ge ppi named his new company ' Diamond ' after the imprint Marvel Comics used on non returnable comics and although the publisher discontinued the symbol months later the name remained 1 Diamond grew an average of 40 percent a year as comics retail took off 1 In 1983 Diamond hired an accounting firm In 1985 Diamond hired no nonsense CPA Chuck Parker as Diamond's first controller 1 In 1994 Diamond employee Mark Herr noted that this move was Ge ppi's best decision as Parker cares nothing about the comics To him it's dollars and cents 1 Parker describes his role as smooth ing the emotion out of some decisions Steve Ge ppi is a visionary and a risk taker and I tend to be more conservative 1 After starting his business through buying New Media Ir j a x's warehouses and offices in 1982 Ge ppi's distribution company has bought out many other distribution companies since Many fans with little experience started rival distribution companies only to find they were in over their heads allowing Ge ppi to buy out the smart ones or pick up the pieces after the stupid ones went out of business according to Herr 1 Diamond was aided in his efforts by the publishers themselves In the early 1980 s Marvel Comics and DC Comics provided trade terms favorable for larger distributors and those with efficient freight systems effectively play ing into the hands of the major distributors such as Capital and Diamond and hastening the demise of smaller distributors 2 In 1988 Previews Diamond's monthly magazine showcasing upcoming comic books was first published 4 Most notably in 1988 Ge ppi bought up early mail order distributor Bud Plant Inc 5 who had himself bought out Charles A bar Distribution in 1982 6 Plant had since 1970 been selling underground comics a field which Ge ppi and fellow distributor Buddy Saunders had tended to steer clear of 6 After making 19 m in sales in 1987 Diamond bought West Coast distributor Plant's business 7 in 1988 and went national 1 there by assuming control of 40 percent of the direct sales market 6 Diamond and Capital City Distribution had control of at least 70 between them In 1990 Diamond acquired Oregon based Second Genesis Distribution 4 whose operations folded in 1991 8 Second Genesis had previously absorbed distributors Sunrise Distributors and Come x One week after announcing the acquisition of Second Genesis Diamond announced the acquisition of the Seattle based sub distributor Destiny Distribution 4 9 Destiny had been started by Phil Pankow in the early 1980 s and was initially supplied by Bud Plant In 1991 Diamond moved into the UK market acquiring Neptune Comic Distributors Ltd to whom they had formerly supplied US comics for the UK market in the process creating Diamond UK In 1993 Diamond acquired the single remaining dominant British distributor Titan Distributors 10 thus cornering the direct market in the United Kingdom 11 In 1994 Diamond acquired Staten Island based distributor Comics Unlimited 4 By this point Diamond had 27 warehouses in the U S Canada and the U K employ ing between 750 and 900 people operated its own trucking line and controlled 45 of the market making 222 million in sales 1 In 1996 Diamond launched the toll free Comic Shop Locator service 4 In 1995 Marvel Comics challenged Diamond and main rival Capital City by buying the third largest distributor Heroes World Distribution and distributing its titles in house after taking over from Curtis Circulation 12 On April 26 1995 Diamond reacted by outbidding Capital City for exclusive deals with Marvel's main rivals DC Comics 13 Dark Horse and Image on July 24 and Valiant Comics in August 14 Capital City's response saw it sign exclusive deals with Kitchen Sink Press and Viz Comics but a year later faced the choice between bankruptcy and selling out Diamond bought Capital City on July 26 1996 assuming near control of the comics distribution system 12 15 16 The purchase price was not disclosed but the acquisition brought an estimated 50 million in sales revenue to Diamond 15 In early 1997 when Marvel's Heroes World endeavor failed Diamond also forged an exclusive deal with Marvel after the publisher's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 1996 17 giving the company its own section of comics catalog Previews not least because the DC Dark Horse Image deal gave contractual prominence to those companies making Ge ppi the sole king of comics industry distribution in the summer of 1996 3 In 1997 Diamond's position in the comics industry as the sole source of most new comics products to comics specialty shops ultimately saw the company become the subject of an investigation by the U S Justice department for possible antitrust violations 2 The Justice Department launched an antitrust investigation into the comics industry and the alleged monopoly of Diamond Comics The investigation was closed in November 2000 with no further action deemed necessary 18 19 on the basis that although Diamond enjoyed a monopoly in the North American comic book direct market distribution they did not enjoy a monopoly on book distribution books including non comic books In addition to having cornered the American comics distribution market Diamond includes a number of subsidiary and affiliated companies UK and European comics distribution is served by Diamond UK based in Runcorn England 20 On August 31 2000 Diamond Comic Distributors acquired Alliance Game Distributors North America's largest distributor of table top games 21 In 2002 Diamond consolidated its book trade into Diamond Book Distributors marketing graphic novels and trade paperbacks to bookstores including Barnes Noble Ingram Baker Taylor Amazon com and Borders 20 On March 23 2020 Ge ppi announced that Diamond would stop sending comics to retail shops until further notice and had instructed printers not to send any new shipments to the company due to the C OVID 19 pandemic Issues of comics with United States release dates of April 1 or later and with United Kingdom release dates of March 25 or later would not be shipped until normal operations resumed 22 The shutdown took effect on April 1 2020 and ended on May 20 23 On June 5 2020 DC Comics announced that they would discontinue their distribution agreement with Diamond and that their books would now be distributed by Penguin Random House for their graphic novels and by UC S Comic Distributors subsidiary of Midtown Comics and Lunar Distribution subsidiary of Discount Comic Book Service in Fort Wayne Indiana While acknowledging how huge the decision was DC reiterated that the move was intended to fortify and increase the viability of the comic book direct market while also widening its fan base 24 On March 25 2021 Marvel Comics announced they plan to shift their direct market distribution for both monthly comics and graphic novels to Penguin Random House The change was implemented on October 1 2021 in a multi year partnership Unlike DC Comics ' complete split Marvel will still be giving stores the option to order comics from Diamond but Diamond will be acting as a wholesaler rather than distributor 25 On September 17 2021 IDW Publishing announced a new deal with Penguin Random House to distribute newly published and back list comic book periodicals trade collections and graphic novels to the Direct Market comic shops beginning June 1 2022 The deal is non exclusive allowing retailers to choose ordering from Penguin Random House directly or from Diamond as a wholesaler rather than a distributor in the US and the UK 26 On January 14 2025 Diamond filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to facilitate the restructuring of its operations The company received a 39 millions talking horse bid to sell off Alliance Game Distributors to Canadian based hobby distributor Universal Distribution 27 Alliance Entertainment ultimately won the bid to acquire Diamond's assets in March but later backed out after filing multiple lawsuits against the company 28 A joint bid between Universal Distribution and Ad Pop ul um was then approved and finalized in May 2025 Universal acquired the assets of Alliance Game Distributors while Ad Pop ul um acquired Diamond Comic Distributors Diamond Book Distributors Diamond Select Toys Collectibles Collectible Grading Authority and other assets Diamond UK was not included in this sale 28 29 30 Major layoffs at Diamond were reported soon after including the shutdown of Diamond Select Toys 31 32 Penguin Random House ended its sub distributor agreement with Diamond ending its distribution of comics from Marvel Comics Dark Horse Comics IDW Publishing BOOM Studios and others 28 33 34 By the end of May Udon Entertainment had ceased shipments to Diamond 35 Dynamite Entertainment ceased shipments to Diamond and shifted to Lunar Distribution in mid June 36 By July Diamond's Comic Suite POS and Pull Box pre ordering system were shut down 37 Diamond's existing inventory was not included in the sale so the old company began selling it without paying publishers There are nearly 130 companies affected including Fan at a graphics and Dynamite which is owned over 1 million and in danger of not meeting payroll 38 39 40 41 The Collectible Grading Authority one of Diamond's smaller assets and a rival to Certified Guaranty Company was later purchased by a consortium of investors in July 2025 41 Diamond UK was sold in September 2025 for about 2 million as part of a management buyout 42 The main company Diamond Comic Distributors Inc itself still remains a separate independent entity involved in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case 43 In 1983 Diamond was criticized for taking exception to certain adult themed titles and scenes effectively causing the cancellation of a series called Void Indigo for its excessive violence citation needed In 1987 Ge ppi responded to a graphic childbirth scene in Miracle man 9 written by Alan Moore Ge ppi wrote to retailers that Diamond values its retailers too much to take chances on such a dangerous situation We are not censors We no more want someone deciding for us than you do We cannot however stand by and watch the marketplace become a dumping ground for every sort of graphic fantasy that someone wants to live out We have an industry to protect we have leases to abide by we have a community image to maintain 3 This call for retailers to refuse to stock Miracle man 44 led to accusations of censorship 45 charges the company was forced to address when it criticized or refused to carry other titles including books by Kitchen Sink Press 46 Dave Sim in 1988 46 47 48 49 Jon Lewis in 1994 50 and Mike Diana in 1996 51 Diamond lost customers with this approach however and eventually backed down 1 Ge ppi recalls compromising and accepting that as a distributor I owed the retailers the product they wanted 1 In fact in an attempt to prove Diamond did not practice censorship the company joined DC Comics in 1993 to raise money for the industry's First Amendment advocacy group Comic Book Legal Defense Fund 52 Because of its industry dominance Diamond also faced charges it bullied publishers 53 and discriminated against small publishers These charges first surfaced in 1988 when Diamond rejected Matt Fe az ell's comic Ant Boy 54 55 and in 1989 when it similarly decided not to carry Allen Freeman's Slam Bang anthology 56 After the industry consolidation of 1996 Diamond faced similar charges in 1996 51 1999 57 and 2000 when smaller publishers like Fanta graphics and Drawn Quarterly lodged complaints 58 59 60 61 Diamond's monthly comics retail catalog Previews had been produced by Diamond for over 25 years for store owners and comic shop customers to order their products It was additionally available for sale to customers to facilitate pre orders from pull and hold or subscription customers who frequent comic shops on a regular basis Comics publishers vied for space within the publication's pages with Dark Horse DC Comics Image Comics and IDW Publishing taking precedence as Premier publishers Marvel Comics has its own mini catalog of Marvel Previews available separately for contractual reasons The print Previews catalog was discontinued in 2025 June with the final digital catalog being 2025 October catalog Previews 445 for items in shops in December or later 62 Ge ppi is also owner of Gemstone Publishing Inc through which he publishes The Over street Comic Book Price Guide 63 Gemstone has also published Russ Cochran ' sEC Comics reprints Disney comics and Blue Book price guide in the past as well In 1994 Ge ppi purchased Baltimore magazine 64 a 50 000 circulation monthly and one of the nation's oldest regional publications 63 Ge ppi's publishing ventures in the comics field saw him create Gemstone Publishing Inc which was formed in large part from other purchases In 1992 Diamond bought Ernst Gerber Publishing publisher author of the Photo Journal Guide to Comics 3 E Gerber Products LLC is a Diamond affiliated company started by Gerber in 1977 which sells My lar bags as well as acid free boxes and acid free backing boards for comics collectors to store their collection in 20 In 1993 Ge ppi bought Russ Cochran Publishing 3 Long term EC Comics fan Cochran auctioned Bill Gaines ' personal file copies of EC publications as well as most pages of original EC artwork which almost uniquely Gaines had maintained ownership and possession of before being granted the reprint rights to the EC back catalog itself Ge ppi included Cochran's publications and Cochran himself under his new imprint Gemstone Publishing 63 In 1994 Ge ppi bought Over street Publishing taking up the publishing reins of official Blue Book price guide The Over street Comic Book Price Guide and other related publications bringing them under the Gemstone imprint 3 Ge ppi's publishing activities with Gemstone Publishing consist primarily of reprints of classic titles and artworks as well as publications including professional fanzines pro zines focusing heavily on the history of the comics medium Many Gemstone publications revolve around Comic Book Marketplace editor and EC shepherd Russ Cochran Cochran like Ge ppi was a particular fan of Carl Barks ' Disney comics and had previously published EC reprints in association with Disney re printer Gladstone Publishing In the early 1990 s Ge ppi's Gemstone embarked on a full series of reprints of classic EC titles starting with new reprints of the Cochran Gladstone reprints of The Haunt of Fear The Vault of Horror and Weird Science all 1992 Gemstone also republished in single issue and ' annual ' four issues per ' annual ' format EC's New Trend and New Direction titles with the exception of Mad between 1992 and 2000 In 2005 Gemstone added to Cochran's earlier published oversize hardback black white slip cased The Complete EC Library collections with the complete Pic to Fiction collection comprising the EC comics Confessions Illustrated Crime Illustrated Shock Illustrated and Terror Illustrated

Archives and Marvel Masterworks volumes which reprint in full color hardback ' archival ' format sequential compilations of the EC Comics titles Designed by art director designer Michael Krone nberg a number of volumes have been released with the entirety of the New Trend and New Direction planned for eventual release 66 These EC Archives volumes have drawn praise for their quality and feature introductions by such notable EC fans as George Lucas Steven Spielberg Joe Dante and Paul Levi tz In December 2002 it was announced that Gemstone Publishing had signed the license to publishing Disney comics in North America with ex Gladstone Publishing editor in chief John Clark joining Gemstone in the same position over its Disney line 67 Launched with a title for Free Comic Book Day 2003 the line started soon after with Walt Disney's Comics and Stories and Walt Disney's Uncle Scrooge both described by Clark as monthly 64 page prestige format books at 6 95 which is the same price they were when last produced in 1998 67 Other titles followed and Gemstone held their license until early 2009 68 The Official Over street Comic Book Price Guide was first published by Robert M Over street in 1970 as one of the earliest authorities on American comic book industry grading and collection values Over street sold his company to Gemstone in 1994 69 but continued to serve as author and or publisher of Ge ppi's Entertainment Publishing Auctions ' line of books 70 Publication of the Price Guide was taken over by Gemstone in 1998 and the twenty eighth edition to the present have been co

the yearly price guide more regularly as well as provide articles analysis and various lists of comics prices Gemstone published more than a hundred issues of the magazine Comic Book Marketplace a monthly magazine for comics fans focusing heavily on the Golden and Silver ages while more popular magazines such as Wizard skew more recent in focus In early 2009 the future of Gemstone Publishing was unclear after reports of unpaid printing bills particularly from the EC Archives 72 In April Ge ppi responded to the uncertainty noting that while there had been a reduction in staff at Gemstone such moves did not signal the end of Gemstone Publishing 73 In 2008 Diamond introduced Comic Suite an add on application for Microsoft Dynamics Retail Management System RMS software Together Comic
