    "transformers_text": "The Hollywood Reporter THR is an American digital and print magazine which focuses on the film television theatre and entertainment industries It was founded in 1930 as a daily trade paper and in 2010 switched to a weekly large format print magazine with a revamped website As of 2020 the day to day operations of the company are handled by Penske Media Corporation through a joint venture with Eldridge Industries The Hollywood Reporter has international editions in several countries The magazine also sponsors and hosts major industry events The Hollywood Reporter was founded in 1930 by William R Billy Wilkerson 1890 1962 as Hollywood's first daily entertainment trade newspaper 1 The first edition appeared on September 3 1930 and featured Wilkerson's front page Trade views column 2 which became influential The newspaper appeared Monday to Saturday for the first 10 years except for a brief period then Monday to Friday from 1940 Wilkerson used caustic articles and gossip to generate publicity and was noticed by the studio bosses in New York and some studio lots tried to ban the paper 3 In 1932 Variety sued The Hollywood Reporter alleging that THR was plagiarizing information from Variety following its publication in New York on Tuesdays by way of phoning or wiring the information back to Hollywood so that THR could publish the information before Variety reached Hollywood three days later on Friday 4 Then in 1933 Variety started its own daily Hollywood edition Daily Variety to cover the film industry 5 Screenwriter and ardent anti Communist 6 Jack Moffitt who had written the scripts for dozens of films during Hollywood's Golden Age and was the father of model and actress Peggy Moffitt wrote many reviews for THR 7 8 9 after being hired by Wilkerson in 1955 6 Wilkerson became friends with Howard Hughes and the paper wrote many favorable stories about him and his film plans In return Hughes in addition to advertising revenue also provided financial assistance to the paper when necessary 3 Wilkerson ran The Hollywood Reporter until his death in September 1962 although his final column appeared 18 months prior 10 Wilkerson's wife T ichi Wilkerson Kassel took over as publisher and editor in chief when her husband died 11 From the late 1930 s Wilkerson used The Hollywood Reporter to push the view that the industry was a communist stronghold In particular he opposed the screenplay writers ' trade union the Screen Writers Guild which he called the Red Beachhead 12 13 In 1946 the Guild considered creating an American Authors ' Authority to hold copyright for writers instead of ownership passing to the studios Wilkerson devoted his Trade views column to the issue on July 29 1946 headlined A Vote for Joe Stalin He went to confession before publishing it knowing the damage it would cause but was apparently encouraged by the priest to go ahead with it 12 14 The column contained the first industry names including Dalton T rum bo and Howard Koch on what became the Hollywood blacklist known as Billy's list Eight of the 11 people Wilkerson named were among the Hollywood Ten who were blacklisted after hearings in 1947 by the House Un American Activities Committee 12 15 When Wilkerson died in 1962 his THR obituary said that he had named names pseudonyms and card numbers and was widely credited with being chiefly responsible for preventing communists from becoming entrenched in Hollywood production 12 In 1997 THR reporter David Robb wrote a story about the newspaper's involvement but the editor Robert J Dowling declined to run it For the blacklist's 65 th anniversary in 2012 the THR published a lengthy investigative piece about Wilkerson's role by reporters Gary Baum and Daniel Miller 12 The same edition carried an apology from Wilkerson's son W R Wilkerson III He wrote that his father had been motivated by revenge for his thwarted ambition to own a studio 16 On April 11 1988 T ichi Wilkerson Kassel sold the paper to BPI Communications owned by Affiliated Publications for 26 7 million 17 Robert J Dowling became THR president in 1988 and editor in chief and publisher in 1991 10 Dowling hired Alex Ben Block as editor in 1990 Block and Teri Ritz er damped much of the sensationalism and cronyism that was prominent in the paper under the Wilkerson s In 1994 BPI Communications was sold to Vere nig de Nederlandse U it g ever i jen V NU for 220 million 18 In March 2006 a private equity consortium led by Blackstone and K KR both with ties to the conservative movement in the United States acquired THR along with the other assets of V NU 19 It joined those publications with Ad Week and A C Nielsen to form The Nielsen Company 20 Matthew King vice president for content and audience editorial director Howard Burns and executive editor Peter Pryor left the paper in a wave of layoffs in December 2006 editor Cynthia Littleton widely respected throughout the industry reported directly to K il cullen The Reporter absorbed another blow when Littleton left her position for an editorial job at Variety in March 2007 Web editor Glenn Abel also left after 16

daily trade paper and reinvent it as a glossy large format weekly magazine 25 26 The Hollywood Reporter relaunched with a weekly print edition and a revamped website that enabled it to break news Eight months after its initial report The New York Times took note of the many scoops THR had generated adding that the new glossy format seemed to be succeeding with its rarefied demographic stating They managed to change the subject by going weekly The large photos lush paper stock and great design are a kind of narcotic here 27 In 2011 Deadline Hollywood a property of Penske Media Corporation sued The Hollywood Reporter for more than 5 million alleging copyright infringement In 2013 THR's parent company settled the suit According to The Wall Street Journal The lawsuit was widely viewed in Hollywood as a proxy for the bitter war for readers and advertising dollars The two sides agreed on a statement reading in part ' Prometheus admits that The Hollywood Reporter copied source code from Penske Media Corporation's Web site www tv line com Prometheus and The Hollywood Reporter have apologized to Penske Media ' 28 By February 2013 the Times returned to THR filing a report on a party for Academy Award nominees the magazine had hosted at the Los Angeles restaurantS pago Noting the crowd of top celebrities in attendance the Times alluded to the fact that many Hollywood insiders were now referring to THR as the new Vanity Fair Ad sales since Min's hiring were up more than 50 while traffic to the magazine's website had grown by 800 29 In January 2014 Janice Min was promoted to
