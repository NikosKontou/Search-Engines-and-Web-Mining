as a Tanuki and he angrily corrects them pointing out that he is a To nakai Japanese for Reindeer With Chopper's back story Oda wanted to illustrate that one need not be blood related to be considered family 5 6 7 When asked by a fan what the nationalities of the members of the Straw Hat Pirates would be if One Piece was set in the real world Oda replied that Chopper would be Canadian 8 Chopper is

Chopper grew up on the winter island Drum where he was an outcast among reindeer due to his blue nose He ate the Human Human Fruit Hito Hito no Mi giving him the ability to speak think and transform into a human This ability further alienated him from the other reindeer and he was rejected by the herd He grew up an outcast until taken in by the fake doctor Hi ril uk a former thief who accepts Chopper as his son and instills within him his initial passion for medicine After Hi ril uk's death Chopper becomes Dr Kure ha's assistant and learns her medical knowledge Luffy tries to convince Chopper to join the crew as the ship's Doctor A frightened Chopper continues to give Luffy the slip and later explains he can't be part of the crew because he is a monster Luffy tells Chopper to shut up and come with them regardless which moves Chopper to tears as he has finally found real friends people who aren't afraid of him 13 Chopper is the doctor of the crew and has outstanding knowledge of medicine and medical drugs as well as the preparation of remedies and ointments from regular fruits roots and vegetables found on most islands Most of this he learned during his apprenticeship under Dr Kure ha or from his time at the Birdie Kingdom Chopper stands at a height of 90 centimetres 2 ft 11 in and weighs 20 kg 44 lb in his Brain Point form He possesses extraordinary genius level intelligence excelling in medicine surgery and pharmacology His power ranking is classified as Class A with attack potency ranging from Large Building to City Block level His speed varies from Supersonic to Hypersonic and his lifting strength is rated between Class 5 and Class M In battle Chopper is an expert fighter who leverages his transformative abilities to gain advantages He has enhanced stamina at an exceptional human level and durability comparable to City Block level However his primary weakness is that he becomes immobilized if more than half of his body is submerged in water 14 Chopper found a genuine feeling of family after joining the Straw Hats where his friends encourage him as a person and as a doctor He treats injuries and illnesses and creates antidotes in emergency situations because of his medical knowledge and charming demeanor which makes him a vital member of the crew During the Punk Hazard arc one of his greatest accomplishments was developing an antidote to protect youngsters Caesar Clown experimented on 15 Chopper has appeared in other media besides the manga and its television anime adaptation He is featured in most of the One Piece films starting with Movie 3 Chopper's Kingdom of Strange Animal Island where he is the main character He is also the main character in the ninth movie which is a retelling of the storyline during which he was introduced Chopper has appeared in many One Piece licensed electronic video games Though in the game One Piece Grand Battle he is not labeled as a Straw Hat character and has no alliance in the game Though like the rest of the Straw Hat's he has unlockable costumes outside of his alternate colors In One Piece Grand Adventure he is aligned with the Straw Hats He is also a support character in Jump Super Stars In 2006 he is featured in the Dragon Ball One Piece Naruto crossover game Battle Stadium D O N as a playable character Chopper was seen in Bo kusatsu Ten shi Do kuro chan when Sakura mentions reindeer who are doctors and other things from anime while he was freaking out in a forest He also appears twice in the Webcomic VG Cats Chopper and other characters also appeared in Cross Epoch a crossover between One Piece and Dragon Ball Z There have been various pieces of merchandise released for Chopper over the years Various plush figures have been based on him including many season based ones 16 17 as well as an assortment of others 18 There have also been many figures released of Chopper 19 20 21 Additionally there have been many other pieces of merchandise based on Chopper such as cushions 22 clothing 23 towels 24 key chains 25 and clocks 26 Sean Cu bill as of Screen Rant ranked Chopper third on a top ten list of the most adorable anthropomorphic anime animals writing It makes sense that the best selling manga of all time would also have one of the cutest talking animal characters of all time Though berated by humans as a monster and even as an outcast by other reindeer Tony Tony Chopper hasn't become anything less than a friendly welcome face for all the fans It also helps that there's just a lot of One Piece mer ch centered around him 27 In a review Cu bill as writes Tony Tony Chopper on design alone is already plenty iconic He's meant to be the mascot for the series and after seeing all of the One Piece mer ch with his face on it he's done a pretty good job The scene to define him however comes in his backstory After tragically losing Dr Hi lulu k to a political assassination his own poison mushroom soup and an undisclosed terminal illness Chopper runs to Dr Kure ha's office waving Hi lulu k's pirate flag He begs the old woman to teach him proclaiming that he wants to be a doctor that can cure any disease 28 In another article Cu bill as uniquely gave Chopper two entries in his ranking of the series top ten running gags noting Part of the Cowardly Trio Chopper is as up for a fight as Us opp with an actual illness Unfortunately for him he can't quite hide away it's easy to understand why most characters who see him for the first time tend to think that he's a tanuki or a raccoon dog While Chopper has some kinship with other animals he certainly doesn't like being mis labeled particularly when this denotes him as the Straw Hat's pet and not as the talented doctor that he truly is 29 An IGN review of the manga praised Chopper's character as one of the best in the series and said that he was able to be both touching and funny 30 However Chopper's status as a mascot met with criticism by both fans and critics who view him as too stereotypical and insufficiently developed compared to the other Straw Hats Dy ler Crews wrote Even before Pikachu solidified the concept of a manga and anime franchise having an adorable mascot in the ' 90 s the trope was already old hat Looking to cash in on merchandising Oda simplified Tony Tony Chopper's design to make the character resemble a plush toy Although Oda didn't relegate Chopper to mascot status only giving the character an essential job within the crew Chopper's utility in the story has diminished as his marketability grew Chopper is now often used for jokes or cute moments instead of playing a central role as the crew's doctor in important storylines 1 Having the voice actor behind Pikachu didn't help either 31 Chopper ranked in the top ten during the second through seventh popularity polls Chopper was the fourth most popular character in the second third and fourth Japanese popularity polls He was ranked the seventh most popular character in the fifth and sixth Japanese popularity poll In the first worldwide popularity poll Chopper was ranked the sixteenth most favorite character 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 The denouement of Chopper's introduction arc was rated the ninth most heartbreaking scene in One Piece and Chopper was involved in half of the top ten most heartbreaking scenes in the manga the Going Merry's funeral Robin saying she wants to live the Straw Hats ' departure the Going Merry rescuing the Straw Hats and the aforementioned denouement when Kure ha fulfills Hi ril uk's dying wish by making Drum bloom like a Sakura tree 39 Jamie Lee Curtis said Chopper was her favorite character and that she was interested in playing Kure ha Chopper's mentor in the live action adaptation 40 although she ultimately did not play the character due to scheduling conflicts 41",
